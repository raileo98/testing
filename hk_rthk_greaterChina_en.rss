    Charm offensive as Xi ramps up 'people diplomacy'

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping’s latest trip to Europe was one of the signs that Beijing is ramping up "people-to-people" diplomacy to counter-balance trade tensions, as the president went on a charm offensive to boost economic ties with central and southeast Europe, according to a political commentator.

Speaking after the president wrapped up his visit to France, Serbia and Hungary, Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and the chairman of Asia Narratives, told RTHK that Xi also hoped to show Europe that what China had been doing over the past 10 years - including with the Belt and Road Initiative - "has been all trade and growth".

"Over 50 different agreements were signed between China and these three nations, covering all areas...," he said.

"What he’s doing is definitely people-to-people diplomacy, especially at the higher level, you could see very clearly that he had a very good rapport on a personal level with President Macron, as well as [the] leaders of both Hungary and Serbia, and he actually stayed an extra couple of hours in Serbia," Tangen said.

Xi’s visit to the region, which was the first in five years, came at a critical time amid mounting trade pressure, with the European Union (EU) pressing ahead with investigations into China's critical sectors, including electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, and medical devices - in a bid to ease the bloc’s trade deficit with China.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier told reporters after talks with Xi that the European Union was "ready to make full use of trade defence instruments" to defend European economies, but Tangen rejected this.

"The overcapacity issue [raised] is completely false," Tangen commented. He said that when Europe and America dominated manufacturing worldwide, they attributed it to market competition and the natural superiority of their products.

"Today, as China is able to sell goods and services at a lower rate, all of a sudden it became 'why hasn’t China been watching out for Europe and the US?'" Tangen said.

"The fact is, these are developed dominant countries that cannot fulfil their own needs and desires from their own countries. If they weren't buying from China, they would be buying from somewhere else, [so] it’s not going to address their trade deficit."

"What the EU should really be concerned about is their competitiveness. What is the future of the EU?"

With over half of the world's population heading to vote for new leaders of more than 80 nations over the course of 2024, Tangen expects trade tensions to continue in the short and medium term as policymakers court voters.
 
"Really, communication is absolutely key," Tangen said. "And in the long term it is about people-to-people exchanges. It takes time and you have to be willing to wait and engage."

"Concentrating on sports and education, and bringing young people into the play. And this is a very long-term strategy by the Chinese government."]]>

    <![CDATA[China's inflation rate quickened last month, according to official data released on Saturday.

The consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3 percent year-on-year in April, staying in positive territory for the third straight month, according to the  National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

That compared with a 0.2 percent rise forecast by Bloomberg analysts and was higher than the 0.1 percent increase in March.

"In April, household consumption demand continued to rebound... and the year-on-year increase expanded," the NBS said in a statement.

However, the producer price index sank by 2.5 percent year-on-year, the NBS said. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), Xia Baolong, said the central government will continue to support the SAR's development into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre.

Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, met Xia in Beijing on Thursday, to brief him on Hong Kong’s efforts in attracting strategic I&T enterprises and talent, as well as the city’s latest developments in areas like digital economy.
 
Xia said the SAR government's work deserves full recognition, and that Beijing will continue to support Hong Kong.

Sun, for his part, said the SAR administration will "live up to its mission" and continue strengthening I&T co-operation with different mainland cities.

Separately, Xia also met with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung, and expressed the need for Hong Kong to continue developing the tourism sector. 

Having experienced profound changes in both the internal and external environment, he said the city's travel industry needs to identify new ways to boost growth. 

The HKMAO chief added that the SAR should adopt the strategy of "tourism everywhere", and develop new routes and products to consolidate Hong Kong's reputation as the best travel destination.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Commerce Ministry on Wednesday said it firmly opposes the US withdrawing export licences to telecommunications equipment maker Huawei, as it also vowed to take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interest of Chinese firms.

The remarks came after the US Commerce Department on Tuesday confirmed that it has revoked some export licences related to Huawei.

Earlier, a Reuters report, citing sources, noted that the US government has withdrawn special licences that allows chip suppliers Qualcomm and Intel to sell order-generation semiconductors to Huawei for use in its laptops and handsets.

Beijing called the move by Washington “a typical practice of economic coercion” and a “violation to its commitment to not decouple from China”.

“The US has generalised the concept of national security, politicised economic and trade issues, abused export control measures, and repeatedly imposed unreasonable sanctions and repression on specific Chinese firms. China is firmly opposed to this,” a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in response to media inquiry on the reported cancellation.

“It not only violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, but also severely harms the interests of US companies. What the US has done has significantly violated its commitment,” the spokesperson added, citing that these actions are also in stark contrast to the US claim of “precisely defining national security”.

Huawei did not immediately comment on the decision by the US Commerce Department.

The cancellations came after the release last month of Huawei’s first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro, powered by Intel’s new Core Ultra9 processor.

The company was placed on a US trade restriction list in 2019 amid spying concerns.]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that a free trade agreement between China and Serbia will take effect on July 1.

It is one of six measures announced by the president to support the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future, as he met the press with his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic, after they held talks in Belgrade.

Serbia is the first European country to build such a community with China.

Among the other measures announced by Xi, there will be more direct flights between Belgrade and Shanghai and airlines will be encouraged to launch direct flights between Belgrade and Guangzhou, and China is ready to import more high-quality agricultural products from Serbia.

"It is a strategic choice made by both sides to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. Its goal is to realise the aspiration of the two peoples for a better life. Its foundation and driving force come from the firm support and extensive participation of the two peoples," Xi said in a joint press conference with Vucic.

Vucic called Xi an “ironclad” friend and said his visit to Serbia is “historic” because it opens the path for even closer ties.

In a joint statement, the two countries said they decided to deepen and elevate the China-Serbia comprehensive strategic partnership.

Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday night on the second leg of his European tour.

The visit comes on the anniversary of the Nato bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 1999 during a campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The bombing killed three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 Chinese nationals.

"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself," Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday. (Xinhua and agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping on Wednesday held talks with his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic on the second leg of his European tour.

Xi said his visit to Serbia will open a new chapter in bilateral ties.

The president was greeted by Vucic outside the main government offices in central Belgrade.

Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday evening from France.

Later on Wednesday, Xi will head to Hungary for a state visit marking 75 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries.

In an article published in the Hungarian newspaper Magyar Nemzet, he noted that the upcoming visit would be his second to Hungary in 15 years.

The president wrote that the two countries stood together in solidarity over the years amid challenges such as the global financial crisis and Covid-19.

"Over the past 75 years, China and Hungary have remained good partners for win-win cooperation. Focusing on high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, our two countries are strengthening synergy in development strategies and deepening results-oriented cooperation in such areas as investment, infrastructure, finance, new energy, and telecommunication technology," the article read.

"Our bilateral cooperation is strong, fruitful, and dynamic."

Xi stressed the need for Beijing and Budapest to further boost friendship and cooperation and to expand cultural and people-to-people exchanges. (Xinhua and agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday evening, after French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a high altitude lunch at a childhood haunt in the Pyrenees mountains for the Chinese leader.

On the next step in his European tour, Xi will hold talks with President Aleksandar Vucic in Serbia, where China has invested heavily to expand its economic footprint.

Serbian state broadcaster RTS showed Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan descend from their Air China aeroplane to be greeted by Vucic, with a small crowd of welcomers waiting along a red carpet dressed in traditional clothing and holding flags and flowers.

"China and Serbia enjoy profound traditional friendship. Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations," Xi said in a written statement issued by Xinhua news agency upon his arrival.

Xi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to have in-depth exchange of views with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on bilateral relationship and other issues of mutual interest.

"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations," he said. 

In France, Macron pressed a message to Beijing not to support Russia's war against Ukraine and to accept fairer trade.

But the other two countries chosen by Xi for his first trip to Europe since 2019 – Hungary is his final stop after Serbia – are seen as among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.

The first day of Xi's state visit to France saw respectful but sometimes robust exchanges between the two presidents during a succession of talks on Monday.

Macron, joined initially by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, urged Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its war with Ukraine and asked Beijing to do all it could to end the conflict.

Xi, for his part, warned the West not to "smear" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.

China has poured billions into Serbia and neighbouring Balkan countries, and last year Beijing and Belgrade signed a free trade agreement.

Serbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told the RTS broadcaster that talks on Wednesday would centre on "a great project." (Xinhua/AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping on Tuesday continued his state visit to France by visiting the Pyrenees mountains, where he met his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.

At the Tarbes-Lourdes Pyrenees airport, Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, were greeted by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, who took them to lunch high up in the mountains.

After watching traditional dancers perform under the snowy peaks, they ate locally grown ham, lamb, cheese and blueberry pie. Xi said he would give the ham some publicity and also praised the cheese.

Macron gifted Xi a woollen blanket made in the Pyrenees, a Tour de France jersey and armagnac from the nearby southwestern region.

Advisers to the French president described the Pyrenees trip as breaking with protocol for a chance for one-on-one chats with Xi in mountains dear to Macron as the birthplace of his maternal grandmother.

Xi has said he would welcome more high-level talks on trade frictions, and has denied there was a Chinese "overcapacity problem". 

Macron has made trade a priority in the talks, underscoring that Europe must defend its "strategic interests" in its economic relations with China.

Meanwhile, Chinese and French companies had concluded some agreements on Monday ranging from energy, finance and transport on the sidelines of Xi's visit, but most were agreements to cooperate or renewed commitments to work together, and there were no significant deals.

In a sign of some progress, China will allow imports of pig origin protein feed as well as pork offal from France effective immediately, according to statements from Chinese customs and the French farm ministry.

But European hopes of an Airbus plane order to coincide with Xi's visit appear to have been dashed, with the two sides agreeing only to expand co-operation.

Xi travels later on Tuesday to Serbia. 

Writing in Serbian daily Politika ahead of arriving in Belgrade, Xi criticised Nato for its "flagrant" bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in 1999, warning Beijing would "never allow such tragic history to repeat itself". (Reuters/AFP)]]>

President Xi Jinping also said he would welcome President Macron to visit China again.

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping on Monday attended a China-France-EU trilateral meeting with French leader Emmanuel Macron and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at the Elysee Palace in Paris.

Xi said China regarded Europe as an important partner in helping it achieve its modernisation goals and said the two sides should stay committed to their partnership.

The president added China regarded Europe as a priority of its foreign policy, and sees China-EU relations from a strategic and long-term perspective.

Xi's French counterpart, Macron, said the international situation made EU-China dialogue more essential than ever, adding it was important to ensure a level playing field between the two sides.

Trade, Sino-European relations, the war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East dominated talks between the three leaders.

Macron said coordination with Beijing on "major crises" including Ukraine was "absolutely decisive".

Xi said China had been working "vigorously" to facilitate talks for peace in Ukraine while adding that Beijing was ready to work with the EU to support a more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 

On trade, Macron urged "fair rules for all" while the EU's von der Leyen said relations between Brussels and Beijing were challenged over issues linked to market access. 

Xi said whether viewed from the perspective of comparative advantage or global market demand, there was no such thing as "China's overcapacity problem". (Xinhua/Reuters)

    <![CDATA[China saw a 35 percent jump in the number of arrivals and departures during the May Day holiday from a year ago.

According to the National Immigration Administration, border inspection agencies across the country handled nearly 8.47 million entry and exit trips during the five-day holiday that ended on Sunday.

That's a 35.1 percent increase year on year.

Officials said the number of arrivals and departures peaked on May 3, with more than 1.8 million.

Mainland travellers accounted for more than half of all the trips, at 4.77 million; people from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan made 2.92 million trips; and travellers from abroad accounted for the rest. 

Meanwhile, data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism showed about 295 million domestic tourist trips were made during the May Day holiday, up 7.6 percent year on year and 28.2 percent from the same period in 2019.

The ministry said both inbound and outbound tourism have been recovering rapidly, due to the resumption of more air routes and introduction of measures to facilitate visitors' entry, among other factors (Reporting by Xinhua)

    Chang'e-6 blasts off to far side of the moon

    <![CDATA[A Long March-5 rocket, carrying the Chang'e-6 spacecraft, blasted off from its launchpad at the Wenchang Space Launch Site in Hainan on Friday afternoon. 

The Chang'e-6 mission is tasked with collecting and returning samples from the moon's mysterious far side, the first endeavor of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration.

"Collecting and returning samples from the far side of the moon is an unprecedented feat. Now we know very little about the moon's far side. If the Chang'e-6 mission can achieve its goal, it will provide scientists with the first direct evidence to understand the environment and material composition of the far side of the moon, which is of great significance," said Wu Weiren, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and chief designer of China's lunar exploration program.

The Chang'e-6 spacecraft, like its predecessor Chang'e-5, comprises an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a returner. 

After it reaches the moon, it will make a soft landing on the far side. Within 48 hours after landing, a robotic arm will be extended to scoop rocks and soil from the lunar surface, and a drill will bore into the ground. Scientific detection work will be carried out simultaneously.

After the samples are sealed in a container, the ascender will take off from the moon and dock with the orbiter in lunar orbit. 

The returner will then carry the samples back to Earth, landing in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The entire flight is expected to last about 53 days, the China National Space Administration said. (Xinhua)]]>
