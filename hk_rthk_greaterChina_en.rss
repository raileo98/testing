    <![CDATA[China condemned on Tuesday what it called "groundless accusations" by the United States that Beijing is supporting Russia's war in Ukraine.

"The United States has unveiled a large-scale aid bill for Ukraine while also making groundless accusations against normal trade between China and Russia," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.

"This kind of approach is extremely hypocritical and utterly irresponsible, and China is firmly opposed to it," he said.

Wang reiterated that China has consistently maintained that it is a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict.

"On the Ukraine issue, China has always maintained an objective and just position, advocated actively for peace talks and pushed for a political resolution," Wang said.

He added that Beijing will not accept others "passing the buck" or shifting the blame. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Rescue operations were underway after unseasonably heavy rain caused rivers to overflow, triggering landslides in Yingde city in flood-ravaged Guangdong province, broadcaster CCTV reported on Tuesday.

It comes as the latest figures showed that four people have died as a result of the heavy rain, and 10 others are still missing. Provincial authorities have relocated some 110,000 residents so far.

Rescue and emergency workers were seen tending to stranded residents on rescue boats in residential areas as well as commercial streets, in video aired by CCTV. The broadcaster also reported emergency supplies including food, water and other amenities were being provided.

In one village, farmers stood at a flooded intersection along with belongings they managed to save, including a washing machine.

“Everything's gone, all the seedlings are gone," said Huang Jingrong, 61.

"It's all flooded, flooded beyond repair," he said, estimating his losses at about 100,000 yuan.

Meanwhile, massive flooding has occurred in Beijiang River in the Pearl River basin on Monday due to the continuous heavy rain, according to the Ministry of Water Resources.

Guangdong has been battered by unusually heavy, sustained and widespread rainfall since Thursday, with powerful storms ushering in an earlier-than-normal start to the region's annual flooding season. (Reuters/Xinhua)]]>

    No systemic Chinese doping, says Australian swim coach

    <![CDATA[Australian swimming coach Denis Cotterell has rejected allegations of orchestrated doping in Chinese swimming, saying China is adamant about clean sport.

Cotterell is working with China's top swimmers in the lead-up to the Paris Olympics and previously coached 1,500 metres freestyle world record holder Sun Yang, who is now suspended for a doping offence.

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) confirmed reports over the weekend that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned drug before the Tokyo Olympics.

WADA said it had accepted China's findings that the results were due to contamination and decided against appealing the matter, triggering criticism from top swimmers and the US anti-doping authority.

Cotterell told the Sydney Morning Herald he stood by his swimmers "100%" and said any positive test results in Chinese swimming were not part of a state-run programme.

"I am happy to say I’m absolutely in support of my swimmers and dispute any suggestion of anything orchestrated," Cotterell said.

"The suggestion that it's systemic is so far from anything I have seen here the whole time.

"They are so adamant on having clean sport.

"It's sad to see what this suggests or looks like. It’s unfortunate for everyone. I feel for the athletes here because of how hard they work now to eliminate the tag that was garnered in the '90s."

Leading coaches and swimmers criticised WADA and China's anti-doping authority over the weekend and questioned why the 23 swimmers' test results were not made public.

Cotterell said he understood if rival swimmers were upset and that the process could have been better handled.

"It unfortunately allows that doubt to come out and to surface. I can’t prove anything, I just know the truth," he said.

However, he was also insistent that failed drug tests from contaminated food was a consistent risk in China.

"(Swimmers) are not allowed to eat outside anywhere. When they go on a plane, they can’t eat the food," he added.

Media reports said the swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine (TMZ), which is found in heart medication, months before the Tokyo Games started in July 2021. 

WADA said after reviewing a television documentary and newspaper reports that it stands by its decision to clear the 23 swimmers to compete at the Tokyo Olympics. 

The anti-doping agency issued a statement on Sunday following the release of a documentary on the cases by German broadcaster ARD.

In an earlier statement following initial newspaper reports, WADA said it agreed with Chinese authorities and ruled that the swimmers’ samples had been contaminated.

The New York Times reported that Chinese anti-doping authorities found the results of the tests were Adverse Analytical Findings but cleared the swimmers without any penalties after finding that the samples were flagged as positive as a result of contamination.

“Following WADA’s review of the documentary, the agency still stands firmly by the results of its scientific investigation and legal decision concerning the case,” WADA said in the statement on Sunday. 

“We are equally confident that WADA’s independent Intelligence and Investigations Department followed up on all allegations received, which were not corroborated by any evidence; and thus, did not meet WADA threshold to open an investigation.”

WADA said based on available scientific evidence and intelligence, “which was gathered, assessed and tested by experts in the pharmacology of trimetazidine (TMZ); and, by anti-doping experts,” it had no basis under the global anti-doping code to challenge the Chinese agency's findings of environmental contamination. 

The Foreign Ministry on Monday called reports about the swimmers testing positive "fake news".

"I believe you will also have noted that the World Anti-Doping Agency has put out a very clear response," spokesman Weng Wenbin told a regular briefing.

"After an in-depth and detailed investigation of this incident by the China anti-doping centre in 2021, it was determined that the relevant athletes had ingested contaminated drugs without their knowledge.

"The Chinese swimmers involved were neither at fault nor guilty of negligence, and their behaviour did not constitute a doping violation.

"After an investigation, WADA affirmed the findings of the China anti-doping centre."

Wang added that Beijing has a zero-tolerance position towards doping.

"We strictly adhere to the (relevant) global provisions and resolutely protect the physical and mental health of athletes.

"We uphold fair competition in sports events and have made active contributions to the global fight against doping," he said. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[Authorities in Guangdong on Monday said four people were killed and 10 people were missing after continuous heavy rainfall hit many parts of the province over the past few days. 

The three deaths were reported in Zhaoqing City, while the remaining one is a rescuer in Shaoguan City.

Guangdong's provincial emergency management department said search and rescue operations were still underway.

The heavy rain affected many cities including the provincial capital of Guangzhou, resulting in damaged houses, blocked roads and landslides.

The department said it has so far relocated some 110,000 residents, with 25,800 people being urgently resettled.

Scores of homes either collapsed or were badly damaged, resulting in an economic loss of over 110 million yuan according to officials. 

Rainfall was forecast to continue over the coming three days across the southern regions, with rainstorms hitting parts of Guangdong and Fujian provinces, the National Meteorological Centre said.
 
Persistent heavy rain has affected south China since April 19, with precipitation reaching record highs in several areas. 

Vast regions of the country's south and southwest were expected to see a 50 to 80 percent increase in precipitation in late April compared with the same period in previous years. 

Officials said due to the heavy rain, water levels in 44 rivers within the Pearl River basin had exceeded warning levels as of April 21.

China issued a yellow alert for rainstorms on Monday morning, the third most severe level in the country's four-tier, colour-coded weather warning system. (Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[China's ambassador to the United States said on Saturday that the two countries need to keep working to improve relations amid "unprecedented challenges".

Xie Feng made the comments at Harvard University ahead of a visit to Beijing this week by the top US diplomat, Antony Blinken.

“Whether the younger generation can continue to enjoy the eight-decade-long peace and development as their parents did depends largely on whether China and the United States can find the right way to get along in the new era,” Xie said in comments released by the embassy on Sunday.

Xie said talks in California between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, in November had injected stability into the bilateral relationship and also formed a forward-looking “San Francisco vision”. 

“Since the meeting, the two sides have maintained interactions at various levels, and conducted dialogue and cooperation in areas including foreign policy, economy and trade, law enforcement, agriculture, and [military to military] relations,” Xie was quoted by the embassy as saying.

The ambassador acknowledged that there was competition between the two sides and said China would not shy away from such competition as long as it was fair.

He rejected as unfair US claims that China’s lead in areas such as electric vehicles and solar panels was a result of overcapacity, and criticised the US insistence that other countries ban exports of certain products to China.

Blinken arrives in Beijing on Wednesday for three days of talks that are expected to cover the crises in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as bilateral ties.]]>

    <![CDATA[Landslides in southern China injured at least six people and trapped others, state media reported on Sunday, as the region braced for severe floods "seen around once a century."

Torrential downpours across swathes of Guangdong province since Thursday have swollen rivers in the Pearl River Delta and triggered deluges in mountainous areas.

State broadcaster CCTV said on Sunday that rains had sparked landslides affecting six villages in the northern Guangdong town of Jiangwan, "causing people to become trapped."

Photographs published by CCTV showed waterfront homes destroyed by a wall of brown mud, and people in fluorescent-coloured ponchos sheltering in a soaked public sports court.

No deaths were immediately reported and the total number of trapped people was not specified.

But CCTV said six people who were "trapped and injured" in the landslides had been airlifted to the nearby city of Shaoguan.

Emergency workers were racing to restore communications to the stricken area "as soon as possible," CCTV said.

It added that more than 80 rescuers were working "through the day and night" to assist people in the disaster zone.

The Pearl River Delta is China's manufacturing heartland and one of the country's most densely populated regions, with Guangdong alone home to around 127 million people.

Aerial footage by CCTV on Sunday showed murky flood-waters lapping close to street level in some towns, leaving riverside promenades and pavilions inundated and a pagoda protruding from the deluge.

Authorities have launched a level-two emergency response in the Pearl River Delta, the second-highest in a four-tier system.

The national weather office imposed weather alerts across central Guangdong and warned of major storms in coastal areas through Sunday evening and into Monday.

Citing the provincial hydrology bureau, CCTV said three monitored locations in the Bei River basin would "experience flooding seen around once a century... due to the impact of heavy precipitation."

Floods of up to 5.8 metres above the warning limit would strike the areas starting early on Monday morning, according to CCTV.

Several other monitored tributaries in the basin would endure the kind of floods seen once every 50 years, it said.

There were no initial reports of mass evacuations.

Parts of the neighbouring provinces of Jiangxi and Fujian were also forecast to see severe rainstorms. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Triple world champion Max Verstappen took pole position on Saturday for the Chinese Grand Prix, 0.322 seconds ahead of Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso third.

Verstappen clocked a fastest lap of 1 minute and 33.660 seconds to cap a perfect day after earlier winning the sprint race at the Shanghai International Circuit.

Lando Norris will start on the second row in his McLaren alongside Alonso for Sunday's race, the first grand prix to be held in China since 2019 because of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.

Oscar Piastri was fifth fastest in the second McLaren ahead of the Ferrari pair of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, with George Russell's Mercedes eighth.

It was a dominant day for the Dutchman who overcame electrical gremlins to blast from fourth on the grid to an emphatic victory in the morning sprint, 13 seconds ahead of Lewis Hamilton.

The win increased his championship lead over teammate Perez to 25 points.

But Hamilton's joy at coming second in the sprint turned to despair in the first qualifying stint when the Englishman locked up near the end of his final flying lap, relegating him to only 18th fastest.

It was the first time since the 2022 Saudi Grand Prix that the seven-time world champion had been knocked out in Q1. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Max Verstappen overcame early electrical gremlins to blast from fourth on the grid to an emphatic victory in the Chinese Grand Prix sprint race on Saturday, 13 seconds ahead of Lewis Hamilton.

The Dutchman charged past the seven-time world champion Hamilton's Mercedes on lap nine of the 19-lap dash.

Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez was third after a thrilling battle with the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, and the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso.

"The first few laps were hectic," said Verstappen after claiming the eight points on offer for the winner of the first sprint of the season at the Shanghai International Circuit.

"The wind is changing a lot which makes it difficult to drive.

"Once we sorted (the battery) out we were OK," Verstappen added as he extended his championship lead to 25 points over Perez.

Leclerc and Sainz ended up fourth and fifth after swapping places numerous times in the dramatic tussle for the minor places with Perez and Alonso.

Aston Martin's Alonso came out worst as he went wheel-to-wheel with the Ferraris, having to retire his car on lap 18 with a puncture suffered in the skirmish.

On the first Chinese Grand Prix weekend since 2019, huge crowds turned out to see Shanghai native Zhou Guanyu, China's first Formula One driver, make his home debut in his third season in the premier racing class.

Tickets for Sunday's main race sold out in minutes and fans had plenty to cheer Friday when Zhou propelled his Sauber into the top 10 in a wet sprint qualifying session.

He started from 10th and in dry conditions for the race and moved up one place after the opening skirmishes.

Zhou agonisingly finished just out of the points in ninth after being passed late on by Russell, who started down in 11th on the grid but made the most of starting on quicker soft tyres. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The top three in Sunday's Beijing half marathon have been stripped of their medals, organisers said, following an investigation into the finish that saw China's He Jie controversially win.

"Today the 2024 Beijing Half Marathon Organising Committee issued a decision on the investigation and handling of the men's race results," a state media report said on Friday.

It added: "The trophies, medals and bonuses will be recovered."

The race's bizarre finish saw He cross the line first after two runners from Kenya and one from Ethiopia seemed to deliberately allow him to win.

All four were "punished" and their results cancelled, CCTV reported.

The Chinese Athletics Association said earlier this week they had met, issuing a statement vowing to make improvements to the sport in the country. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Mainland immigration authorities on Thursday said the country saw a total of more than 141 million inbound and outbound trips in the first quarter of this year, up 117 percent from the same period last year. 

Nearly 60 million of the trips were made by residents of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, up 100 percent year-on-year. Thirteen million trips were made by foreign nationals, which was triple the number last year. 

The National Immigration Administration (NIA) noted that a number of measures were introduced to boost cross-border travel in the first three months of the year, including visa-free entry policies with some foreign countries, as well as the individual visit scheme for residents of Qingdao and Xi’an to travel to Hong Kong and Macau.

It said it granted 1.98 million foreign travellers visa-free entry during the period, up over 260 percent year-on-year.

NIA spokesperson Lin Yongsheng said the trend of residents of Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan heading to the mainland is continuing, as is the trend of mainlanders heading to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. 

Such traffic has resumed to the level seen in 2019, Lin said, with record breaking daily cross-border trips made at various ports in Hong Kong. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)]]>

    <![CDATA[China and Indonesia want to maintain peace and stability in the region, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Thursday after holding talks with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi in Jakarta.

Wang stressed the need to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.

Marsudi said the two countries would strengthen relations, and said Jakarta was looking to deepen cooperation and investment in energy transition, infrastructure and the downstreaming industry. 

Wang also called for all parties in the Gaza conflict to exercise restraint, and said the United States should support a United Nations resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza.

"Both ministers expressed resentment over the humanitarian disaster due to the Palestine-Israel conflict. We agree that the UN Security Council resolution on a ceasefire must be fully implemented and without any condition," Wang said after the meeting.

Wang is on an official visit to Indonesia, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea from April 18 to 23.

The Foreign Ministry has said he will chair the fourth meeting of the China-Indonesia High-Level Dialogue Cooperation Mechanism and the seventh meeting of the China-Cambodia Intergovernmental Coordination Committee during the trip. (Reuters/Xinhua)]]>

    China slams Biden calls for hikes in steel tariffs

    <![CDATA[The Chinese Embassy in the United States has criticised proposals by US President Joe Biden to impose higher tariffs on Chinese metal products. 

A spokesman for the embassy, Liu Pengyu, said "the US is making the same mistake again and again" by seeking higher tariffs. 

In a statement, he also dismissed levies already in place as “the embodiment of unilateralism and protectionism of the US”.

Biden on Wednesday called for sharply higher American tariffs on Chinese metal products as part of a package of policies aimed at pleasing steelworkers in the swing state of Pennsylvania.

As he campaigned for re-election in the "Steel City" of Pittsburgh, Biden aides said he was proposing raising to 25 percent the tariffs imposed by his predecessor Donald Trump on certain Chinese steel and aluminium products.

"China's steel companies don't need to worry about making a profit," Biden said. "They're not competing, they're cheating and we've seen the damage here in America."

Washington is also pressuring neighbouring Mexico to prohibit China from selling its metal products to the US indirectly from there.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration is launching an investigation into Chinese trade practices across the shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors, which could lead to more tariffs.

In response, the Commerce Ministry said the “US petition is full of false accusations.”

It ”misinterprets normal trade and investment activities as damaging to US national security and corporate interests," the ministry said in a statement. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[Defence Minister Dong Jun has spoken with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, the first engagement the defence chiefs of the two countries have had in more than a year as Beijing and Washington seek to restore military ties.

The Defence Ministry cited Dong as telling Austin on the phone that China and the US should explore ways to "get along" and "gradually accumulate mutual trust" by building a "non-conflict, non-confrontation", pragmatic and cooperative relationship between their militaries.

Dong also said the US should recognise Beijing's position on the South China Sea, and respect China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests there. He also stressed that the Taiwan issue is "core of China's core interests".

"China and the US should... take peace as the most precious, stability as the most important," Dong told Austin, according to a ministry readout.

"The military sphere is the key... to stabilising the development of the relationship and preventing major crises from occurring," Dong added.

For his part, Austin "underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea", according to the Pentagon.

The US said the two also discussed the Ukraine war, North Korea, and Washington's commitment to the one China policy.

The phone call comes as President Xi Jinping and his counterpart, Joe Biden, have sought to manage tensions; the two leaders last year agreed to resume direct military talks. (Reuters/AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping on Tuesday told visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that China and Germany should be vigilant against rising protectionism and view the issue of production capacity objectively.

Xi said the industrial and supply chains of the two countries are deeply intertwined and their markets highly interdependent, and that co-operation was not a "risk" but a guarantee for stable ties and an opportunity for the future.

"We must view and develop bilateral relations in an all-round way from a long-term and strategic perspective," the president said.

Scholz arrived in China on Sunday for a three-day visit, his first since his government launched a "de-risking" strategy last year to avoid relying excessively on Chinese suppliers.

His visit also coincided with European Union concerns about the threat to European businesses from Chinese goods, including electric vehicles and other green technologies, flooding its markets.

Speaking to students at Tongji University in Shanghai on Monday, Scholz called for fair competition in trade relations with China, while urging the EU not to act out of protectionist self-interest.

During his meeting with Xi, Scholz also touched on areas where he said the two countries could cooperate, including climate change.

The two leaders also discussed Ukraine, with Xi proposing four principles to prevent the crisis from spiralling out of control and to restore peace at an early date.

"First, we should prioritise the upholding of peace and stability and refrain from seeking selfish gains. Second, we should cool down the situation and not add fuel to the fire.

"Third, we need to create conditions for the restoration of peace and refrain from further exacerbating tensions. Fourth, we should reduce the negative impact on the world economy and refrain from undermining the stability of global industrial and supply chains," Xi said. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[China's economy grew 5.3 percent in the first quarter year-on-year, official data showed on Tuesday, comfortably beating analysts' expectations, a welcome sign for policymakers as they try to shore up demand and confidence.

Analysts polled by Reuters news agency had expected first-quarter gross domestic product to expand 4.6 percent from a year earlier, compared to 5.2 percent in the previous three months.

Sheng Laiyun, National Bureau of Statistics deputy commissioner, said the nation had made solid progress over the period.

"Generally, in the first quarter, the national economy made a good start, accumulating positive factors and laying a solid foundation for achieving the annual goal," Sheng said.

"However, we should say that there are rising complexities and uncertainties in the external environment," he said, adding that authorities will boost economic vitality, prevent and diffuse risks, as well as enhance the momentum for economic recovery and growth.

Mainland officials are aiming for economic growth of around five percent for 2024, a target that many analysts believe is ambitious and may require more stimulus.

Meanwhile, retail sales and industrial production in China slowed in March.

Retail sales growth slowed to 3.1 percent year-on-year in March, down from a 5.5 percent increase in the first two months of 2024, while industrial production rose 4.5 percent, down from a 7 percent increase in the first two months, official data showed. (Reuters/AFP)

    <![CDATA[German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday called for fair competition in trade relations with China, while also urging the European Union not to act out of protectionist self-interest.

“The one thing that must always be clear is that competition must be fair,” Scholz, who's on a three-day visit to China, told students at Tongji University in Shanghai, according to German news agency dpa.

"In other words, that there is no dumping, that there is no overproduction, that copyrights are not infringed.

“Of course we would like our companies to have no restrictions, but conversely we behave exactly how we are demanding here.”

Scholz is expected to raise the issue of fair competition at a meeting with President Xi Jinping on Tuesday. 

The German chancellor also made comparisons to reservations years ago when Japanese and Korean automakers entered the German market.

“There was great agitation in the newspapers: ‘Now the Japanese cars will come and clean up’... nonsense,” he told the Tongji University students. 

He said there are German cars in China that were made with Chinese manufacturers, and at some point there would also be Chinese cars in Germany and Europe.

The European Union is mulling tariffs to protect its producers against Chinese electric vehicle imports. But the head of Germany’s auto industry association, the VDA, expressed opposition to such tariffs ahead of Scholz’s visit. 

Hildegard Müller told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper the tariffs would not help the European and German auto industries and instead “could quickly have a negative effect in a trade conflict.” (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Sunday expressed deep concern over escalation in the conflict in the Middle East, after Iran launched a massive drone and missile attack on Israel in response to an Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus.

A spokesperson for the ministry called on all parties to exercise calm and restraint after the attacks in the early hours of Sunday.

“The ongoing situation is the latest spillover of the Gaza conflict,” the spokesperson said.

“There should be no more delays in implementing UN Security Council Resolution 2728 and the conflict must end now.”

The spokesperson added: “China calls on the international community, especially countries with influence, to play a constructive role for the peace and stability of the region.”

Earlier on Sunday, the Chinese embassy in Iran advised Chinese nationals and companies in the country to strengthen security precautions, according to official broadcaster CCTV.

A UN Security Council meeting is scheduled to take place later on Sunday. (Additional reporting by Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[China's top legislator and a senior North Korean official emphasised opening a "new chapter" of Beijing-Pyongyang relations, the North's state media said Saturday, as they met for one of the most high-level talks between the allies in years.

Beijing's third highest-ranking official Zhao Leji - the NPC Standing Committee chairman - is on a goodwill visit to the North as the two countries mark 75 years of diplomatic ties.

China is North Korea's most important economic benefactor and diplomatic ally.

Zhao and Choe Ryong-hae, who is the chairman of North Korea's Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, attended an opening ceremony for the "year of DPRK-China friendship" in Pyongyang on Friday, North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said, using the acronym for the North's official name.

"China is ready to work with the DPRK to implement the important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties and the two countries, promote traditional friendship, deepen strategic mutual trust and enhance exchanges and cooperation, so as to jointly write a new chapter of the China-DPRK friendship," Zhao said in a speech, according to Xinhua.

North Korea's Choe said the two countries' relationship "has greeted a new heyday under the wise leadership" of their leaders, KCNA said.

Choe and Zhao were seen sitting next to each other watching performances by what KCNA said were "prestigious art troupes" of the two nations at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre, AFP footage showed. (AFP and Xinhua)]]>

    <![CDATA[Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday urged the United States to play a "constructive role" in the Middle East during a phone call with his US counterpart Antony Blinken.

According to Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, China's top diplomat expressed Beijing's strong condemnation of a deadly Israeli airstrike that destroyed an Iranian diplomatic building in the Syrian capital, Damascus, earlier this month.

The foreign minister emphasised the "inviolable" right to security of diplomatic institutions, and the need to respect the sovereignty of Iran and Syria.

Mao said this round of escalation is the latest manifestation of the spillover from the Gaza conflict, adding that it's imperative for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

She added that China will continue to play a constructive role in the resolution of the Middle East issue, and urged the US to do the same.

The US State Department says Blinken asked Beijing to use its influence to dissuade Iran from striking Israel, after Tehran threatened to retaliate.

Iran had urged the international community to take action against Israel following the attack. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[China’s exports contracted sharply in March while imports also unexpectedly shrank, underlining the task facing the country’s policymakers as they try to shore up a sluggish economy.

Figures from the General Administration of Customs showed that shipments from China slumped 7.5 percent year-on-year to US$279.7 billion, marking the largest fall since last August and missing market forecasts of a 3 percent decline.

It also came in sharp contrast to a 7.1 percent rise during the January-February period.

Imports, meanwhile, also declined last month, dropping 1.9 percent year-on-year to US$221.1 billion, missing an expected 1.4 percent rise. The first two months of the year had seen growth of 3.5 percent.

The latest figures left the country’s trade surplus at US$58.6 billion last month, compared with US$125.1 billion in the January-February period.

For the first quarter, however, both imports and exports rose 1.5 percent.

By region, exports to the US fell 1.3 percent, while imports from the US fell nearly 11 percent in the first quarter. Shipments to Russia rose 3 percent, while those from Russia rose 7 percent.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) remained China’s largest trading partner with exports to the region rising 4.1 percent during the first quarter and imports from the region growing 1 percent.

Wang Lingjun, vice minister of the General Administration of Customs, said that while geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism have brought challenges to global trade, there are signs of a gradual recovery.

He said he expects the country’s trade to stabilise in the second quarter. (Reuters)]]>
