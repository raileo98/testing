    <![CDATA[The Taiwan Affairs Office said the new leader of the Taiwan region, William Lai, sent "a dangerous signal" by seeking "Taiwan independence" and making provocations to undermine cross-strait peace and stability.

Responding to Lai's speech as he took office on Monday, Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Chen Binhua said while the mainstream public aspiration on the island is for peace and development, Lai has ignored the public opinion, exposing his nature of being "a worker for Taiwan independence".

Chen also said Lai sought independence by relying on foreign support.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said "Taiwan independence" is a dead end.

"No matter how the political situation in Taiwan changes, it will not change the historical and legal fact that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one China," Wang said. (Xinhua and agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[Two Chinese warships docked on Sunday at a commercial port in Cambodia in preparation for joint naval exercises between the two countries, with Beijing's ambassador hailing their "ironclad" friendship.

The Jingangshan amphibious warfare ship and Qijiguang training ship sailed in to the Sihanoukville Port, as part of 15 days of land and sea drills involving 760 Chinese military personnel along with around 1,300 Cambodians and 11 Cambodian vessels.

The Qijiguang bore a banner reading "Bring peace and friendship to meet good friends" as it approached the port.

"We are ironclad friends," Chinese ambassador Wang Wentian told reporters on the shore.

“The cooperation between the two armies, between China and Cambodia, is conducive to the security of both countries and the security of the region."

The Jingangshan and the Qijiguang are due to take part in exercises from the Ream Naval Base.

The joint training is the naval component of the ongoing Golden Dragon exercises, which are regularly held between the two countries. (AP & AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Senior Beijing official Xia Baolong highly values Macau's position as an international metropolis and its cooperation with nearby Hengqin, Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng said on Sunday as the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office wrapped up his week-long inspection trip to the gambling hub.

During his visit, Xia met representatives from various sectors, including healthcare, education and technology, to learn more about the latest social and economic developments in the SAR.

Ho said the senior Beijing official described Macau as "the apple of the motherland's eye" and stressed the need to use its advantages to build a "golden business card".

"From my understanding, Director Xia's visit this time is to make an assessment of the current term of the SAR government. It's a great support for our work. They provide suggestions on areas where our work is insufficient," the Macau leader told reporters.

"Regarding our existing problems, they convey what the central government expects from us in meetings with executive, legislative and judicial bodies."

This is Xia's second visit to Macau in as many years and came ahead of the 25th anniversary of the SAR's handover and a new term of government.

Ho said Xia didn't mention the Macau CE election during the visit.

"This time, he emphasised a lot the 'golden business card' of Macau, and he also emphasised that Macau is now an international city, or an international cosmopolitan," Agnes Lam, associate professor at the University of Macau and a former lawmaker, told RTHK.

"I think he didn't mention 'international' that many times last time. I think this is a new emphasis for Macau."

During his trip, Xia visited the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and inspected a number of projects there, and Lam believes it shows the central government wants quicker integration of Macau and Hengqin. 

"I think they urge the progress to be faster. This time, I think Director Xia also visited several key projects, including a residential project named Macau [New] Neighbourhood. And also he asked the whole society to support the government to speed up that project. So I think he also sent a stronger message about we should progress with that project."]]>

    <![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Harbin on Friday to promote trade ties between the two nations on the final day of his state visit in China. 

Lying just a few hundred kilometres from the border with Russia, Harbin has long served as a key hub for cross-border trade and cultural exchange.

The Russian president attended the opening ceremony of a China-Russia trade expo and was accompanied by Vice President Han Zheng.

Speaking at the ceremony, Putin hailed energy ties between the two countries and promised to "strengthen" them.

"Russia is ready and able to continuously power the Chinese economy, businesses, cities and towns with affordable and environmentally clean energy," he said.

"As the world is on the threshold of the next technological revolution, we are determined to consistently deepen bilateral co-operation in the field of high technologies and innovations," he added.

Putin arrived in Beijing on Thursday on his first trip abroad since his March re-election, meeting President Xi Jinping for talks in which the leaders framed their nations' ties as a stabilising force for the world.

The two men later ditched their ties for a less formal meeting over tea at the Zhongnanhai leadership compound. Footage from broadcaster CCTV also showed the leaders embracing.

An editorial in the Global Times newspaper on Friday cited the importance of burgeoning trade ties between the two countries, saying China had been Russia's largest trading partner for 13 straight years. 

"These achievements are not easy and have been achieved by both countries overcoming various external challenges and unfavourable factors, highlighting the solid foundation of the China-Russia relationship," the editorial said. (AFP/Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Beijing on Friday announced some of its most sweeping measures yet to stabilise and revive the country's beleaguered property sector, allowing local governments to buy "some" apartments, relaxing mortgage rules and pledging further efforts to deliver unfinished homes.

Earlier, fresh data showed the fastest drop in new home prices in more than nine years, highlighted continued problems for an industry which at its peak accounted for a fifth of economic activity and remains a major drag on confidence and growth.

Vice Premier He Lifeng told an online meeting with other authorities that municipal governments could buy homes at "reasonable" prices.

The homes would be used to provide affordable housing, He said. 

The vice premier also said local governments could repurchase land sold to developers, and promised authorities would "fight hard" to complete stalled projects.

Separately, the People's Bank of China said it would further lower mortgage interest rates and down-payment requirements.

Shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers soared following the announcement. (Agencies)]]>

    HK court delays Country Garden hearing till June

    <![CDATA[The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition on Friday seeking the liquidation of Chinese property giant Country Garden. 

The decision provides some relief to the embattled developer amid Beijing's efforts to revive the crisis-hit property sector.

A Hong Kong firm filed the petition against Country Garden in February for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. The developer defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds last year and is in the process of an offshore debt restructuring.

Country Garden applied for the adjournment to prepare more evidence. The request was not opposed by the petitioner which filed the action against the company.

If Country Garden is able to present progress on the debt restructuring talks with its offshore creditors, it would help the developer push back against the liquidation petition.

A key group of creditors, the ad hoc group of bondholders, have signalled their "neutral stance" towards the liquidation petition, according to the petitioner's lawyer. 

In a letter to the court, the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing the ad hoc group, said they no longer intended to appear in the court.

The hearing into the petition comes against the backdrop of Beijing stepping up efforts to revive the property sector, which slipped into an unprecedented debt crisis in mid-2021.

Over the past few years, a growing list of developers has defaulted on debt repayment obligations and a handful of them, including China Evergrande, have been ordered to be liquidated. (Reuters)]]>

    'China to play mediating role in Ukraine conflict'

    <![CDATA[Russian President, Vladimir Putin, was on Friday wrapping up his two-day state visit to China with a trip to the northeastern city of Harbin, which has historic ties with Russia.

He will join trade and investment talks there a day after a meeting in Beijing with President Xi Jinping, who told him that China-Russia relations should be "cherished and cared for" by both sides. 

The two also discussed the conflict in Ukraine, with Putin saying he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine.

And hours after Xi and Putin met, US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said that China could not "have its cake and eat it too" with regard to the West and Moscow. 

"It can't have it both ways and want to have [better] relationships with Europe and other countries while simultaneously continuing to fuel the biggest threat to European security in a long time," Patel said, referring to the Ukraine conflict.

Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme, Alan Lung, a political analyst and Co-convenor (International) of the Path of Democracy think tank, said he believes that China is looking to play a mediating role in the Ukraine conflict.

"There are only two countries in the world that doesn't need another country and that is the US and Russia because of its vast territory, but China cannot do that," he said.

"China has bigger stakes and has to cooperate with the West, and this is why China, I think Xi Jinping, desperately wants to, if possible, broker peace in Ukraine on behalf of Russia, on behalf of the Europeans."

On the same programme, Brian Yeung, who wrote a book on his time working in Russia, said he thinks China would not want the situation in Ukraine to undermine its ties with Europe.

"China might be the only, or at least the most important strategic partner to Russia," he said.

"Recently, Xi Jinping also visited Europe and had a very fruitful conversation with the French president. That also signals that China doesn't really want to mess up with Europe for the sake of the China-Russia relationship."

Xin Zhang, an associate professor at the School of Politics and International Relations at East China Normal University, said there are mixed opinions over the ongoing conflict, with some supporting Russia's narrative that the military operation is justified.

"There are also those who are very much on the pro-Ukraine side, looking at this as essentially a big power exploiting a small neighbouring power," he said.

"The situation is complicated. There was a long, complicated historical cause for this conflict to escalate to such a degree. I try to emphasise that China is not the direct party in the conflict, and we would love to see a peaceful resolution through political negotiation."]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping has pledged to work with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to "rejuvenate" their countries as the pair started a day of talks in Beijing.

Putin, for his part, said he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine, adding that he would brief Xi on the situation there.

“China hopes for the early return of Europe to peace and stability and will continue to play a constructive role toward this,” Xi said, speaking alongside Putin.

Beijing last year offered a broad plan for peace outlining general principles for ending the war in Ukraine.

The two leaders also signed a joint statement on deepening China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership marking the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties.

"The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it," Xi said.

"China is willing to... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world."

Xi added that the two countries will continue to uphold a position of non-alliance and non-confrontation.

The Russian leader told Xi that their co-operation was a stabilising factor.

"It is of crucial significance that relations between Russia and China are not opportunistic and are not directed against anyone," Russia's RIA Novosti news agency cited Putin as saying.

Putin on Thursday began a two-day state visit to China that will include detailed talks on Ukraine, Asia, energy and trade with Xi.

Putin will also meet with Premier Li Qiang and visit the northeastern city of Harbin. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping told Russian President Vladimir Putin that China-Russia relations today have not come easily and should be cherished and cared for by both sides, state media said on Thursday.

Xi made the remarks when the two leaders met in Beijing, where he said China will be a good neighbour to Russia.

"On this new journey, China will always be a good neighbour, friend and partner of mutual trust with Russia, and further consolidate the friendship of the people of the two countries," he said.

"China is ready to work together with Russia to achieve development and rejuvenation of our countries and uphold world equality and justice."

Putin is in China for a two-day state visit. He was greeted by officials and an honour guard as he got off his plane in Beijing in the small hours of Thursday.

Later in the morning, Xi held a welcome ceremony for Putin at the square outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People.

During their meeting, Putin said: "Russia-China cooperation is not directed against any other power and is a stabilising factor for the world."

This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election, and the second in just over six months to China.

Before his visit, Putin, in an interview with Xinhua News Agency, had praised Xi for helping to build a strategic partnership between Beijing and Moscow based on national interests and deep mutual trust.

On Ukraine, Putin said: “We are open to a dialogue on Ukraine, but such negotiations must take into account the interests of all countries involved in the conflict, including ours.”

“We are seeking a comprehensive, sustainable and just settlement of this conflict through peaceful means."

China has been involved in efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Beijing's "genuine desire" to help resolve the Ukraine crisis, in an interview with Chinese state media published on Wednesday ahead of a two-day visit to the country.

Putin arrives in Beijing on Thursday to meet his "dear friend" Xi Jinping, seeking to win greater support from China for his war effort in Ukraine and isolated economy.

"We commend China's approaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine," Putin told the Xinhua state news agency in a Moscow interview, which was also carried in English on the Kremlin website.

"Beijing is well aware of its root causes and global geopolitical significance," Putin said, referring to a 12-point position paper published by China in February 2023 on reaching a political settlement to the crisis.

"The ideas and proposals contained in the document show the genuine desire of our Chinese friends to help stabilise the situation," Putin said. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said China is gravely concerned about the prosecution in the UK of three people allegedly working for Hong Kong's intelligence service, and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the country.

“For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.

“China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.”

Britain on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to the UK to state that espionage and cyberattacks were not acceptable on its soil.

The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ambassador Zheng Zeguang had been called to a meeting to be told that “the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyberattacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.”

The Chinese Embassy in London accused Britain of fabricating the charges against the three men.

Zheng said the UK should not interfere in Hong Kong and China's affairs, and should stop making anti-China political provocations.

He also said Britain should not provide refuge to wanted criminals. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[China has spoken out against a move by the United States to hike tariffs on US$18 billion worth of Chinese imports such as electric vehicles (EVs), advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment.

The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminium and more. 

The tariff rate on EVs is set to quadruple to 100 percent this year, the White House said.

Tariffs for semiconductors, meanwhile, will double from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year.

The action is aimed at encouraging China to "eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation," the White House said in a statement.

In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China is opposed to the US tariff hikes and would take measures to defend its interests, urging Washington to cancel the measures.

The Foreign Ministry said it's against unilateral tariff hikes in violation of World Trade Organisation rules.

China "will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests", spokesman Wang Wenbin said.

Xinhua News Agency described it as "a protectionist move widely believed to imperil the American ambition to enhance competitiveness and slash carbon emissions".

The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between US President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin would make a two-day state visit to China from May 16 to 17.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced that Putin was coming at the invitation of President Xi Jinping.

The ministry added Putin would meet Xi on Thursday.

The Kremlin also confirmed the trip. 

It said this would be Putin’s first foreign trip since he was sworn in as president and began his fifth term in office.

The Foreign Ministry said Xi would discuss with Putin “cooperation in various fields of bilateral relations...as well as international and regional issues of common concern.”

Analysts have said Russia is increasingly dependent on China since the West hit it with sanctions over its military action in Ukraine.

Beijing has hailed its "no limits" partnership as it enjoys access to vast natural resources, including steady gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline. (Xinhua/Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that any attempt to interfere with the legitimate operations of Hong Kong’s Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) would only end up harming the economies of the countries that take such action.

He was speaking after a manager of the government’s ETO in London, Bill Yuen, was arrested with two others on suspicion of breaching Britain's national security law and charged with assisting Hong Kong intelligence officers.

"Any attempt to interfere with the work of the ETOs in different places will be against free trade and free economy, and will be harming the economy of the countries that try to do bad things to the operation of the ETOs," Lee said.

He told reporters that the duties of the trade offices are to liaise with foreign officials, businesses, think tanks and representatives of various sectors, to boost links and promote the economic and trade interests of the SAR.

"Any attempt to make unwarranted allegations against the SAR government is unacceptable," the chief executive said.

"The ETOs will of course pursue their duties full-heartedly and legitimately."

He also noted that the the Chinese Embassy in Britain has made serious representations to UK officials, while the SAR government is still waiting for British authorities to respond to its demand for more information on the allegations.

The Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the SAR has accused Britain of arbitrarily arresting Chinese citizens and slandering the Hong Kong government, saying this violates the principles of international law.

Lee also said a photo of him and Yuen that is circulating online was taken more than two decades ago to mark their graduation from the Australian School of Policing.

The CE said that is the only impression he has of Yuen.]]>

    <![CDATA[Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for better relations with South Korea as he met with his counterpart from Seoul during rare talks in Beijing, Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.

The visit by Cho Tae-yul to the capital on Monday and Tuesday is the first visit by a South Korean foreign minister to Beijing in over six years.

Ties between the two countries "have been facing difficulties and challenges", Wang said, according to Xinhua.

He called for the two sides to "understand and respect each other, strengthen communication and exchanges, eliminate misunderstandings and enhance mutual trust", the Xinhua report stated.

He also hoped that Seoul would "properly and prudently" handle Taiwan-related issues and abide by the one-China policy.

Meanwhile, Cho said better ties were in the common interests of both countries and that Seoul was willing to expand mutual trust, according to Xinhua.

Cho also told Wang their countries should work together and "even if there are difficulties, momentum of cooperation should be continued while carefully managing the relations," according to the South Korean foreign ministry.

He added that they could continue to prepare for a summit of the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan in Seoul, planned for the end of May. The leaders of the three countries last met in China in 2019.

The Chinese statement made no mention of the summit.

Wang and Cho also agreed, according to their ministries, that the economic ties of the two countries had been a force in each other's development, and agreed to strengthen their cooperation, including the ensuring of stable supply chains. (AFP/Reuters)]]>

    Charm offensive as Xi ramps up 'people diplomacy'

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping’s latest trip to Europe was one of the signs that Beijing is ramping up "people-to-people" diplomacy to counter-balance trade tensions, as the president went on a charm offensive to boost economic ties with central and southeast Europe, according to a political commentator.

Speaking after the president wrapped up his visit to France, Serbia and Hungary, Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and the chairman of Asia Narratives, told RTHK that Xi also hoped to show Europe that what China had been doing over the past 10 years - including with the Belt and Road Initiative - "has been all trade and growth".

"Over 50 different agreements were signed between China and these three nations, covering all areas...," he said.

"What he’s doing is definitely people-to-people diplomacy, especially at the higher level, you could see very clearly that he had a very good rapport on a personal level with President Macron, as well as [the] leaders of both Hungary and Serbia, and he actually stayed an extra couple of hours in Serbia," Tangen said.

Xi’s visit to the region, which was the first in five years, came at a critical time amid mounting trade pressure, with the European Union (EU) pressing ahead with investigations into China's critical sectors, including electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, and medical devices - in a bid to ease the bloc’s trade deficit with China.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier told reporters after talks with Xi that the European Union was "ready to make full use of trade defence instruments" to defend European economies, but Tangen rejected this.

"The overcapacity issue [raised] is completely false," Tangen commented. He said that when Europe and America dominated manufacturing worldwide, they attributed it to market competition and the natural superiority of their products.

"Today, as China is able to sell goods and services at a lower rate, all of a sudden it became 'why hasn’t China been watching out for Europe and the US?'" Tangen said.

"The fact is, these are developed dominant countries that cannot fulfil their own needs and desires from their own countries. If they weren't buying from China, they would be buying from somewhere else, [so] it’s not going to address their trade deficit."

"What the EU should really be concerned about is their competitiveness. What is the future of the EU?"

With over half of the world's population heading to vote for new leaders of more than 80 nations over the course of 2024, Tangen expects trade tensions to continue in the short and medium term as policymakers court voters.
 
"Really, communication is absolutely key," Tangen said. "And in the long term it is about people-to-people exchanges. It takes time and you have to be willing to wait and engage."

"Concentrating on sports and education, and bringing young people into the play. And this is a very long-term strategy by the Chinese government."]]>

    <![CDATA[China's inflation rate quickened last month, according to official data released on Saturday.

The consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3 percent year-on-year in April, staying in positive territory for the third straight month, according to the  National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

That compared with a 0.2 percent rise forecast by Bloomberg analysts and was higher than the 0.1 percent increase in March.

"In April, household consumption demand continued to rebound... and the year-on-year increase expanded," the NBS said in a statement.

However, the producer price index sank by 2.5 percent year-on-year, the NBS said. (AFP)]]>
