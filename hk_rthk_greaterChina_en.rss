    <![CDATA[Premier Li Qiang will attend a trilateral summit with the leaders of Japan and South Korea on May 26-27 in Seoul, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.

It'll be the first such meeting in more than four years.

According to the South Korean presidential office, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol will have bilateral talks with Li and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Sunday ahead of their three-way gathering a day later.

The three countries are expected to adopt a joint statement on six areas, including on the economy and trade, following the summit.

In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said China stands ready to work with Japan and South Korea to implement the trilateral cooperation vision for the next decade.

“This summit will be a turning point for Korea, Japan and China to completely restore and normalise three-way cooperation systems,” Kim Tae-hyo, South Korea's deputy national security director, told a news conference in Seoul.

The summit was last held in December 2019 in China before it was suspended because of the pandemic. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[One person was killed and three others were injured in an explosion in a residential building in Harbin, capital of the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.

Local authorities suspect an exploding gas tank caused the blast which occurred at around 7am on Thursday morning in Xiangfang District.

Dashcam footage from a nearby vehicle driving along a highway showed a plume of smoke suddenly appearing, and debris strewn across the road, slowing down surrounding traffic.

The injuries to the three people are not life-threatening.
   
Further investigation into the cause of the explosion is underway. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)]]>

    <![CDATA[The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command on Thursday started joint military drills surrounding Taiwan.

The drills – which began at 7.45am – are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait, the north, south and east of Taiwan Island, as well as areas around the islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu, and Dongyin.
   
Li Xi, theatre command spokesperson, said military services including the army, navy, air force and rocket force of the theatre command are being organised to conduct the joint drills, codenamed Joint Sword-2024A, from Thursday to Friday.

He said the drills focus on joint sea-air combat-readiness patrol, joint seizure of comprehensive battlefield control, and joint precision strikes on key targets.

Li said the drills also serve as a strong punishment for the separatist acts of "Taiwan independence" forces and a stern warning against the interference and provocation by external forces. (Xinhua)]]>

    <![CDATA[China will continue to strengthen strategic cooperation with Iran, safeguard common interests, and make endeavours for regional and world peace, state media reported on Wednesday, citing comments from Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

Wang made the remarks in talks on Tuesday with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahdi Safari, while attending a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

"Iran has lost outstanding leaders and China has lost good friends and partners, said Wang, according to Xinhua News Agency. "In this difficult time, China firmly stands by Iranian friends", he said, referring to the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday.

Safari, for his part, thanked President Xi Jinping and Wang for expressing condolences at the earliest opportunity on the deaths of Raisi and Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and thanked China for its steadfast support for Iran.

He emphasised that Iran's domestic and foreign policies will remain unchanged, and the country will continue to advance the process of national development under the leadership of the supreme leader.

Safari added that Iran attaches great importance to its relationship with China, and is committed to enhancing cooperation in political, economic, cultural and other fields. (Reuters/Xinhua)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Taiwan Affairs Office said the new leader of the Taiwan region, William Lai, sent "a dangerous signal" by seeking "Taiwan independence" and making provocations to undermine cross-strait peace and stability.

Responding to Lai's speech as he took office on Monday, Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Chen Binhua said while the mainstream public aspiration on the island is for peace and development, Lai has ignored the public opinion, exposing his nature of being "a worker for Taiwan independence".

Chen also said Lai sought independence by relying on foreign support.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said "Taiwan independence" is a dead end.

"No matter how the political situation in Taiwan changes, it will not change the historical and legal fact that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one China," Wang said. (Xinhua and agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[Two Chinese warships docked on Sunday at a commercial port in Cambodia in preparation for joint naval exercises between the two countries, with Beijing's ambassador hailing their "ironclad" friendship.

The Jingangshan amphibious warfare ship and Qijiguang training ship sailed in to the Sihanoukville Port, as part of 15 days of land and sea drills involving 760 Chinese military personnel along with around 1,300 Cambodians and 11 Cambodian vessels.

"We are ironclad friends," Chinese ambassador Wang Wentian told reporters on the shore.

“The cooperation between the two armies, between China and Cambodia, is conducive to the security of both countries and the security of the region."

The Jingangshan and the Qijiguang are due to take part in exercises from the Ream Naval Base.

    <![CDATA[Senior Beijing official Xia Baolong highly values Macau's position as an international metropolis and its cooperation with nearby Hengqin, Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng said on Sunday as the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office wrapped up his week-long inspection trip to the gambling hub.

During his visit, Xia met representatives from various sectors, including healthcare, education and technology, to learn more about the latest social and economic developments in the SAR.

Ho said the senior Beijing official described Macau as "the apple of the motherland's eye" and stressed the need to use its advantages to build a "golden business card".

"From my understanding, Director Xia's visit this time is to make an assessment of the current term of the SAR government. It's a great support for our work. They provide suggestions on areas where our work is insufficient," the Macau leader told reporters.

"Regarding our existing problems, they convey what the central government expects from us in meetings with executive, legislative and judicial bodies."

This is Xia's second visit to Macau in as many years and came ahead of the 25th anniversary of the SAR's handover and a new term of government.

Ho said Xia didn't mention the Macau CE election during the visit.

"This time, he emphasised a lot the 'golden business card' of Macau, and he also emphasised that Macau is now an international city, or an international cosmopolitan," Agnes Lam, associate professor at the University of Macau and a former lawmaker, told RTHK.

"I think he didn't mention 'international' that many times last time. I think this is a new emphasis for Macau."

During his trip, Xia visited the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and inspected a number of projects there, and Lam believes it shows the central government wants quicker integration of Macau and Hengqin. 

"I think they urge the progress to be faster. This time, I think Director Xia also visited several key projects, including a residential project named Macau [New] Neighbourhood. And also he asked the whole society to support the government to speed up that project. So I think he also sent a stronger message about we should progress with that project."]]>

    <![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Harbin on Friday to promote trade ties between the two nations on the final day of his state visit in China. 

Lying just a few hundred kilometres from the border with Russia, Harbin has long served as a key hub for cross-border trade and cultural exchange.

The Russian president attended the opening ceremony of a China-Russia trade expo and was accompanied by Vice President Han Zheng.

Speaking at the ceremony, Putin hailed energy ties between the two countries and promised to "strengthen" them.

"Russia is ready and able to continuously power the Chinese economy, businesses, cities and towns with affordable and environmentally clean energy," he said.

"As the world is on the threshold of the next technological revolution, we are determined to consistently deepen bilateral co-operation in the field of high technologies and innovations," he added.

Putin arrived in Beijing on Thursday on his first trip abroad since his March re-election, meeting President Xi Jinping for talks in which the leaders framed their nations' ties as a stabilising force for the world.

The two men later ditched their ties for a less formal meeting over tea at the Zhongnanhai leadership compound. Footage from broadcaster CCTV also showed the leaders embracing.

An editorial in the Global Times newspaper on Friday cited the importance of burgeoning trade ties between the two countries, saying China had been Russia's largest trading partner for 13 straight years. 

"These achievements are not easy and have been achieved by both countries overcoming various external challenges and unfavourable factors, highlighting the solid foundation of the China-Russia relationship," the editorial said. (AFP/Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Beijing on Friday announced some of its most sweeping measures yet to stabilise and revive the country's beleaguered property sector, allowing local governments to buy "some" apartments, relaxing mortgage rules and pledging further efforts to deliver unfinished homes.

Earlier, fresh data showed the fastest drop in new home prices in more than nine years, highlighted continued problems for an industry which at its peak accounted for a fifth of economic activity and remains a major drag on confidence and growth.

Vice Premier He Lifeng told an online meeting with other authorities that municipal governments could buy homes at "reasonable" prices.

The homes would be used to provide affordable housing, He said. 

The vice premier also said local governments could repurchase land sold to developers, and promised authorities would "fight hard" to complete stalled projects.

Separately, the People's Bank of China said it would further lower mortgage interest rates and down-payment requirements.

Shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers soared following the announcement. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition on Friday seeking the liquidation of Chinese property giant Country Garden. 

The decision provides some relief to the embattled developer amid Beijing's efforts to revive the crisis-hit property sector.

A Hong Kong firm filed the petition against Country Garden in February for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. The developer defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds last year and is in the process of an offshore debt restructuring.

Country Garden applied for the adjournment to prepare more evidence. The request was not opposed by the petitioner which filed the action against the company.

If Country Garden is able to present progress on the debt restructuring talks with its offshore creditors, it would help the developer push back against the liquidation petition.

A key group of creditors, the ad hoc group of bondholders, have signalled their "neutral stance" towards the liquidation petition, according to the petitioner's lawyer. 

In a letter to the court, the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing the ad hoc group, said they no longer intended to appear in the court.

The hearing into the petition comes against the backdrop of Beijing stepping up efforts to revive the property sector, which slipped into an unprecedented debt crisis in mid-2021.

Over the past few years, a growing list of developers has defaulted on debt repayment obligations and a handful of them, including China Evergrande, have been ordered to be liquidated. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Russian President, Vladimir Putin, was on Friday wrapping up his two-day state visit to China with a trip to the northeastern city of Harbin, which has historic ties with Russia.

He will join trade and investment talks there a day after a meeting in Beijing with President Xi Jinping, who told him that China-Russia relations should be "cherished and cared for" by both sides. 

The two also discussed the conflict in Ukraine, with Putin saying he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine.

And hours after Xi and Putin met, US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said that China could not "have its cake and eat it too" with regard to the West and Moscow. 

"It can't have it both ways and want to have [better] relationships with Europe and other countries while simultaneously continuing to fuel the biggest threat to European security in a long time," Patel said, referring to the Ukraine conflict.

Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme, Alan Lung, a political analyst and Co-convenor (International) of the Path of Democracy think tank, said he believes that China is looking to play a mediating role in the Ukraine conflict.

"There are only two countries in the world that doesn't need another country and that is the US and Russia because of its vast territory, but China cannot do that," he said.

"China has bigger stakes and has to cooperate with the West, and this is why China, I think Xi Jinping, desperately wants to, if possible, broker peace in Ukraine on behalf of Russia, on behalf of the Europeans."

On the same programme, Brian Yeung, who wrote a book on his time working in Russia, said he thinks China would not want the situation in Ukraine to undermine its ties with Europe.

"China might be the only, or at least the most important strategic partner to Russia," he said.

"Recently, Xi Jinping also visited Europe and had a very fruitful conversation with the French president. That also signals that China doesn't really want to mess up with Europe for the sake of the China-Russia relationship."

Xin Zhang, an associate professor at the School of Politics and International Relations at East China Normal University, said there are mixed opinions over the ongoing conflict, with some supporting Russia's narrative that the military operation is justified.

"There are also those who are very much on the pro-Ukraine side, looking at this as essentially a big power exploiting a small neighbouring power," he said.

"The situation is complicated. There was a long, complicated historical cause for this conflict to escalate to such a degree. I try to emphasise that China is not the direct party in the conflict, and we would love to see a peaceful resolution through political negotiation."]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping has pledged to work with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to "rejuvenate" their countries as the pair started a day of talks in Beijing.

Putin, for his part, said he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine, adding that he would brief Xi on the situation there.

“China hopes for the early return of Europe to peace and stability and will continue to play a constructive role toward this,” Xi said, speaking alongside Putin.

Beijing last year offered a broad plan for peace outlining general principles for ending the war in Ukraine.

The two leaders also signed a joint statement on deepening China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership marking the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties.

"The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it," Xi said.

"China is willing to... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world."

Xi added that the two countries will continue to uphold a position of non-alliance and non-confrontation.

The Russian leader told Xi that their co-operation was a stabilising factor.

"It is of crucial significance that relations between Russia and China are not opportunistic and are not directed against anyone," Russia's RIA Novosti news agency cited Putin as saying.

Putin on Thursday began a two-day state visit to China that will include detailed talks on Ukraine, Asia, energy and trade with Xi.

Putin will also meet with Premier Li Qiang and visit the northeastern city of Harbin. (Agencies)]]>

"China is ready to work together with Russia to achieve development and rejuvenation of our countries and uphold world equality and justice."

Putin is in China for a two-day state visit. He was greeted by officials and an honour guard as he got off his plane in Beijing in the small hours of Thursday.

Later in the morning, Xi held a welcome ceremony for Putin at the square outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People.

During their meeting, Putin said: "Russia-China cooperation is not directed against any other power and is a stabilising factor for the world."

This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election, and the second in just over six months to China.

Before his visit, Putin, in an interview with Xinhua News Agency, had praised Xi for helping to build a strategic partnership between Beijing and Moscow based on national interests and deep mutual trust.

On Ukraine, Putin said: “We are open to a dialogue on Ukraine, but such negotiations must take into account the interests of all countries involved in the conflict, including ours.”

“We are seeking a comprehensive, sustainable and just settlement of this conflict through peaceful means."

China has been involved in efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Beijing's "genuine desire" to help resolve the Ukraine crisis, in an interview with Chinese state media published on Wednesday ahead of a two-day visit to the country.

Putin arrives in Beijing on Thursday to meet his "dear friend" Xi Jinping, seeking to win greater support from China for his war effort in Ukraine and isolated economy.

The visit, in which he will also travel to the northeastern city of Harbin for a trade and investment expo, is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and his second in just over six months to China.

"We commend China's approaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine," Putin told the Xinhua state news agency in a Moscow interview, which was also carried in English on the Kremlin website.

"Beijing is well aware of its root causes and global geopolitical significance," Putin said, referring to a 12-point position paper published by China in February 2023 on reaching a political settlement to the crisis.

"The ideas and proposals contained in the document show the genuine desire of our Chinese friends to help stabilise the situation," Putin said. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said China is gravely concerned about the prosecution in the UK of three people allegedly working for Hong Kong's intelligence service, and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the country.

“For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.

“China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.”

Britain on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to the UK to state that espionage and cyberattacks were not acceptable on its soil.

The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ambassador Zheng Zeguang had been called to a meeting to be told that “the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyberattacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.”

The Chinese Embassy in London accused Britain of fabricating the charges against the three men.

Zheng said the UK should not interfere in Hong Kong and China's affairs, and should stop making anti-China political provocations.

He also said Britain should not provide refuge to wanted criminals. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[China has spoken out against a move by the United States to hike tariffs on US$18 billion worth of Chinese imports such as electric vehicles (EVs), advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment.

The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminium and more. 

The tariff rate on EVs is set to quadruple to 100 percent this year, the White House said.

Tariffs for semiconductors, meanwhile, will double from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year.

The action is aimed at encouraging China to "eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation," the White House said in a statement.

In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China is opposed to the US tariff hikes and would take measures to defend its interests, urging Washington to cancel the measures.

The Foreign Ministry said it's against unilateral tariff hikes in violation of World Trade Organisation rules.

China "will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests", spokesman Wang Wenbin said.

Xinhua News Agency described it as "a protectionist move widely believed to imperil the American ambition to enhance competitiveness and slash carbon emissions".

The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between US President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin would make a two-day state visit to China from May 16 to 17.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced that Putin was coming at the invitation of President Xi Jinping.

The ministry added Putin would meet Xi on Thursday.

The Kremlin also confirmed the trip. 

It said this would be Putin’s first foreign trip since he was sworn in as president and began his fifth term in office.

The Foreign Ministry said Xi would discuss with Putin “cooperation in various fields of bilateral relations...as well as international and regional issues of common concern.”

Analysts have said Russia is increasingly dependent on China since the West hit it with sanctions over its military action in Ukraine.

Beijing has hailed its "no limits" partnership as it enjoys access to vast natural resources, including steady gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline. (Xinhua/Agencies)]]>
