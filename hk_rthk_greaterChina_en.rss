    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping has pledged to work with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to "rejuvenate" their countries as the pair started a day of talks in Beijing.

Putin, for his part, said he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine, adding that he would brief Xi on the situation there.

“China hopes for the early return of Europe to peace and stability and will continue to play a constructive role toward this,” Xi said, speaking alongside Putin.

Beijing last year offered a broad plan for peace outlining general principles for ending the war in Ukraine.

The two leaders also signed a joint statement on deepening China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership marking the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties.

"The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it," Xi said.

"China is willing to... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world."

Xi added that the two countries will continue to uphold a position of non-alliance and non-confrontation.

The Russian leader told Xi that their co-operation was a stabilising factor.

"It is of crucial significance that relations between Russia and China are not opportunistic and are not directed against anyone," Russia's RIA Novosti news agency cited Putin as saying.

Putin on Thursday began a two-day state visit to China that will include detailed talks on Ukraine, Asia, energy and trade with Xi.

Putin will also meet with Premier Li Qiang and visit the northeastern city of Harbin. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping told Russian President Vladimir Putin that China-Russia relations today have not come easily and should be cherished and cared for by both sides, state media said on Thursday.

Xi made the remarks when the two leaders met in Beijing, where he said China will be a good neighbour to Russia.

"On this new journey, China will always be a good neighbour, friend and partner of mutual trust with Russia, and further consolidate the friendship of the people of the two countries," he said.

"China is ready to work together with Russia to achieve development and rejuvenation of our countries and uphold world equality and justice."

Putin is in China for a two-day state visit. He was greeted by officials and an honour guard as he got off his plane in Beijing in the small hours of Thursday.

Later in the morning, Xi held a welcome ceremony for Putin at the square outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People.

During their meeting, Putin said: "Russia-China cooperation is not directed against any other power and is a stabilising factor for the world."

This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election, and the second in just over six months to China.

Before his visit, Putin, in an interview with Xinhua News Agency, had praised Xi for helping to build a strategic partnership between Beijing and Moscow based on national interests and deep mutual trust.

On Ukraine, Putin said: “We are open to a dialogue on Ukraine, but such negotiations must take into account the interests of all countries involved in the conflict, including ours.”

“We are seeking a comprehensive, sustainable and just settlement of this conflict through peaceful means."

China has been involved in efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Beijing's "genuine desire" to help resolve the Ukraine crisis, in an interview with Chinese state media published on Wednesday ahead of a two-day visit to the country.

Putin arrives in Beijing on Thursday to meet his "dear friend" Xi Jinping, seeking to win greater support from China for his war effort in Ukraine and isolated economy.

The visit, in which he will also travel to the northeastern city of Harbin for a trade and investment expo, is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and his second in just over six months to China.

"We commend China's approaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine," Putin told the Xinhua state news agency in a Moscow interview, which was also carried in English on the Kremlin website.

"Beijing is well aware of its root causes and global geopolitical significance," Putin said, referring to a 12-point position paper published by China in February 2023 on reaching a political settlement to the crisis.

"The ideas and proposals contained in the document show the genuine desire of our Chinese friends to help stabilise the situation," Putin said. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said China is gravely concerned about the prosecution in the UK of three people allegedly working for Hong Kong's intelligence service, and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the country.

“For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.

“China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.”

Britain on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to the UK to state that espionage and cyberattacks were not acceptable on its soil.

The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ambassador Zheng Zeguang had been called to a meeting to be told that “the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyberattacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.”

The Chinese Embassy in London accused Britain of fabricating the charges against the three men.

Zheng said the UK should not interfere in Hong Kong and China's affairs, and should stop making anti-China political provocations.

He also said Britain should not provide refuge to wanted criminals. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[China has spoken out against a move by the United States to hike tariffs on US$18 billion worth of Chinese imports such as electric vehicles (EVs), advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment.

The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminium and more. 

The tariff rate on EVs is set to quadruple to 100 percent this year, the White House said.

Tariffs for semiconductors, meanwhile, will double from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year.

The action is aimed at encouraging China to "eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation," the White House said in a statement.

In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China is opposed to the US tariff hikes and would take measures to defend its interests, urging Washington to cancel the measures.

The Foreign Ministry said it's against unilateral tariff hikes in violation of World Trade Organisation rules.

China "will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests", spokesman Wang Wenbin said.

Xinhua News Agency described it as "a protectionist move widely believed to imperil the American ambition to enhance competitiveness and slash carbon emissions".

The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between US President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin would make a two-day state visit to China from May 16 to 17.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced that Putin was coming at the invitation of President Xi Jinping.

The ministry added Putin would meet Xi on Thursday.

The Kremlin also confirmed the trip. 

It said this would be Putin’s first foreign trip since he was sworn in as president and began his fifth term in office.

The Foreign Ministry said Xi would discuss with Putin “cooperation in various fields of bilateral relations...as well as international and regional issues of common concern.”

Analysts have said Russia is increasingly dependent on China since the West hit it with sanctions over its military action in Ukraine.

Beijing has hailed its "no limits" partnership as it enjoys access to vast natural resources, including steady gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline. (Xinhua/Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that any attempt to interfere with the legitimate operations of Hong Kong’s Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) would only end up harming the economies of the countries that take such action.

He was speaking after a manager of the government’s ETO in London, Bill Yuen, was arrested with two others on suspicion of breaching Britain's national security law and charged with assisting Hong Kong intelligence officers.

"Any attempt to interfere with the work of the ETOs in different places will be against free trade and free economy, and will be harming the economy of the countries that try to do bad things to the operation of the ETOs," Lee said.

He told reporters that the duties of the trade offices are to liaise with foreign officials, businesses, think tanks and representatives of various sectors, to boost links and promote the economic and trade interests of the SAR.

"Any attempt to make unwarranted allegations against the SAR government is unacceptable," the chief executive said.

"The ETOs will of course pursue their duties full-heartedly and legitimately."

He also noted that the the Chinese Embassy in Britain has made serious representations to UK officials, while the SAR government is still waiting for British authorities to respond to its demand for more information on the allegations.

The Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the SAR has accused Britain of arbitrarily arresting Chinese citizens and slandering the Hong Kong government, saying this violates the principles of international law.

Lee also said a photo of him and Yuen that is circulating online was taken more than two decades ago to mark their graduation from the Australian School of Policing.

The CE said that is the only impression he has of Yuen.]]>

    <![CDATA[Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for better relations with South Korea as he met with his counterpart from Seoul during rare talks in Beijing, Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.

The visit by Cho Tae-yul to the capital on Monday and Tuesday is the first visit by a South Korean foreign minister to Beijing in over six years.

Ties between the two countries "have been facing difficulties and challenges", Wang said, according to Xinhua.

He called for the two sides to "understand and respect each other, strengthen communication and exchanges, eliminate misunderstandings and enhance mutual trust", the Xinhua report stated.

He also hoped that Seoul would "properly and prudently" handle Taiwan-related issues and abide by the one-China policy.

Meanwhile, Cho said better ties were in the common interests of both countries and that Seoul was willing to expand mutual trust, according to Xinhua.

Cho also told Wang their countries should work together and "even if there are difficulties, momentum of cooperation should be continued while carefully managing the relations," according to the South Korean foreign ministry.

He added that they could continue to prepare for a summit of the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan in Seoul, planned for the end of May. The leaders of the three countries last met in China in 2019.

The Chinese statement made no mention of the summit.

Wang and Cho also agreed, according to their ministries, that the economic ties of the two countries had been a force in each other's development, and agreed to strengthen their cooperation, including the ensuring of stable supply chains. (AFP/Reuters)]]>

    Charm offensive as Xi ramps up 'people diplomacy'

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping’s latest trip to Europe was one of the signs that Beijing is ramping up "people-to-people" diplomacy to counter-balance trade tensions, as the president went on a charm offensive to boost economic ties with central and southeast Europe, according to a political commentator.

Speaking after the president wrapped up his visit to France, Serbia and Hungary, Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and the chairman of Asia Narratives, told RTHK that Xi also hoped to show Europe that what China had been doing over the past 10 years - including with the Belt and Road Initiative - "has been all trade and growth".

"Over 50 different agreements were signed between China and these three nations, covering all areas...," he said.

"What he’s doing is definitely people-to-people diplomacy, especially at the higher level, you could see very clearly that he had a very good rapport on a personal level with President Macron, as well as [the] leaders of both Hungary and Serbia, and he actually stayed an extra couple of hours in Serbia," Tangen said.

Xi’s visit to the region, which was the first in five years, came at a critical time amid mounting trade pressure, with the European Union (EU) pressing ahead with investigations into China's critical sectors, including electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, and medical devices - in a bid to ease the bloc’s trade deficit with China.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier told reporters after talks with Xi that the European Union was "ready to make full use of trade defence instruments" to defend European economies, but Tangen rejected this.

"The overcapacity issue [raised] is completely false," Tangen commented. He said that when Europe and America dominated manufacturing worldwide, they attributed it to market competition and the natural superiority of their products.

"Today, as China is able to sell goods and services at a lower rate, all of a sudden it became 'why hasn’t China been watching out for Europe and the US?'" Tangen said.

"The fact is, these are developed dominant countries that cannot fulfil their own needs and desires from their own countries. If they weren't buying from China, they would be buying from somewhere else, [so] it’s not going to address their trade deficit."

"What the EU should really be concerned about is their competitiveness. What is the future of the EU?"

With over half of the world's population heading to vote for new leaders of more than 80 nations over the course of 2024, Tangen expects trade tensions to continue in the short and medium term as policymakers court voters.
 
"Really, communication is absolutely key," Tangen said. "And in the long term it is about people-to-people exchanges. It takes time and you have to be willing to wait and engage."

"Concentrating on sports and education, and bringing young people into the play. And this is a very long-term strategy by the Chinese government."]]>

That compared with a 0.2 percent rise forecast by Bloomberg analysts and was higher than the 0.1 percent increase in March.

"In April, household consumption demand continued to rebound... and the year-on-year increase expanded," the NBS said in a statement.

However, the producer price index sank by 2.5 percent year-on-year, the NBS said. (AFP)]]>

Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, met Xia in Beijing on Thursday, to brief him on Hong Kong’s efforts in attracting strategic I&T enterprises and talent, as well as the city’s latest developments in areas like digital economy.
 
Xia said the SAR government's work deserves full recognition, and that Beijing will continue to support Hong Kong.

Sun, for his part, said the SAR administration will "live up to its mission" and continue strengthening I&T co-operation with different mainland cities.

Separately, Xia also met with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung, and expressed the need for Hong Kong to continue developing the tourism sector. 

Having experienced profound changes in both the internal and external environment, he said the city's travel industry needs to identify new ways to boost growth. 

The HKMAO chief added that the SAR should adopt the strategy of "tourism everywhere", and develop new routes and products to consolidate Hong Kong's reputation as the best travel destination.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Commerce Ministry on Wednesday said it firmly opposes the US withdrawing export licences to telecommunications equipment maker Huawei, as it also vowed to take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interest of Chinese firms.

The remarks came after the US Commerce Department on Tuesday confirmed that it has revoked some export licences related to Huawei.

Earlier, a Reuters report, citing sources, noted that the US government has withdrawn special licences that allows chip suppliers Qualcomm and Intel to sell order-generation semiconductors to Huawei for use in its laptops and handsets.

Beijing called the move by Washington “a typical practice of economic coercion” and a “violation to its commitment to not decouple from China”.

“The US has generalised the concept of national security, politicised economic and trade issues, abused export control measures, and repeatedly imposed unreasonable sanctions and repression on specific Chinese firms. China is firmly opposed to this,” a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in response to media inquiry on the reported cancellation.

“It not only violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, but also severely harms the interests of US companies. What the US has done has significantly violated its commitment,” the spokesperson added, citing that these actions are also in stark contrast to the US claim of “precisely defining national security”.

Huawei did not immediately comment on the decision by the US Commerce Department.

The cancellations came after the release last month of Huawei’s first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro, powered by Intel’s new Core Ultra9 processor.

The company was placed on a US trade restriction list in 2019 amid spying concerns.]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that a free trade agreement between China and Serbia will take effect on July 1.

It is one of six measures announced by the president to support the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future, as he met the press with his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic, after they held talks in Belgrade.

Serbia is the first European country to build such a community with China.

Among the other measures announced by Xi, there will be more direct flights between Belgrade and Shanghai and airlines will be encouraged to launch direct flights between Belgrade and Guangzhou, and China is ready to import more high-quality agricultural products from Serbia.

"It is a strategic choice made by both sides to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. Its goal is to realise the aspiration of the two peoples for a better life. Its foundation and driving force come from the firm support and extensive participation of the two peoples," Xi said in a joint press conference with Vucic.

Vucic called Xi an “ironclad” friend and said his visit to Serbia is “historic” because it opens the path for even closer ties.

In a joint statement, the two countries said they decided to deepen and elevate the China-Serbia comprehensive strategic partnership.

Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday night on the second leg of his European tour.

The visit comes on the anniversary of the Nato bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 1999 during a campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The bombing killed three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 Chinese nationals.

"The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself," Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday. (Xinhua and agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping on Wednesday held talks with his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic on the second leg of his European tour.

Xi said his visit to Serbia will open a new chapter in bilateral ties.

The president was greeted by Vucic outside the main government offices in central Belgrade.

Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday evening from France.

Later on Wednesday, Xi will head to Hungary for a state visit marking 75 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries.

In an article published in the Hungarian newspaper Magyar Nemzet, he noted that the upcoming visit would be his second to Hungary in 15 years.

The president wrote that the two countries stood together in solidarity over the years amid challenges such as the global financial crisis and Covid-19.

"Over the past 75 years, China and Hungary have remained good partners for win-win cooperation. Focusing on high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, our two countries are strengthening synergy in development strategies and deepening results-oriented cooperation in such areas as investment, infrastructure, finance, new energy, and telecommunication technology," the article read.

"Our bilateral cooperation is strong, fruitful, and dynamic."

Xi stressed the need for Beijing and Budapest to further boost friendship and cooperation and to expand cultural and people-to-people exchanges. (Xinhua and agencies)]]>

    Xi Jinping arrives in Serbia after lunch with Macron

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday evening, after French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a high altitude lunch at a childhood haunt in the Pyrenees mountains for the Chinese leader.

On the next step in his European tour, Xi will hold talks with President Aleksandar Vucic in Serbia, where China has invested heavily to expand its economic footprint.

Serbian state broadcaster RTS showed Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan descend from their Air China aeroplane to be greeted by Vucic, with a small crowd of welcomers waiting along a red carpet dressed in traditional clothing and holding flags and flowers.

"China and Serbia enjoy profound traditional friendship. Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations," Xi said in a written statement issued by Xinhua news agency upon his arrival.

Xi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to have in-depth exchange of views with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on bilateral relationship and other issues of mutual interest.

"I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations," he said. 

In France, Macron pressed a message to Beijing not to support Russia's war against Ukraine and to accept fairer trade.

But the other two countries chosen by Xi for his first trip to Europe since 2019 – Hungary is his final stop after Serbia – are seen as among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.

The first day of Xi's state visit to France saw respectful but sometimes robust exchanges between the two presidents during a succession of talks on Monday.

Macron, joined initially by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, urged Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its war with Ukraine and asked Beijing to do all it could to end the conflict.

Xi, for his part, warned the West not to "smear" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.

China has poured billions into Serbia and neighbouring Balkan countries, and last year Beijing and Belgrade signed a free trade agreement.

Serbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told the RTS broadcaster that talks on Wednesday would centre on "a great project." (Xinhua/AFP)]]>
