    Moves to boost mainland business, skilled staff travel

    <![CDATA[The central government on Sunday announced measures to facilitate visits by mainland business representatives and skilled workers to Hong Kong.

According to the National Immigration Administration, mainland residents holding Business Visit Endorsements will be permitted to stay in Hong Kong for up to 14 days, starting from May 6.

Mainlanders who wish to travel to Hong Kong for business purposes are required to obtain an exit endorsement for business visit from the mainland authorities, and at the moment they're allowed to stay here for up to one week.

The authorities also announced that mainland residents can apply for the travel document at any relevant offices across the country, regardless of the applicant's place of household registration or place of residence.

Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing, Wang Ling from the National Immigration Administration said the change can benefit more than 100 million business entities across the country.

"This change aims to better meet the needs of long-term business activity and to support business professionals in seeking opportunities and conducting in-depth business negotiations. According to our preliminary estimates, the new policy is expected to benefit over 100 million businesses and more than 30,000 enterprises and institutions that have registered and applied for multiple Business Visit Endorsements," she added. 

Officials also said they will extend the multiple-entry visas for skilled workers to visit Hong Kong and Macau which currently applies only to Greater Bay Area residents.

From May 6, eligible talent from Beijing and Shanghai will too be able to apply for the visa to visit the two SARs, with each stay limited to 30 days.

Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun thanked the central government for the new measures, saying they would help the SAR to attract talent.

"The two new measures will facilitate Hong Kong's further integration into the national development and achieve concrete results on the solid policy foundation of facilitating the 'southbound and northbound' two-way flow of talents," a government spokesperson added in a statement. 

The spokesperson also said the SAR government will continue to promote talent exchange with the mainland authorities, to create a stronger drive for growth in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area.

Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said the scheme involving skilled workers may be extended to more mainland cities in future.

"It depends on the implementation. We have the potential to have these arrangements further expanded to other cities, especially those cities with closer business connections with Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area," she told RTHK.

"I think the central government will look at the actual situation and decide whether to expand or not."

Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who's also general manager of the artificial intelligence firm SenseTime Hong Kong, said the new measures would enhance the SAR's competitiveness.

"Singapore already provides visa-free to mainland China, right?... Hong Kong needs to be more attractive. So, today the scheme has some benefits for Beijing and Shanghai citizens. That's good for Hong Kong," he said.

Shang added that the new measures would make it more convenient to do business in Hong Kong, as mainland business travellers are allowed to stay longer in the city.

    <![CDATA[Drivers in mainland China who trade in an old car for a newer model are eligible for a subsidy of up to 10,000 yuan (HK$10,800), the commerce ministry has announced.

China is the world's biggest market for cars, and the most competitive in the electric vehicle sector, with more than 100 homegrown companies racing to make the clean car of the future.

To boost demand, Beijing is offering the subsidy to drivers who trade in an electric or hybrid vehicle registered before 2018, or a gasoline-powered car that doesn't meet certain national emissions standards.

Those who replace a vehicle purchased after 2018 will be eligible for a subsidy of 7,000 yuan, the commerce ministry said in a statement.

The measure, in force until the end of the year, applies to all purchases of new electric or hybrid vehicles.

Its announcement coincides with the China Auto Show, where Chinese brands are stealing the show from foreign manufacturers struggling to make the transition to electric vehicles. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping said there was reason for optimism in the development of China-US relations as he met America's top diplomat in Beijing on Friday.

According to state media, the president told Antony Blinken that progress had been made over the past few months in stabilising ties between the two countries.

Xi said the two nations should be "partners, not rivals", and should seek common ground while reserving differences and avoid descending into vicious competition, adding: "there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved, and there is still room for further efforts."

The president also said that "China would be pleased to see a confident and open, prosperous and developing United States".

"We hope the US can also take a positive view of China's development," he added.

"When this fundamental problem is solved... relations can truly stabilise, get better, and move forward." (Reuters/AFP)]]>

    ByteDance says 'no plans' to sell TikTok

    <![CDATA[Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok after a new US law put it on a deadline to divest from the hugely popular video platform or have it banned in the United States.

Tech publication, The Information, earlier reported that ByteDance is exploring scenarios for selling TikTok's US business without the algorithm that recommends videos to TikTok users. ByteDance denied it was considering a sale.

"Foreign media reports about ByteDance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue," the company posted on Thursday on Toutiao, a Chinese-language platform it owns.

"ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok."

TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew said on Wednesday the social media company expects to win a legal challenge to block legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden that he said would ban its popular short video app used by 170 million Americans.

The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the US Senate on Tuesday, is driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or use the app for surveillance.

Biden's signing sets a January 19 deadline for a sale – one day before his term is poised to expire – but he could extend the deadline by three months if he determines privately owned ByteDance is making progress. (AFP/Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for talks across a range of complex issues.

The top US diplomat is due to spend several hours with Wang across closed-door meetings at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse and a working lunch as the two sides try to maintain progress in ties.

As the pair settled into their opening session, Wang told Blinken that the "great ship" of the China-US relationship had stabilised, "but negative factors in the relationship are still increasing and building".

"And the relationship is facing all kinds of disruptions. China’s legitimate development rights have been unreasonably suppressed and our core interests are facing challenges," he said.

Blinken replied that "active diplomacy" was needed to move forward with the agenda set by President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden when they met in San Francisco in November.

"There's no substitute in our judgement for face-to-face diplomacy," Blinken said, adding that he wanted to ensure that "we’re as clear as possible about the areas where we have differences, at the very least to avoid misunderstandings, to avoid miscalculations".

US State Department officials signalled ahead of the sessions that China's support for Russia would feature strongly, saying that Washington is prepared to act against Chinese companies that have been helping retool and resupply Russia's defence industry.

Chinese officials and state media have cast doubt over the extent of possible progress on several fronts, with a China Daily editorial saying that both sides "have been largely talking past each other".

"On the conflict in Ukraine, the world can see it clearly that the Ukraine issue is not an issue between China and the US; and the US side should not turn it into one," it said. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[The nation's latest Shenzhou-18 manned space mission blasted off on Thursday, with three astronauts making their way to the Tiangong space station in the early hours of Friday. 

The rocket, carrying astronauts Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu, took off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in the northwest province of Gansu at 8.59pm. Xinhua reported that the crew completed their docking at about 3.30am and were able to board a couple of hours later.

Zou Lipeng, the centre's director, declared the launch mission a complete success.

"The Long March-2F Y18 rocket has sent Shenzhou-18 manned spaceship to the intended orbit accurately... I hereby announce that Shenzhou-18 has been launched successfully," he said.

The trio will stay in orbit for six months, during which they will carry out more than 90 experiments in the fields of basic physics in microgravity, space material and life science, space medicine and space technology.

They will create an "aquarium" and raise zebrafish and algae in zero gravity, to study how the space environment affects their growth and the aquatic ecosystem.

The crew will also cultivate plants in an experiment to help with designing crops that adapt to outer space conditions. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday called on China and the United States to manage their relationship "responsibly" as he went on a charm offensive in Shanghai, ahead of talks with top central government officials in Beijing.

Blinken's visit to Shanghai has seen him sample local food, watch a basketball game and stroll along the city's famous Bund promenade.

In a meeting with Chen Jining, Communist Party Secretary of Shanghai, America's top diplomat said US President Joe Biden was committed to "direct and sustained" dialogue between the world's two largest economies after years of mounting tension.

"We have an obligation for our people, indeed an obligation to the world, to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly," Blinken said.

“That is the obligation we have, and one that we take very seriously.”

Chen too stressed the need to build stable ties.

"Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries and the future of humanity," he said.

Blinken on Thursday also met students at the Shanghai campus of New York University, where he voiced hope for more Americans to study in China.

He added that the US was committed to welcoming Chinese students.

Blinken also met American business leaders in Shanghai.

He then headed for Beijing, where he's expected to meet Foreign Minister Wang Yi and possibly President Xi Jinping on Friday. (AFP & agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is due to meet business leaders in Shanghai on Thursday, the second day of a three-day visit to China.

Blinken is due to wrap up his visit in Beijing on Friday, with talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and possibly President Xi Jinping. 

Despite an increase in contacts between China and the US recently - including a summit between President Xi and President Joe Biden - a Shanghai-based expert says he's pessimistic about the future of relations between the two countries. 

"I remain a pessimist. I've been a pessimist on US-China relations since the Alaska meetings that took place shortly after Biden took office. I was hopeful that we would see a significant improvement after the Trump years," Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics at East China Normal University, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme. 

"I'm very concerned that Trump may be re-elected. I think a lot of people in the world are concerned about that. But whether he's re-elected or not, you know, if Biden is re-elected or Trump, I think we all anticipate that things are going to continue to get worse," he added. 

However, Mahoney stressed there were some areas where both countries must work together - in their own best interests.

"It's clear that they have to cooperate on some very basic issues," he said. 

These included the global financial system "because both countries depend on that substantially, not only for their own bilateral trade, but for the global trade system as a whole", he said. 

"If China doesn't go along with the dollar or the way that the system works from the US point of view, then that threatens the US economy as well. So there is some shared concern there. We've also heard reports that they might be discussing other issues that won't be well-publicised, perhaps including militarisation in space," Mahoney said. 

He said issues like climate change and increased cooperation seem to have "slipped far from the conversation, despite it being a growing existential concern" for both sides.]]>

    <![CDATA[US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in China for a three-day visit as the two countries try to keep relations on an even keel amid differences.

Blinken landed in Shanghai on Wednesday afternoon where he will meet students and business leaders. He'll later head to Beijing and hold talks with top Chinese officials there.

The two sides are expected to discuss issues such as Ukraine, regional peace and stability, and fentanyl.

This is Blinken's second visit to China in less than a year, following up on recent phone talks between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden.

Xinhua News Agency noted that bilateral ties have begun to stabilise since the two leaders met in San Francisco last November, with significant exchanges in various fields.

"China remains committed to open dialogue and communication with the United States. However, Washington must recognise that dialogue must be based on equality and respect, and actions must align with words," Xinhua said. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[China has condemned the latest package of US military assistance to Taiwan.

The US Senate on Tuesday passed US$95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The package included US$8 billion for the island.

In Beijing, the Taiwan Affairs Office said the aid seriously violates US commitments to China and sends a wrong signal to the "Taiwan independence" separatist forces.

“The Taiwan issue is purely China’s internal affair and does not tolerate any external interference," spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian said.

The Foreign Ministry said US military support for the island only increased the risk of conflict in the Taiwan Strait.

"I'd like to emphasise that the United States and Taiwan strengthening military ties will not bring about security for Taiwan," spokesman Wang Wenbin said. 

"It will only increase tensions and the risk of conflict across the Taiwan Strait, and will ultimately be an act of shooting oneself in the foot." (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[The city will soon learn the results of a national astronaut selection drive, which includes two positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau.

Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of China Manned Space Agency, said on Wednesday the selection of payload specialists in the two SARs has been "essentially completed".

“With the central government's approval, we selected payload experts in Hong Kong and Macau for the first time in the fourth batch of preparatory astronauts selected, and relevant information will be officially released soon,” Lin said.

“As for the specific selection results for Hong Kong and Macau, we will inform the SAR governments at the earliest opportunity.”

The new batch will work with other active astronauts to carry out the follow-up space station missions and achieve China's landing on the moon.

Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said earlier several Hongkongers have made it to the final round of selection to join the nation’s space programme. 

They were among more than 100 people who signed up for the recruitment drive after the agency announced in 2022 that it was recruiting 12 to 14 reserve astronauts for space missions, with two payload specialist positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau for the first time.

Lin’s remarks came as the China Manned Space Agency announced the launch of the Shenzhou-18 spacecraft on Thursday evening.]]>

    <![CDATA[The China Manned Space Agency on Wednesday introduced the crew for the Shenzhou-18 mission, the latest in a programme that aims to send astronauts to the Moon by 2030. 

The trio of astronauts will be led by Ye Guangfu, a fighter pilot and veteran astronaut who took part in the Shenzhou-13 mission in 2021. 

Ye, along with Li Cong and Li Guangsu are scheduled to blast off at 8.59pm local time on Thursday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. They will relieve the Shenzhou-17 team who are currently on the Tiangong space station.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference in Jiuquan, Ye said the mission will be a special one. 

"It's a very special time and also carries special meaning. During the mission this time in China's space station, we will celebrate China's 75th anniversary of its founding and today is also China's ninth Space Day."

Ye also stressed that China believes in international collaboration when it comes to space exploration.

"For us, we all actually pursue our dream to establish a space station, explore space, and also to make contributions. I believe we'll make great contributions to build a community of shared future for mankind.

"We also sincerely invite our international peers to explore the vast universe together and to create a better future for mankind with joint efforts, and a China space station you can always look up to."

The Tiangong is the crown jewel of Beijing's space programme – which has also landed robotic rovers on Mars and the Moon – and made China the third country to put humans in orbit.

It is constantly crewed by rotating teams of three astronauts.

The new crew will replace the Shenzhou-17 team, who were sent to the station in October, and stay in orbit for six months.

The Shenzhou-17 crew is scheduled to return to Earth on April 30. (Additional reporting by AFP and Xinhua)]]>

    <![CDATA[The US Senate voted late on Tuesday by a wide margin to send legislation to President Joe Biden that would require Chinese owner ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations within about nine months or face a ban.

The measure was passed by the US House of Representatives on Saturday and Biden said he would sign it into law on Wednesday.

TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing, has argued the law amounts to a ban that would violate the US free speech rights of its users.

The company did not immediately comment but over the weekend, it told its employees that it would quickly go to court to try to block the legislation.

"We'll continue to fight, as this legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok... This is the beginning, not the end of this long process," TikTok told employees on Saturday.

The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favour of the bill.

In 2020, then-President Donald Trump was blocked by the courts in his bid to block TikTok and WeChat in the United States.

The new legislation, however, is likely to give the Biden administration stronger legal footing to ban TikTok if ByteDance fails to divest the app, experts say. It also gives the White House new tools to ban or force the sale of other foreign-owned apps it deems to be security threats. 

China has described the proposed US ban on TikTok as unfair.

The Foreign Ministry said last month there is "no fairness to speak of" in citing national security to reduce the competitive advantage of other countries. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[China condemned on Tuesday what it called "groundless accusations" by the United States that Beijing is supporting Russia's war in Ukraine.

"The United States has unveiled a large-scale aid bill for Ukraine while also making groundless accusations against normal trade between China and Russia," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.

"This kind of approach is extremely hypocritical and utterly irresponsible, and China is firmly opposed to it," he said.

Wang reiterated that China has consistently maintained that it is a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict.

"On the Ukraine issue, China has always maintained an objective and just position, advocated actively for peace talks and pushed for a political resolution," Wang said.

He added that Beijing will not accept others "passing the buck" or shifting the blame. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Rescue operations were underway after unseasonably heavy rain caused rivers to overflow, triggering landslides in Yingde city in flood-ravaged Guangdong province, broadcaster CCTV reported on Tuesday.

It comes as the latest figures showed that four people have died as a result of the heavy rain, and 10 others are still missing. Provincial authorities have relocated some 110,000 residents so far.

Rescue and emergency workers were seen tending to stranded residents on rescue boats in residential areas as well as commercial streets, in video aired by CCTV. The broadcaster also reported emergency supplies including food, water and other amenities were being provided.

In one village, farmers stood at a flooded intersection along with belongings they managed to save, including a washing machine.

“Everything's gone, all the seedlings are gone," said Huang Jingrong, 61.

"It's all flooded, flooded beyond repair," he said, estimating his losses at about 100,000 yuan.

Meanwhile, massive flooding has occurred in Beijiang River in the Pearl River basin on Monday due to the continuous heavy rain, according to the Ministry of Water Resources.

Guangdong has been battered by unusually heavy, sustained and widespread rainfall since Thursday, with powerful storms ushering in an earlier-than-normal start to the region's annual flooding season. (Reuters/Xinhua)]]>

    No systemic Chinese doping, says Australian swim coach

    <![CDATA[Australian swimming coach Denis Cotterell has rejected allegations of orchestrated doping in Chinese swimming, saying China is adamant about clean sport.

Cotterell is working with China's top swimmers in the lead-up to the Paris Olympics and previously coached 1,500 metres freestyle world record holder Sun Yang, who is now suspended for a doping offence.

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) confirmed reports over the weekend that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned drug before the Tokyo Olympics.

WADA said it had accepted China's findings that the results were due to contamination and decided against appealing the matter, triggering criticism from top swimmers and the US anti-doping authority.

Cotterell told the Sydney Morning Herald he stood by his swimmers "100%" and said any positive test results in Chinese swimming were not part of a state-run programme.

"I am happy to say I’m absolutely in support of my swimmers and dispute any suggestion of anything orchestrated," Cotterell said.

"The suggestion that it's systemic is so far from anything I have seen here the whole time.

"They are so adamant on having clean sport.

"It's sad to see what this suggests or looks like. It’s unfortunate for everyone. I feel for the athletes here because of how hard they work now to eliminate the tag that was garnered in the '90s."

Leading coaches and swimmers criticised WADA and China's anti-doping authority over the weekend and questioned why the 23 swimmers' test results were not made public.

Cotterell said he understood if rival swimmers were upset and that the process could have been better handled.

"It unfortunately allows that doubt to come out and to surface. I can’t prove anything, I just know the truth," he said.

However, he was also insistent that failed drug tests from contaminated food was a consistent risk in China.

"(Swimmers) are not allowed to eat outside anywhere. When they go on a plane, they can’t eat the food," he added.

Media reports said the swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine (TMZ), which is found in heart medication, months before the Tokyo Games started in July 2021. 

WADA said after reviewing a television documentary and newspaper reports that it stands by its decision to clear the 23 swimmers to compete at the Tokyo Olympics. 

The anti-doping agency issued a statement on Sunday following the release of a documentary on the cases by German broadcaster ARD.

In an earlier statement following initial newspaper reports, WADA said it agreed with Chinese authorities and ruled that the swimmers’ samples had been contaminated.

The New York Times reported that Chinese anti-doping authorities found the results of the tests were Adverse Analytical Findings but cleared the swimmers without any penalties after finding that the samples were flagged as positive as a result of contamination.

“Following WADA’s review of the documentary, the agency still stands firmly by the results of its scientific investigation and legal decision concerning the case,” WADA said in the statement on Sunday. 

“We are equally confident that WADA’s independent Intelligence and Investigations Department followed up on all allegations received, which were not corroborated by any evidence; and thus, did not meet WADA threshold to open an investigation.”

WADA said based on available scientific evidence and intelligence, “which was gathered, assessed and tested by experts in the pharmacology of trimetazidine (TMZ); and, by anti-doping experts,” it had no basis under the global anti-doping code to challenge the Chinese agency's findings of environmental contamination. 

The Foreign Ministry on Monday called reports about the swimmers testing positive "fake news".

"I believe you will also have noted that the World Anti-Doping Agency has put out a very clear response," spokesman Weng Wenbin told a regular briefing.

"After an in-depth and detailed investigation of this incident by the China anti-doping centre in 2021, it was determined that the relevant athletes had ingested contaminated drugs without their knowledge.

"The Chinese swimmers involved were neither at fault nor guilty of negligence, and their behaviour did not constitute a doping violation.

"After an investigation, WADA affirmed the findings of the China anti-doping centre."

Wang added that Beijing has a zero-tolerance position towards doping.

"We strictly adhere to the (relevant) global provisions and resolutely protect the physical and mental health of athletes.

"We uphold fair competition in sports events and have made active contributions to the global fight against doping," he said. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[Authorities in Guangdong on Monday said four people were killed and 10 people were missing after continuous heavy rainfall hit many parts of the province over the past few days. 

The three deaths were reported in Zhaoqing City, while the remaining one is a rescuer in Shaoguan City.

Guangdong's provincial emergency management department said search and rescue operations were still underway.

The heavy rain affected many cities including the provincial capital of Guangzhou, resulting in damaged houses, blocked roads and landslides.

The department said it has so far relocated some 110,000 residents, with 25,800 people being urgently resettled.

Scores of homes either collapsed or were badly damaged, resulting in an economic loss of over 110 million yuan according to officials. 

Rainfall was forecast to continue over the coming three days across the southern regions, with rainstorms hitting parts of Guangdong and Fujian provinces, the National Meteorological Centre said.
 
Persistent heavy rain has affected south China since April 19, with precipitation reaching record highs in several areas. 

Vast regions of the country's south and southwest were expected to see a 50 to 80 percent increase in precipitation in late April compared with the same period in previous years. 

Officials said due to the heavy rain, water levels in 44 rivers within the Pearl River basin had exceeded warning levels as of April 21.

China issued a yellow alert for rainstorms on Monday morning, the third most severe level in the country's four-tier, colour-coded weather warning system. (Xinhua)
