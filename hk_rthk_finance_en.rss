    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks ended lower in choppy trading on Tuesday as Treasury yields climbed, with investors weighing the likely path of interest rates in a resilient US economy with persistent inflation.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday recent inflation data has not given policymakers enough confidence to ease credit soon, noting that the US central bank may need to keep rates higher for longer than previously thought.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average got a boost from UnitedHealth Group's better-than-expected quarterly results. Real estate and utilities were the biggest drags on the S&P 500, while technology gave the largest boost.

"People are trying to balance this two-sided narrative: US economic growth, which looks really good, and at the same time the inflation picture and interest rates, which will eventually be problematic for the equity market," said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in California.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17 percent, to 37,799, the S&P 500 lost 0.21 percent, to 5,051 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.12 percent, to 15,865.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are nearly 4 percent off from record high levels reached last month.

Shares of Morgan Stanley rose 2.5 percent after its first-quarter profit beat estimates on resurging income from investment banking.

Bank of America dropped 3.5 percent after the lender posted lower first-quarter profits as its loan loss provisions grew.

Johnson & Johnson slipped 2.1 percent as the drugmaker's revenue missed analysts' estimates after sales from its blockbuster psoriasis drug, Stelara, fell short of expectations.

Tesla slipped 2.7 percent a day after falling over 5 percent on news that the EV marker plans to lay off more than 10 percent of its global workforce. (Reuters)]]>

    IMF expects steady growth, lower inflation

    <![CDATA[The global economy is set for another year of slow but steady growth, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday, with US strength pushing world output through headwinds from lingering high inflation, weak demand in China and Europe, and spillovers from two regional wars.

The IMF forecast global real GDP growth of 3.2 percent for 2024 and 2025 – the same rate as in 2023. The 2024 forecast was revised upward by 0.1 percentage point from the previous World Economic Outlook's estimate in January, largely due to a significant upward revision in the US outlook.

"The global economy continues to display remarkable resilience with growth holding steady and inflation declining, but many challenges still lie ahead," Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, told reporters.

A potential escalation of the Middle East conflict after Iran's rocket and drone attack on Israel could have a "strong effect" on limiting growth, he said, adding that it would raise oil prices and inflation, triggering tighter monetary policy from central banks.

The US Treasury is preparing to hit Iran with new sanctions in coming days that could limit its ability to export oil, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Tuesday.

The report described an "adverse scenario" in which a Middle East escalation would lead to a 15 percent increase in oil prices and higher shipping costs would hike global inflation by about 0.7 percentage points.

The IMF forecast that global median headline inflation will fall to 2.8 percent by the end of 2024 from 4 percent last year, and to 2.4 percent in 2025.

The IMF left unchanged its forecast for China's 2024 growth to fall to 4.6 percent from 5.2 percent in 2023. But it warned that the lack of a comprehensive restructuring package for the country's property sector could prolong a downturn in domestic demand.

Gourinchas said, however, that China's stronger-than-expected first-quarter growth may prompt an upward revision to the outlook. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[China's economy grew 5.3 percent in the first quarter year-on-year, official data showed on Tuesday, comfortably beating analysts' expectations, a welcome sign for policymakers as they try to shore up demand and confidence.

Analysts polled by Reuters news agency had expected first-quarter gross domestic product to expand 4.6 percent from a year earlier, compared to 5.2 percent in the previous three months.

Sheng Laiyun, National Bureau of Statistics deputy commissioner, said the nation had made solid progress over the period.

"Generally, in the first quarter, the national economy made a good start, accumulating positive factors and laying a solid foundation for achieving the annual goal," Sheng said.

"However, we should say that there are rising complexities and uncertainties in the external environment," he said, adding that authorities will boost economic vitality, prevent and diffuse risks, as well as enhance the momentum for economic recovery and growth.

Mainland officials are aiming for economic growth of around five percent for 2024, a target that many analysts believe is ambitious and may require more stimulus.

Meanwhile, retail sales and industrial production in China slowed in March.

Retail sales growth slowed to 3.1 percent year-on-year in March, down from a 5.5 percent increase in the first two months of 2024, while industrial production rose 4.5 percent, down from a 7 percent increase in the first two months, official data showed. (Reuters/AFP)

    US stocks fall again amid geopolitical worries

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks finished decisively lower on Monday despite solid US economic data, in a decline blamed on worries over conflict in the Middle East.

Equities had opened positively following solid retail sales data, amid early hopes that the conflict between Israel and Iran might ebb after a weekend siege by Iran was mostly repelled by air defences.

But Israeli officials kept up the confrontational rhetoric, with Israel's army chief Herzi Halevi vowing a response.

The Dow Jones finished at 37,735, down 0.7 percent after notching a 650-point fall from its peak earlier in the session.

The S&P 500 dropped 1.2 percent to 5,061, while the Nasdaq fell 1.8 percent to 15,885.

Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare pointed to the geopolitical situation as a factor in Monday's drop, but also noted that the retreat follows a period of market strength.

"If you set aside what's happening geopolitically there have been calls for a while now that the market's due for a pullback," O'Hare said.

"So there's an overdue period of consolidation kicking in here, which has been helped along by the geopolitical uncertainty, rising interest rates, and again, the technical deterioration in the market."

Among individual companies, Goldman Sachs rose 2.9 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits on a strong performance across most businesses.

Tesla slumped 5.6 percent after Elon Musk's electric vehicle company announced it was cutting more than 10 percent of its global headcount amid rising competition for EVs.

Salesforce plunged 7.3 percent following reports it is in talks to buy technology company Informatica. Informatica lost 6.4 percent.

Trump Media & Technology Group, the social media company associated with the ex-president and current US Republican White House nominee, dove 18.4 percent after announcing plans to issue more shares. (AFP)]]>

    Firms win approval to launch spot bitcoin, ether ETFs

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong on Monday gave initial approval to its first spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), paving the way for the city to become Asia’s first to treat cryptocurrencies as a mainstream investment tool, according to fund managers.

At least three offshore Chinese asset managers will launch the virtual asset spot ETFs soon.

The local units of Harvest Fund Management and Bosera Asset Management said they had received conditional approvals from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the city’s securities watchdog, to launch the ETFs.

Meanwhile, the local unit of China Asset Management said it had received regulatory approval for the provision of virtual asset management services, and that it's actively deploying the spot bitcoin and ether ETFs.

Emil Chan, co-chair of the Hong Kong Digital Finance Association, told RTHK that the move will boost the SAR's status as a financial centre.

“There was an exodus earlier that many funds and talent moved from Hong Kong to Singapore because they were unclear about the regulatory status... this time, Hong Kong has moved fast to catch up in a short period of time,” he said.

The fintech specialist also noted that traditional investors may be attracted to this market as the crypto ETFs allow them to utilise the traditional trading mechanism to access such assets without needing to worry about managing cryptocurrency keys and storage.

The US launched its first ETFs to track spot bitcoin in January, drawing roughly US$12 billion in net flows.

The city’s bourse may take about two weeks to prepare the funds to be offered, meaning the first set of spot ETFs could be available as early as this month.

“The [approval] of the crypto ETFs sent a strong signal to the traditional securities trading markets and players that they have to move forward to look into crypto trading with a different perspective," Chan said.

“In the past they considered crypto as unreal, but now it’s being sorted, and if its progress is solid, then it will boost transition and development of the virtual asset industry.” (Additional reporting by Reuters)]]>

It's the 13th time since 2010 that the airport has been named the busiest cargo airport in the world.

    <![CDATA[Mainland tea shop chain Sichuan Baicha Baidao Industrial aims to raise HK$2.5 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO), in the city's largest new-share sale of 2024, regulatory filings showed on Monday.

The company is selling 147.7 million shares at HK$17.50 each, which represents about 10 percent of its total shares, the filings showed.

An extra 22.1 million shares could be sold through a so-called greenshoe option. That would see the total number of shares increase to 169.9 million, to raise almost HK$3 billion.

The shares will start trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on April 23.

Baicha Baidao operates ChaPanda stores which sell a range of fruit tea drinks primarily to younger customers, the company said in its IPO prospectus.

Hong Kong IPO volume is at its lowest level in more than a decade with new-share sales raising US$507 million in the first quarter of this year, down nearly 29 percent from US$710 million from the same time last year, LSEG data showed. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Iran's attack on Israel has injected fresh anxiety into oil markets already roiled by regional tensions, but analysts stress that it is unclear if a durable price spike is imminent.

Saturday's overnight drone and missile barrage was Iran's first-ever direct assault on Israeli territory.

Tehran says it was triggered by the April 1 air strike on its consulate building in the Syrian capital that was widely blamed on Israel.

The Iranian mission to the United Nations warned on X of "considerably more severe" actions should Israel "make another mistake," raising the prospect of intensifying violence in the days ahead.

Oil prices had already jumped in the build-up to the Iranian attack, with benchmark Brent North Sea Crude closing on Friday at US$90.45 per barrel.

Prices are expected to climb further when markets reopen on Monday, perhaps as high as US$95 per barrel, though it is too soon to say whether they will stay elevated, said Kuwaiti oil expert Kamel al-Harami.

"The picture is not clear about the future. We do not know if and how Israel will respond and whether Iran will also resort to stopping oil supplies as a response," he said.

The Islamic republic was the world's seventh-largest crude producer in 2022, and has the third-largest proven oil reserves behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, according to the United States Energy Information Administration.

Iran also has a range of ways to wreak havoc with markets, including disrupting maritime traffic through the Strait of Hormuz and pressuring countries such as Iraq to cut supply, Harami said.

"There are several scenarios... The fear is that Iran will stop exporting oil or attack oil facilities," Harami said. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks finished a volatile week sharply lower, falling on Friday on anxiety over a potential escalation of conflict in the Middle East.

Market watchers cited worries about an imminent attack on Israel by Iran to retaliate for a strike in Damascus – a possibility also raised by President Joe Biden, who urged Iran against the move.

After spending the entire session in the red, the Dow Jones finished down 1.2 percent, or 475 points, at 37,983.

The S&P 500 dropped 1.5 percent to 5,123, while the Nasdaq shed 1.6 percent to 16,175.

The geopolitical angst came after a hot consumer price report on Wednesday sent stocks tumbling only to be reversed on Thursday in a move seen as a relief rally.

Equities have been under pressure in recent weeks as traders bet that the Federal Reserve will push back interest rate cuts due to inflation.

JPMorgan Chase on Friday sank 6.5 percent despite strong first-quarter earnings as the large bank highlighted worries over geopolitics and inflation.

"The market is probably too happy," CEO Jamie Dimon said on a conference call with reporters. "I think the chance of bad outcomes is higher than other people think."

Among other large financial companies reporting results, Citigroup fell 1.7 percent, Wells Fargo dipped 0.2 percent and BlackRock dropped 2.9 percent. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[China’s exports contracted sharply in March while imports also unexpectedly shrank, underlining the task facing the country’s policymakers as they try to shore up a sluggish economy.

Figures from the General Administration of Customs showed that shipments from China slumped 7.5 percent year-on-year to US$279.7 billion, marking the largest fall since last August and missing market forecasts of a 3 percent decline.

It also came in sharp contrast to a 7.1 percent rise during the January-February period.

Imports, meanwhile, also declined last month, dropping 1.9 percent year-on-year to US$221.1 billion, missing an expected 1.4 percent rise. The first two months of the year had seen growth of 3.5 percent.

The latest figures left the country’s trade surplus at US$58.6 billion last month, compared with US$125.1 billion in the January-February period.

For the first quarter, however, both imports and exports rose 1.5 percent.

By region, exports to the US fell 1.3 percent, while imports from the US fell nearly 11 percent in the first quarter. Shipments to Russia rose 3 percent, while those from Russia rose 7 percent.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) remained China’s largest trading partner with exports to the region rising 4.1 percent during the first quarter and imports from the region growing 1 percent.

Wang Lingjun, vice minister of the General Administration of Customs, said that while geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism have brought challenges to global trade, there are signs of a gradual recovery.

He said he expects the country’s trade to stabilise in the second quarter. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the government's Digital Economy Development Committee, which he chairs, has come up with 12 recommendations.

They cover five key areas, namely strengthening digital policy, IT infrastructure, cross-border data flow, getting businesses to adopt new technology and attracting qualified people, Chan said.

The proposals include setting up a digital policy office to help make the city smarter, getting a super computing centre up and running by the end of the year, extending commercial data interchange to offer loans to businesses effectively, and a study on data trading.

“We see clear potential for international data trading to become a new and thriving industry in this city. With that in mind, we have commissioned an expert group to study how best to develop a robust data trading system in Hong Kong. This is an area of tremendous promise for us,” Chan said.

The minister's remarks were made at the Digital Economy Summit, where he also said that the digital economy has clearly emerged as a new “driving force” for global economic development.

“The landscape is complex and rapidly changing, competition among cities and economies in this field is intense, Hong Kong must move fast to stay ahead of the curve,” Chan said.

Separately, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong stressed that new technology should be used in a sustainable way.

“How we are going to achieve a sustainable future is the development by maintaining a balance between using technology in an intelligent way while at the same time promoting, creating, and maximising the long-term value by using technology in a safe and responsible way,” he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Apple and other tech shares led US equities higher on Thursday following mixed inflation data and a European Central Bank decision that signalled a possible imminent interest rate cut.

US wholesale inflation rose by 0.2 percent in March, less than expected. However, on an annual level the index for final demand increased 2.1 percent for the 12 months ending in March -- its highest level since April 2023.

Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management said the equity gains reflected investor "relief" that the inflation report "wasn't worse than expected" after Wednesday's consumer price report sent stocks tumbling.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished flat at 38,459.

The S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent to 5,199, and the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 1.7 percent to 16,442.

Apple jumped nearly four percent following a JPMorgan Chase report that pointed to improving investor sentiment on the company, in part due to enthusiasm that iPhones will benefit from upgrades for more AI technology.

Chip companies also had a good day, with Nvidia, Broadcom and Micron all winning more than four percent.

The European Central Bank, as expected, held interest rates steady again but said slowing inflation could open the door to easing monetary policy, raising hopes of a first cut in June.

Investors are looking ahead to earnings from major banks on Friday. JPMorgan Chase was flat, while Wells Fargo fell 0.4 percent and Citi climbed 0.9 percent. All three report on Friday. (AFP)]]>
