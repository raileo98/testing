    <![CDATA[The number of negative equity cases reached a 20-year high in the first quarter, figures released by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) showed.

According to the HKMA, there were 32,073 cases at the end of March, up 27 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 and the most since the first quarter of 2004.

The HKMA noted that the loans had mainly been taken out by bank staff or linked to mortgage insurance, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio.

Government figures out last week showed home prices rebounded in March, snapping a 10-month losing streak. That's after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech on February 28.]]>

    Asia's first crypto ETFs gain in HK debut

    <![CDATA[Six spot bitcoin and ether exchange traded funds (ETFs) gained in their Hong Kong debut on Tuesday.

The launch of Asia's first cryptocurrency-based ETFs comes three months after a similar move in the United States.

Unlike in the US, however, crypto enthusiasts in Hong Kong can also invest by swapping their own tokens, as well as buying with cash.

After listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange, bitcoin ETFs launched by China AMC, Harvest and Bosera climbed more than 2 percent by midday, while three funds linked to ether were also up. 

Speaking at a launch event, the executive director of the Securities and Futures Commission, Christina Choi, said the ETFs mark a milestone for Hong Kong.

Choi warned would-be investors, however, that virtual assets aren't for everyone.

"Virtual assets themselves are highly speculative and their prices are extremely volatile. bitcoin and ether have in the past experienced a 40 percent drop in a single day and over 60 percent drop within a year," she said.

"Therefore, I would like to remind everyone that virtual assets are not suitable for all investors. Only those who have a thorough understanding of them and can withstand the risks should consider these products."

Meanwhile, the CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, Bonnie Chan, said the ETFs will boost the local market. 

"The listing of six virtual asset ETFs today will further enrich Hong Kong's ETF product offerings. It will attract more investors to participate in the Hong Kong ETF market, enhance market liquidity, promote Hong Kong's development as an attractive ETF market in Asia, and strengthen its competitiveness as an international asset management hub," Chan said.

Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan told the same event that the listings demonstrate Hong Kong's status as a leading virtual assets market in Asia.]]>

    HSBC says chief executive Noel Quinn 'to retire'

    <![CDATA[HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn will retire, the bank said on Tuesday, in a surprise departure from the business that he has overhauled in the past five years through a sweeping series of asset sales across the globe.

The bank said it has already launched a formal process to find a successor, with Chief Financial Officer Georges Elhedery likely the leading internal candidate for the job.

At the same time, HSBC reported a 1.8 percent drop in first-quarter profit as it struggles to cope with rising costs from expansion in Asia and amid inflationary pressures.

Pretax profit came in at US$12.7 billion for the quarter ended March versus US$12.9 billion a year earlier.

The results were better than the US$12.6 billion average of analysts' forecasts compiled by HSBC.

The London-headquartered bank also announced US$3 billion worth of share buybacks on top of US$2 billion in share purchases announced in February. 

Speaking during a media call, Quinn said he informed the group's chairman Mark Tucker of his decision last month, saying he wanted to have a better work-life balance after an "intense" five-year period in the top job.

"I would never have dreamed of being the CEO in the bank 37 years ago and it's a privilege. But you also have to look forward and say what's right for you personally, and I did a lot reflecting on that over Christmas, the New Year, and January," he said.

"I think it's right for me, but also think it's right for the bank, it's a natural transition point for the bank," adding he would work hard to ensure a smooth transition for his successor.

Tucker thanked Quinn for his leadership and for his years of work at the bank, and said he and the board fully "support and respect that decision". (Reuters)

The HSBC group chairman also said the board and its nomination committee hoped to name a new chief executive in the second half of this year.

    China factory activity slows in April

    <![CDATA[China's manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace in April, an official factory survey showed on Tuesday, suggesting some loss of momentum for the sector at the start of the second quarter.

The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 50.4 in April from 50.8 in March, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and just ahead of a median forecast of 50.3 in a Reuters poll.

The data underlines the challenges facing policymakers even though solid first quarter GDP growth had reduced some of the urgency to ramp up stimulus measures.

New export orders grew at a much slower rate, while employment continued to shrink, the NBS's PMI data showed.

Still, a private Caixin factory survey, which was also released on Tuesday, showed manufacturing activity grew more quickly as new export orders rose, providing a more optimistic outlook than the official data.

Investors expect Beijing to launch more stimulus to support the economy and were waiting for the outcome of a politburo meeting, which is expected to focus on economic affairs this month. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks finished higher on Monday, extending a rally from late last week ahead of a Federal Reserve decision and key earnings reports in the coming days.

A news-jammed week includes Wednesday's Fed decision, where the central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged but will update investors on the prospects for cuts.

Investors will also digest April jobs data, as well as surveys measuring manufacturing sector health and consumer confidence.

"This week has something for everyone," said a note from Charles Schwab.

The Dow Jones advanced 0.4 percent to 38,386.

The S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent to 5,116, while the Nasdaq climbed 0.4 percent to 15,983.

Apple, Coca-Cola and Pfizer are among the large companies reporting quarterly earnings.

Companies in the S&P 500 have thus reported an average of 3.5 percent higher earnings compared with the year-ago period, according to Factset.

Among individual companies, Tesla shot up nearly 15 percent after receiving a key security clearance from the Chinese government for smart cars during a visit to China by Chief Executive Elon Musk.

Apple gained 2.7 percent following an upgrade from equity analysts at Bernstein.

Domino's Pizza jumped 5.6 percent as it reported a 6.1 percent increase in first-quarter sales to US$4.4 billion. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday Hong Kong's GDP growth in the first quarter is expected to be in line with the government's forecast of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent. 

He said the advance estimates for the January-March period, which will be announced on Thursday, would reflect moderate growth for the economy for five straight quarters, dating back to the start of 2023.

"Besides opening up new points for economic growth, we also need to continue to consolidate the traditional elements," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.

He noted the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holidays would attract an estimated 800,000 visitors to Hong Kong, highlighted by a maiden pyrotechnic display at Victoria Harbour on May 1.

The financial secretary said a series of mega events will follow, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, the World Cultures Festival and the Vinexpo Asia for a showcase of wine and spirits late next month.

On stocks, Chan said the Hang Seng Index rose by 8.8 percent in the past week, its best weekly performance in 13 years. 

He attributed the surge to tech shares buoyed by AI and IT developments, as well as stimulus measures by mainland authorities.

Chan added that an updated scheme allowing some mainland residents to buy wealth management products in Hong Kong made tremendous strides last month.

The Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme recorded more than 13.1 billion yuan in transactions in March, which the finance chief said was close to half of the total amount since the scheme's launch in late 2021.]]>

    <![CDATA[US stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent to 38,239, the S&P 500 gained 1 percent to 5,099, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.0 percent to 15,927. 

Investors cheered Alphabet's first-ever dividend, its US$70 billion stock buyback program, and better-than-expected first-quarter results. Its shares jumped to a record high, lifting the Google-parent's market value above US$2 trillion.

Microsoft shares rose after its third-quarter revenue and profit exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by gains from artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across its cloud services. On Wednesday, Meta results had disappointed investors even as the company ratcheted up spending on AI. 

"The earnings reports of Microsoft and Google allayed a lot of the concerns about the fact that the spending on data centers and AI, which Meta had raised a day before, was going to compress margins," said Tom Plumb, president and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds in Madison, Wisconsin. 

"Both Google and Microsoft had indicated that with their current capital plans, they still expected their margins to expand. That allayed a lot of the fears that people had about the growth of data computing," Plumb added.

US Commerce Department data showed monthly inflation rose moderately in March on an annual basis while coming in line with estimates on a monthly basis.

The report offered some relief to financial markets spooked by worries of stagflation a day after data showed inflation surging and economic growth slowing in the first quarter.

After the data, money markets priced in a firmer chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell after the data, last standing at 4.6692 percent  .

Shares of Snap surged after the social media firm beat first-quarter estimates for revenue and user growth. Pinterest shares also finished higher.

Exxon Mobil lost ground after America's largest oil company missed analysts' estimates with first-quarter profit falling 28 percent from a year ago.

Intel dropped after the chipmaker's forecast for second-quarter revenue and profit did not meet estimates. Intel faces weak demand for its traditional data centre and PC chips. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[The US central bank's favoured measure of inflation accelerated last month, according to government data published on Friday, pushing back the chances of an interest rate cut this summer.

The hotter print is likely to cement the view that inflation, while down sharply since 2022, remains a challenge, and could keep the Federal Reserve on pause as it seeks to battle rising prices.

It also complicates US president Joe Biden's re-election message as he seeks to convince sceptical consumers that the economy is heading in the right direction ahead of November's vote.

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in March, up 0.2 percentage points from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said in a statement.

This was above the median forecast of 2.6 percent in a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.

Much of the overall annual rise came from the services sector, which increased at an annual rate of 4.0 percent.

Among the more volatile items, energy prices rose by 2.6 percent from a year ago, while food prices were up 1.5 percent.

"While inflation has fallen more than 60 percent from its peak, today's report reinforces the importance of our ongoing work to bring costs down," White House national economic advisor Lael Brainard said in a statement.

On a monthly basis, PCE inflation rose by 0.3 percent, in line with the figure from February, the Commerce Department said.

The closely watched "core" measure of inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in March, unchanged from a month earlier.

The March figures reaffirm the concern among economists that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than previously thought -- complicating the Federal Reserve's fight to bring it down firmly to its long-term target of two percent through interest rate hikes. (AFP)]]>

    ByteDance says 'no plans' to sell TikTok

    <![CDATA[Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok after a new US law put it on a deadline to divest from the hugely popular video platform or have it banned in the United States.

Tech publication, The Information, earlier reported that ByteDance is exploring scenarios for selling TikTok's US business without the algorithm that recommends videos to TikTok users. ByteDance denied it was considering a sale.

"Foreign media reports about ByteDance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue," the company posted on Thursday on Toutiao, a Chinese-language platform it owns.

"ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok."

TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew said on Wednesday the social media company expects to win a legal challenge to block legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden that he said would ban its popular short video app used by 170 million Americans.

The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the US Senate on Tuesday, is driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or use the app for surveillance.

Biden's signing sets a January 19 deadline for a sale – one day before his term is poised to expire – but he could extend the deadline by three months if he determines privately owned ByteDance is making progress. (AFP/Reuters)]]>

    Home prices rebound after 10-month fall

    <![CDATA[Home prices rebounded in March, rising one percent month-on-month and ending a 10-month falling streak.

Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department showed that the official private flat price index edged up to 305.7, from 302.5 in February.

However, prices were still more than 13 percent lower on a yearly basis and 23 percent lower than the all-time high recorded in 2021.

Rents also edged up in March, rising 0.5 percent on a monthly basis, or 5.6 percent on an annual basis, following a two-month falling streak.

The increases came after the government lifted all remaining property cooling measures in the budget in late February.

“The city’s property market has seen a revenge-style rebound after the lifting of the cooling measures, as the buyers’ sentiment noticeably improved,” said Martin Wong, director and head of research & consultancy, Greater China, at Knight Frank Hong Kong.

“However, prices of lived-in homes may continue to weaken due to the impact of sales of new homes. And as the interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve may also come later than the markets anticipated, meaning the city may start cutting rates from late third quarter, the high rates may continue weighing on the market.”

Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at Colliers Hong Kong, struck a cautious note on the property price outlook due to surging supplies and an uncertain path for interest rate cuts, saying she expects a five to 10 percent fall over the year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks closed lower on Thursday as markets were stunned by data showing slower-than-expected US economic growth and persistent inflation, coupled with a sell-off in large cap stocks triggered by disappointing results from Meta Platforms.

Data on Thursday showed that the US economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly two years in the first quarter while inflation accelerated, dampening hopes that the Federal Reserve would begin cutting interest rates this year.

Disappointing results from Meta, whose shares plunged nearly 11 percent, also weighed on market sentiment. Three other Magnificent Seven stocks, including Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft, finished lower.

However, shares of Alphabet and Microsoft were advancing in extended hours trading after both companies reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates. Intel forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below market estimates, sending its shares down 8 percent in extended hours trading.

"The GDP numbers definitely puts a ding in the paradigm that markets were hanging onto for equities in terms of high growth; and if you don't have high growth that will translate to lower-than-expected earnings," said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in California.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.98 percent, to 38,086, the S&P 500 lost 0.46 percent, to 5,048 and the Nasdaq lost 0.64 percent, to 15,612.

Separately, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to still tight labour market conditions. The March Personal Consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is due on Friday.

"The double whammy was also the inflation number that came in stronger than expected so there wasn't really a silver lining in that report; it's still positive in absolute terms but relative to high expectations it was disappointing," St. Aubin added.

International Business Machines fell 8 percent after it announced a US$6.4 billion deal to buy HashiCorp alongside its first-quarter results, in which revenue missed estimates.

Southwest Airlines slid nearly 7 percent as the carrier slashed its projections for new aircraft deliveries from Boeing in 2024 for the third time. Caterpillar shed 7 percent after it cut second quarter sales forecasts as demand for its construction equipment eases from last year's boom. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's exports increased 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, according to official figures released on Thursday.

Despite a slight decline in February, exports picked up 4.7 percent in March on a year-on-year basis, resulting in an overall surge for the quarter. 

Exports to Thailand saw the largest expansion, followed by those to the United Arab Emirates and the mainland, while shipments to the Netherlands dropped in the first three months of the year. 

Meanwhile, imports saw 8 percent year-on-year growth in the quarter. 

In a statement, a government spokesperson said uncertainty remains in the city's exports performance. 

"Looking ahead, geopolitical tensions and a longer period of tight financial conditions will continue to affect Hong Kong's export performance, though the slightly better-than-expected external demand may provide some support," the spokesperson said.]]>

    New tools needed to reduce FX risks: ABAC

    <![CDATA[The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) on Thursday called for new tools to reduce foreign exchange risks due to concerns about widening interest rate differentials between the United States and emerging economies. 

It also urged greater digitisation of the trade process to boost economic integration within the Asia Pacific region.

Speaking at the end of a four-day meeting in Hong Kong, Tom Harley, an Australian ABAC member, said the council was studying an exchange rate tool known as a World Parity Unit which might be able to reduce foreign exchange risks.

The unit represents an exchange rate between a basket of currencies from developed countries and those from emerging markets.

“[So] rather than borrowing in US dollars and just having a single-currency risk, it borrows against a basket of world currencies, and it has the potential to reduce currency risk in cross-border borrowing, particularly for the energy transition, by up to 25 percent,” Harley noted.

“We are now working on how it can be implemented... to deal with a critical problem,” he added.

The proposal comes as a strong US dollar, due to interest rates that have held steadily higher over a longer than expected period, continues to weigh on currencies in the Asia Pacific region, posing foreign exchange risks. 

This concern was shared by Hiroshi Nakaso, ABAC’s Japanese member, who chairs the council’s finance and investment task force.

The former deputy governor of the Bank of Japan also called for greater efforts in promoting digitisation of the entire trade process in the Asia Pacific region to enhance economic integration.

“Currently many parts of the trade process, if not all, are conducted on a manual or paper basis, such as letter of credit or insurance policy. So this is incurring huge losses, opportunity costs, for the regional economy.” 

“The initiatives that I mentioned are intended to digitalise the entire trade process, so that the cost and the time required can be greatly reduced and help regional economic integration,” Nakaso said. 

Separately, Frank Ning, a China member who chairs ABAC's sustainability working group, called for a green free trade framework in the Asia Pacific to tackle climate change, noting that business groups in the region also wanted the trade environment to be improved - in the wake of rising Sino-US tensions.

“We have a very strong proposal between the Chinese delegation and the US delegation on ABAC to have a sustainable supply chain, which demonstrates the strong will from business to see an improved free trade environment.”

“We want to see that back. We do not want to see a confrontational or trade barrier type of policy,” Ning said.

Other key proposals include the empowerment of women in trade, boosting women’s participation in green trade and venture capital, noted Julia Torreblanca, the council’s chair for 2024.

The council, an advisory body to APEC economic leaders, held a meeting in Hong Kong between April 22 and 25, to promote free trade in the Asia Pacific region, with some 200 delegates in the city for the first time since 2015.]]>
