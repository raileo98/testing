    Wall Street down on GDP blow, tech worries

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks closed lower on Thursday as markets were stunned by data showing slower-than-expected US economic growth and persistent inflation, coupled with a sell-off in large cap stocks triggered by disappointing results from Meta Platforms.

Data on Thursday showed that the US economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly two years in the first quarter while inflation accelerated, dampening hopes that the Federal Reserve would begin cutting interest rates this year.

Disappointing results from Meta, whose shares plunged nearly 11 percent, also weighed on market sentiment. Three other Magnificent Seven stocks, including Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft, finished lower.

However, shares of Alphabet and Microsoft were advancing in extended hours trading after both companies reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates. Intel forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below market estimates, sending its shares down 8 percent in extended hours trading.

"The GDP numbers definitely puts a ding in the paradigm that markets were hanging onto for equities in terms of high growth; and if you don't have high growth that will translate to lower-than-expected earnings," said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in California.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.98 percent, to 38,086, the S&P 500 lost 0.46 percent, to 5,048 and the Nasdaq lost 0.64 percent, to 15,612.

Separately, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to still tight labour market conditions. The March Personal Consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is due on Friday.

"The double whammy was also the inflation number that came in stronger than expected so there wasn't really a silver lining in that report; it's still positive in absolute terms but relative to high expectations it was disappointing," St. Aubin added.

International Business Machines fell 8 percent after it announced a US$6.4 billion deal to buy HashiCorp alongside its first-quarter results, in which revenue missed estimates.

Southwest Airlines slid nearly 7 percent as the carrier slashed its projections for new aircraft deliveries from Boeing in 2024 for the third time. Caterpillar shed 7 percent after it cut second quarter sales forecasts as demand for its construction equipment eases from last year's boom. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's exports increased 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, according to official figures released on Thursday.

Despite a slight decline in February, exports picked up 4.7 percent in March on a year-on-year basis, resulting in an overall surge for the quarter. 

Exports to Thailand saw the largest expansion, followed by those to the United Arab Emirates and the mainland, while shipments to the Netherlands dropped in the first three months of the year. 

Meanwhile, imports saw 8 percent year-on-year growth in the quarter. 

In a statement, a government spokesperson said uncertainty remains in the city's exports performance. 

"Looking ahead, geopolitical tensions and a longer period of tight financial conditions will continue to affect Hong Kong's export performance, though the slightly better-than-expected external demand may provide some support," the spokesperson said.]]>

    New tools needed to reduce FX risks: ABAC

    <![CDATA[The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) on Thursday called for new tools to reduce foreign exchange risks due to concerns about widening interest rate differentials between the United States and emerging economies. 

It also urged greater digitisation of the trade process to boost economic integration within the Asia Pacific region.

Speaking at the end of a four-day meeting in Hong Kong, Tom Harley, an Australian ABAC member, said the council was studying an exchange rate tool known as a World Parity Unit which might be able to reduce foreign exchange risks.

The unit represents an exchange rate between a basket of currencies from developed countries and those from emerging markets.

“[So] rather than borrowing in US dollars and just having a single-currency risk, it borrows against a basket of world currencies, and it has the potential to reduce currency risk in cross-border borrowing, particularly for the energy transition, by up to 25 percent,” Harley noted.

“We are now working on how it can be implemented... to deal with a critical problem,” he added.

The proposal comes as a strong US dollar, due to interest rates that have held steadily higher over a longer than expected period, continues to weigh on currencies in the Asia Pacific region, posing foreign exchange risks. 

This concern was shared by Hiroshi Nakaso, ABAC’s Japanese member, who chairs the council’s finance and investment task force.

The former deputy governor of the Bank of Japan also called for greater efforts in promoting digitisation of the entire trade process in the Asia Pacific region to enhance economic integration.

“Currently many parts of the trade process, if not all, are conducted on a manual or paper basis, such as letter of credit or insurance policy. So this is incurring huge losses, opportunity costs, for the regional economy.” 

“The initiatives that I mentioned are intended to digitalise the entire trade process, so that the cost and the time required can be greatly reduced and help regional economic integration,” Nakaso said. 

Separately, Frank Ning, a China member who chairs ABAC's sustainability working group, called for a green free trade framework in the Asia Pacific to tackle climate change, noting that business groups in the region also wanted the trade environment to be improved - in the wake of rising Sino-US tensions.

“We have a very strong proposal between the Chinese delegation and the US delegation on ABAC to have a sustainable supply chain, which demonstrates the strong will from business to see an improved free trade environment.”

“We want to see that back. We do not want to see a confrontational or trade barrier type of policy,” Ning said.

Other key proposals include the empowerment of women in trade, boosting women’s participation in green trade and venture capital, noted Julia Torreblanca, the council’s chair for 2024.

The council, an advisory body to APEC economic leaders, held a meeting in Hong Kong between April 22 and 25, to promote free trade in the Asia Pacific region, with some 200 delegates in the city for the first time since 2015.]]>

    <![CDATA[The benchmark S&P 500 closed higher in choppy trading on Wednesday, as investors weighed an uptick in Treasury yields amid positive corporate results particularly from technology giants.

An auction of a record US$70 billion worth of five-year US Treasury notes on Wednesday helped to push bond yields higher and had weighed on equities. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose five basis points to 4.6459 percent.

The Dow finished lower while the Nasdaq ended higher.

Investors were also focused on quarterly earnings from companies, especially from megacap growth stocks. Shares of Meta Platforms fell 11 percent in extended hours trading after the tech giant reported that its capital expenditure could reach up to US$40 billion in 2024, even as its first quarter revenue beat estimates.

Microsoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their results later this week.

Tesla jumped 12 percent after the electric vehicle maker's plans to boost production and roll out more affordable models overshadowed its weak quarterly results.

"My biggest concern is the bond market, particularly the long end of the US yield curve," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.

The S&P 500 gained 0.02 percent to 5,072 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.10 percent, to 15,713. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11 percent, to 38,461.

Markets are eyeing first quarter gross domestic product data on Thursday and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for March on Friday. Hotter-than-expected consumer price inflation report for March had pushed back expectations of when the Fed will begin cutting interest rates.

Shares of Boeing fell 2.8 percent after the planemaker reported its first quarterly revenue drop in seven quarters, even though the result beat analyst expectations.

    <![CDATA[Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.

The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.

The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.

Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.

Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.

Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The outgoing chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Laura Cha, on Wednesday said the city’s stock exchange operator would continue to go “international” as it considered all options to stimulate market turnover.

This came as Cha hosted her last annual general meeting with shareholders before stepping down from the role she held over the past six years after reaching a two-term limit.

Speaking at the meeting, Cha, 74, said the city’s bourse would continue developing connectivity with other exchanges in the world.

“With regard to our international development, it’s not going to stop, it will continue,” Cha said.

“It’s not just about opening two [new] offices. Over the past year we have done a lot of work, we have also signed expressions of interest with two exchanges elsewhere, so that we will also be able to broaden the scope of listing to move forward,” she added.

She also noted the group would consider measures that could stimulate trading volumes, adding HKEX welcomes all firms - no matter if they are big or small - to list in the SAR.

“Do we want bigger companies or smaller companies, that's not up to us to choose, it depends on what companies make applications. We extend fair and equal treatment to all applicants. Even for small companies if they can satisfy all the standards, they can still be listed,” she said.

Her remarks came as some shareholders questioned whether the bourse would try and go after larger enterprises, such as electric-vehicle battery maker CATL, to list in Hong Kong.

As the exchange’s first female chair, Cha thanked shareholders and colleagues for their support over the past six years.

"It's been a privilege and an honour to have presided over this great organisation over the past six years," Cha said.

As Cha stepped down, the exchange’s new board of directors immediately appointed former Securities and Futures Commission chair, Carlson Tong, as the new HKEX chairman for a three-year term until 2025.

Tong's appointment is subject to the written approval of the Chief Executive, and a further announcement will be issued later.

Cha, meanwhile, will continue to serve as senior advisor to the exchange’s board until April next year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday reported a 13 percent annual decline in its net profit in the first quarter of this year, as lower turnover weighed on fees, while fewer listings eroded revenues.

Data from the city’s bourse showed the group’s profit stood at HK$2.97 billion for the first three months of the year, compared with the HK$3.4 billion seen in the same period a year ago when economic activities rebounded after Covid.

Revenue and other income also declined, dropping 6 percent year on year to HK$5.2 billion.

The declines came as average daily trading turnover dropped 22 percent year on year to HK$99.4 billion, while listing fees fell 25 percent year on year following the reduction in the number of new listings.

However, the lower income was partially offset by strong derivatives trading, record quarterly high turnover in the Northbound Stock Connect, as well as increased trades at its subsidiary, the London Metal Exchange.

“The HKEX demonstrated its strength and resilience in the first quarter of the year,” said the group’s newly appointed chief executive Bonnie Chan.

“Despite a fragile global backdrop, the group’s derivatives and commodities business performed strongly - the former achieving record quarterly volume,” she said, adding there was a notable increase in daily trading volume in March and April, indicating growing confidence.

“Looking ahead, despite the prevailing backdrop, we are optimistic about HKEX’s ability to capitalise on the long-term growth of China, the considerable opportunities to connect with the fast-growing capital hubs of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and the continuing exciting developments in technology in our industry and beyond,” Chan said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks rose for a second straight session on Tuesday, building on the prior day's positive momentum following a round of mostly good corporate earnings.

General Electric, Spotify Technology and Kimberly-Clark were among the companies winning strong gains after quarterly reports.

Briefing.com described the broad gains as "follow-through buying" after a rough period that generated talk that the market was "oversold" on a short-term basis.

The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,503.

The S&P 500 advanced 1.2 percent to 5,070, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.6 percent to 15,696.

After last week's losses, US stocks began the week on Monday on a solid note, advancing amid relief that there was no escalation in tensions between Iran and Israel over the weekend.

Among individual companies, General Motors shot up 4.4 percent as it lifted its full-year forecast following better than expected quarterly earnings. The automaker continued to point to solid pricing in the United States, which helped offset weakness in China.

GE Aerospace gained 8.3 percent after lifting its projections after reporting an uptick in orders and operating profit.

But JetBlue sank 18.9 percent as it projected lower revenues in the second quarter, noting that there is "significant elevated capacity" in the company's Latin region, pressuring results. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[London's FTSE 100 stocks index hit record highs on Tuesday, catching up with major global peers that have struck all-time peaks this year as inflation cools.

Sentiment was upbeat across major world indices thanks to easing Middle East worries and hopes of interest-rate cuts, while traders are keenly awaiting the release this week of more major earnings and key US inflation data.

London's FTSE 100 reached 8,076 points shortly after the open, surpassing a record 8,047 struck in February last year, though it pared down gains in afternoon deals.

"Good news as this is, it does highlight the sluggishness of the UK's top equity index when compared to its US and European competitors which hit a string of successive records throughout the first quarter of 2024," said David Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services provider Trade Nation.

But, he added, "let's not be too churlish as it could be we see the FTSE outperform its rivals in the years to come should investors seek out dividend paying value stocks rather than techy growthy ones."

The index has in recent weeks been lifted by a weakening of the pound, particularly against the dollar, as markets anticipate cuts to UK interest rates in the coming months thanks to slowing price rises.

A weaker pound benefits FTSE-listed British multinationals that make big earnings in foreign currencies. Sterling gained against the dollar and euro on Tuesday after falling earlier in the day.

The Paris and Frankfurt stock markets won a lift from news of an improvement to business activity in the eurozone this month.

Wall Street opened higher on a busy week on the corporate front, with investors keenly awaiting first-quarter earnings from Elon Musk's Tesla later in the day.

The electric car maker, which enjoyed scorching growth for most of 2022 and 2023, has experienced setbacks that analysts say have raised the stakes for the first-quarter report. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's inflation rate slightly rose in March, with the Composite Consumer Price Index up two percent on a year earlier. 

That compared to the 1.9 percent inflation rate in the previous two months. 

Figures released by the Census and Statistics Department showed that underlying inflation, stripping out short-term relief measures, was also up marginally in March, at one percent.

Alcohol and tobacco prices surged nearly 18 percent year-on-year, while meals out and takeaways were up 3.3 percent and housing costs rose 3.1 percent. 

Electricity, gas and water prices dropped 8.7 percent. 

A government spokesperson said the underlying price inflation was “modest” in March, noting that prices of basic foods edged down.

“Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay contained in the near term. Domestic costs may face some upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain on a broad downward trend, though heightened geopolitical tensions will bring uncertainties,” the spokesperson added. 

For the first quarter of 2024, overall consumer prices rose 1.9 percent year-on-year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks powered higher on Monday, shrugging off recent weakness at the start of a heavy week of earnings from technology and industrial companies.

"The markets are breathing a collective sigh of relief that the tensions in the Middle East didn't escalate," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments.

Stocks tumbled on Friday, in part due to selling ahead of the weekend amid fears of a worsening in the Israel-Iran conflict.

The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,239.

The S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent to 5,010, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.1 percent to 15,451.

All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 finished in positive territory.

This week's earnings calendar includes results from tech titans such as Amazon and Microsoft, as well as from industrial companies including Chevron and General Motors.

Tesla, which also reports this week, fell 3.4 percent following another round of price cuts – the latest sign of intensifying competition among electric vehicle manufacturers.

Verizon dropped 4.6 percent as analysts cited worries about a soft demand picture, with net broadband subscriber additions slowing compared with the prior quarter.

Nike slid 0.4 percent after disclosing to state officials in Oregon that it plans to cut 740 jobs from its headquarters. (AFP)]]>

    'More efforts needed to revive stock market sentiment'

    <![CDATA[Financial analysts on Monday said that a pledge by the nation’s securities regulator to offer support in enhancing Hong Kong's role as a global financial hub can provide a short-term boost to market sentiment, but more measures are needed.

Shares on the Hang Seng Index and Tech Index enjoyed a bump after the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on Friday said it would facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms, and loosen rules on stock trading links between exchanges in the SAR and on the mainland.

Under the measures, the scope of eligible exchange-traded funds (ETFs) via the links will be widened, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) will be included for the first time.

James Wong, chief executive of Cathaysia Securities, said the latest move by Beijing had brought a “positive atmosphere” to local stock markets.

However, the securities specialist cautioned that such measures may only help in the near future, and that it may take “many more policies” to really improve sentiment.

“All of these [measures] are good. But, for example, the number of ETFs that are allowed is less than 10. I really don't know how much capital flow that 10 ETFs can bring to the Hong Kong market,” he noted.

He also noted that there were only 12 initial public offerings in Hong Kong in the first quarter, and described the figure as “scary”.

Wong expressed the hope that authorities will make it easier for mainland companies to list here.

Meanwhile, Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia, said that Monday's rally came on the back of a combination of factors.

“The sentiment has already improved over the past two months,” said Wen, noting that while the city’s bourse may be able to see more capital inflow following Beijing’s announcement, the “game changer” lies on fundamental factors.

“It depends on many more factors, including China's economic development and whether the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in June or July. These fundamental factors may be more important for foreign or mainland capital - whether they want to come to Hong Kong and buy Hong Kong stocks,” Wen said.]]>
