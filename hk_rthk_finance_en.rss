    <![CDATA[The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Thursday said it had started criminal proceedings against hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its founder, director and chief investment officer Simon Sadler, and former trader Daniel La Rocca for the offence of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company prior to a block trade in June 2017.

In a statement, the SFC said the two defendants appeared at Eastern Magistrates' Court on Thursday and the case was adjourned to June 12.

Sadler, a British businessman, is also the owner of Blackpool Football Club which competes in England's EFL League One division.

Established in 2007, Segantii is one of the oldest and biggest hedge funds in Asia. 

Apart from Hong Kong, it also has operations in London, New York and Dubai, according to its website.

In a statement on its website, Blackpool Football Club said the charges were entirely unrelated to the club, and its day-to-day operations would not be affected.

"We understand that Mr Sadler will vigorously defend himself against the charge, and there will be no further comments at the time from the Club," the statement added. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

    HK logs 'better-than-expected' growth in Q1

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong’s economy grew at a better-than-expected rate of 2.7 percent in the first quarter, partially boosted by the steady rise in exports of goods and services.

However, that growth was lower compared with the 4.3 percent figure seen in the last quarter of 2023, according to official data released by the Census and Statistics Department.

Earlier, the city’s finance chief indicated that first quarter growth would be in line with the projected full-year growth range at between 2.5 and 3.5 percent for 2024.

Commenting on the latest figures, Simon Lee, honorary fellow at Chinese University's Asia-Pacific Institute of Business, said the number was better than expected, but noted the momentum might not be sustainable in the coming quarters.

“My original estimate [for the first quarter] was about one to two percent growth. But the 2.7 percent growth also came on a relatively low base in the first quarter last year when the borders just opened and economic activities were just reactivated,” Lee told RTHK.

“We see that it’s quite remarkable in terms of exports and imports of goods and services [in the first quarter]… but if you look at local consumption… quite a number of local people went elsewhere for spending and this will have a significant effect on the GDP growth.”

“[Although] exports tend to do well at the end of the year, there are also variable factors, such as the economic situation on the mainland and geopolitical issues, so I am still quite cautious on the full-year growth,” he added.

Lee warned Hong Kong could see growth slow to about one or two percent in the coming quarters.

Analysing the major economic components, the growth of private consumption, capital formation, as well as the imports of goods and services all slowed during the three-month period. 

However, exports of goods increased by 6.7 percent year on year, significantly higher compared with the 2.8 percent growth seen in the final quarter of 2023. 

Exports of services rose by a notable 8.1 percent year on year in the quarter, although the pace was much slower compared with the 21.2 percent growth seen in Q4 2023.

“Looking ahead, exports of services should be supported by further revival of inbound tourism alongside the continued recovery of handling capacity and the government's efforts to promote a mega event economy,” a government spokesperson commented.

“Domestically, rising household income and the government's initiatives to boost sentiment should help private consumption, but the changing consumption pattern of residents may pose challenges. [And] a longer period of tight financial conditions may have some dampening effects on economic confidence and activities,” the spokesperson added.]]>

    HKMA again leaves key interest rate unchanged

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday again kept its key interest rate unchanged at 5.75 percent, saying “high rates may last for some time”.

The move by the city’s de facto central bank came in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve which earlier kept its target rate at a two-decade high of between 5.25 and 5.5 percent, citing “hotter-than-expected” price pressures as well as growth reports.

In a statement, HKMA said the Fed “has not yet gained enough confidence about the US inflation trajectory to start cutting interest rates”.

“The high interest rate environment may last for some time,” it added.

The authority said the city’s financial and monetary markets are operating in a smooth and orderly manner, but warned that the interbank offered rate (Hibor) may remain high for the time being. 

“The public should carefully assess and manage the relevant risks when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions,” it said.

HSBC took the lead among the city's banks in leaving its prime lending rate unchanged at 5.875 percent, while keeping interest rates on Hong Kong dollar savings accounts steady.

Meanwhile, the one-month Hibor rate, which is used to price the majority of local mortgages, slightly rose to 4.34 percent, a three-week high.

The three-month Hibor rate, which reflects banks’ funding costs, also rose slightly to a three-week high, at 4.58 percent.

The HKMA and the Fed have kept their key lending rates unchanged since last July, after increasing them 11 times since March 2022.]]>

    Binance chief Zhao jailed for four months

    <![CDATA[Changpeng Zhao, the former chief executive of Binance, was sentenced on Tuesday to four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US laws against money laundering at the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Once considered the most powerful crypto industry figure, Zhao, known as "CZ," is the second major crypto boss to be sentenced to prison.

The sentence imposed by US District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle was significantly shorter than the three years sought by prosecutors, and below the maximum one and a half years recommended under federal guidelines.

It was also much lighter than the 25 years behind bars that Sam Bankman-Fried received in March for stealing US$8 billion from customers of his now-bankrupt FTX exchange. Bankman-Fried is appealing his conviction and sentence.

Still, prosecutors cheered the outcome of what had been a years-long investigation into Binance and Zhao, a billionaire who had been living beyond US reach in the United Arab Emirates.

"This was an epic day,” US Attorney Tessa Gorman told reporters outside the courthouse. “Incarceration was critical in this case and we’re pleased with the result.”

Before handing down the sentence, Jones faulted Zhao for making Binance's growth and profitability a higher priority than complying with US laws.

"You had the wherewithal, the finance capabilities, and the people power to make sure that every single regulation had to be complied with, and so you failed at that opportunity," he said.

Zhao, 47, did not visibly react upon hearing his sentence.

"'Crime pays' is the message sent today," Dennis Kelleher, head of the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets, wrote in an email, noting Zhao will still get to keep his vast wealth.

Prosecutors said Binance employed a "Wild West" model that welcomed criminals, and did not report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups including Hamas, al-Qaeda and Islamic State.

"I'm sorry," Zhao told the judge before being sentenced. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Tuesday following disappointing economic data as US Treasury yields pushed higher ahead of a Federal Reserve decision.

US consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since July 2022, missing expectations amid rising anxiety over the jobs market and future financial conditions.

Analysts also cited an uptick in US Treasury yields following data showing a jump in US employee compensation costs in the first quarter. The rise came as the Fed kicked off a two-day monetary policy meeting.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5 percent to 37,815.

The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.6 percent to 5,035, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 2.0 percent to 15,657. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The number of negative equity cases reached a 20-year high in the first quarter, figures released by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) showed.

According to the HKMA, there were 32,073 cases at the end of March, up 27 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 and the most since the first quarter of 2004.

The HKMA noted that the loans had mainly been taken out by bank staff or linked to mortgage insurance, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio.

Government figures out last week showed home prices rebounded in March, snapping a 10-month losing streak. That's after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech on February 28.]]>

    <![CDATA[Six spot bitcoin and ether exchange traded funds (ETFs) gained in their Hong Kong debut on Tuesday.

The launch of Asia's first cryptocurrency-based ETFs comes three months after a similar move in the United States.

Unlike in the US, however, crypto enthusiasts in Hong Kong can also invest by swapping their own tokens, as well as buying with cash.

After listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange, bitcoin ETFs launched by China AMC, Harvest and Bosera climbed more than 2 percent by midday, while three funds linked to ether were also up. 

Speaking at a launch event, the executive director of the Securities and Futures Commission, Christina Choi, said the ETFs mark a milestone for Hong Kong.

Choi warned would-be investors, however, that virtual assets aren't for everyone.

"Virtual assets themselves are highly speculative and their prices are extremely volatile. bitcoin and ether have in the past experienced a 40 percent drop in a single day and over 60 percent drop within a year," she said.

"Therefore, I would like to remind everyone that virtual assets are not suitable for all investors. Only those who have a thorough understanding of them and can withstand the risks should consider these products."

Meanwhile, the CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, Bonnie Chan, said the ETFs will boost the local market. 

"The listing of six virtual asset ETFs today will further enrich Hong Kong's ETF product offerings. It will attract more investors to participate in the Hong Kong ETF market, enhance market liquidity, promote Hong Kong's development as an attractive ETF market in Asia, and strengthen its competitiveness as an international asset management hub," Chan said.

Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan told the same event that the listings demonstrate Hong Kong's status as a leading virtual assets market in Asia.]]>

    HSBC says chief executive Noel Quinn 'to retire'

    <![CDATA[HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn will retire, the bank said on Tuesday, in a surprise departure from the business that he has overhauled in the past five years through a sweeping series of asset sales across the globe.

The bank said it has already launched a formal process to find a successor, with Chief Financial Officer Georges Elhedery likely the leading internal candidate for the job.

At the same time, HSBC reported a 1.8 percent drop in first-quarter profit as it struggles to cope with rising costs from expansion in Asia and amid inflationary pressures.

Pretax profit came in at US$12.7 billion for the quarter ended March versus US$12.9 billion a year earlier.

The results were better than the US$12.6 billion average of analysts' forecasts compiled by HSBC.

The London-headquartered bank also announced US$3 billion worth of share buybacks on top of US$2 billion in share purchases announced in February. 

Speaking during a media call, Quinn said he informed the group's chairman Mark Tucker of his decision last month, saying he wanted to have a better work-life balance after an "intense" five-year period in the top job.

"I would never have dreamed of being the CEO in the bank 37 years ago and it's a privilege. But you also have to look forward and say what's right for you personally, and I did a lot reflecting on that over Christmas, the New Year, and January," he said.

"I think it's right for me, but also think it's right for the bank, it's a natural transition point for the bank," adding he would work hard to ensure a smooth transition for his successor.

Tucker thanked Quinn for his leadership and for his years of work at the bank, and said he and the board fully "support and respect that decision". (Reuters)

The HSBC group chairman also said the board and its nomination committee hoped to name a new chief executive in the second half of this year.

    <![CDATA[China's manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace in April, an official factory survey showed on Tuesday, suggesting some loss of momentum for the sector at the start of the second quarter.

The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 50.4 in April from 50.8 in March, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and just ahead of a median forecast of 50.3 in a Reuters poll.

The data underlines the challenges facing policymakers even though solid first quarter GDP growth had reduced some of the urgency to ramp up stimulus measures.

New export orders grew at a much slower rate, while employment continued to shrink, the NBS's PMI data showed.

Still, a private Caixin factory survey, which was also released on Tuesday, showed manufacturing activity grew more quickly as new export orders rose, providing a more optimistic outlook than the official data.

Investors expect Beijing to launch more stimulus to support the economy and were waiting for the outcome of a politburo meeting, which is expected to focus on economic affairs this month. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks finished higher on Monday, extending a rally from late last week ahead of a Federal Reserve decision and key earnings reports in the coming days.

A news-jammed week includes Wednesday's Fed decision, where the central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged but will update investors on the prospects for cuts.

Investors will also digest April jobs data, as well as surveys measuring manufacturing sector health and consumer confidence.

"This week has something for everyone," said a note from Charles Schwab.

The Dow Jones advanced 0.4 percent to 38,386.

The S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent to 5,116, while the Nasdaq climbed 0.4 percent to 15,983.

Apple, Coca-Cola and Pfizer are among the large companies reporting quarterly earnings.

Companies in the S&P 500 have thus reported an average of 3.5 percent higher earnings compared with the year-ago period, according to Factset.

Among individual companies, Tesla shot up nearly 15 percent after receiving a key security clearance from the Chinese government for smart cars during a visit to China by Chief Executive Elon Musk.

Apple gained 2.7 percent following an upgrade from equity analysts at Bernstein.

Domino's Pizza jumped 5.6 percent as it reported a 6.1 percent increase in first-quarter sales to US$4.4 billion. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday Hong Kong's GDP growth in the first quarter is expected to be in line with the government's forecast of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent. 

He said the advance estimates for the January-March period, which will be announced on Thursday, would reflect moderate growth for the economy for five straight quarters, dating back to the start of 2023.

"Besides opening up new points for economic growth, we also need to continue to consolidate the traditional elements," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.

He noted the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holidays would attract an estimated 800,000 visitors to Hong Kong, highlighted by a maiden pyrotechnic display at Victoria Harbour on May 1.

The financial secretary said a series of mega events will follow, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, the World Cultures Festival and the Vinexpo Asia for a showcase of wine and spirits late next month.

On stocks, Chan said the Hang Seng Index rose by 8.8 percent in the past week, its best weekly performance in 13 years. 

He attributed the surge to tech shares buoyed by AI and IT developments, as well as stimulus measures by mainland authorities.

Chan added that an updated scheme allowing some mainland residents to buy wealth management products in Hong Kong made tremendous strides last month.

The Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme recorded more than 13.1 billion yuan in transactions in March, which the finance chief said was close to half of the total amount since the scheme's launch in late 2021.]]>

    <![CDATA[US stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent to 38,239, the S&P 500 gained 1 percent to 5,099, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.0 percent to 15,927. 

Investors cheered Alphabet's first-ever dividend, its US$70 billion stock buyback program, and better-than-expected first-quarter results. Its shares jumped to a record high, lifting the Google-parent's market value above US$2 trillion.

Microsoft shares rose after its third-quarter revenue and profit exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by gains from artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across its cloud services. On Wednesday, Meta results had disappointed investors even as the company ratcheted up spending on AI. 

"The earnings reports of Microsoft and Google allayed a lot of the concerns about the fact that the spending on data centers and AI, which Meta had raised a day before, was going to compress margins," said Tom Plumb, president and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds in Madison, Wisconsin. 

"Both Google and Microsoft had indicated that with their current capital plans, they still expected their margins to expand. That allayed a lot of the fears that people had about the growth of data computing," Plumb added.

US Commerce Department data showed monthly inflation rose moderately in March on an annual basis while coming in line with estimates on a monthly basis.

The report offered some relief to financial markets spooked by worries of stagflation a day after data showed inflation surging and economic growth slowing in the first quarter.

After the data, money markets priced in a firmer chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell after the data, last standing at 4.6692 percent  .

Shares of Snap surged after the social media firm beat first-quarter estimates for revenue and user growth. Pinterest shares also finished higher.

Exxon Mobil lost ground after America's largest oil company missed analysts' estimates with first-quarter profit falling 28 percent from a year ago.

Intel dropped after the chipmaker's forecast for second-quarter revenue and profit did not meet estimates. Intel faces weak demand for its traditional data centre and PC chips. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[The US central bank's favoured measure of inflation accelerated last month, according to government data published on Friday, pushing back the chances of an interest rate cut this summer.

The hotter print is likely to cement the view that inflation, while down sharply since 2022, remains a challenge, and could keep the Federal Reserve on pause as it seeks to battle rising prices.

It also complicates US president Joe Biden's re-election message as he seeks to convince sceptical consumers that the economy is heading in the right direction ahead of November's vote.

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in March, up 0.2 percentage points from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said in a statement.

This was above the median forecast of 2.6 percent in a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.

Much of the overall annual rise came from the services sector, which increased at an annual rate of 4.0 percent.

Among the more volatile items, energy prices rose by 2.6 percent from a year ago, while food prices were up 1.5 percent.

"While inflation has fallen more than 60 percent from its peak, today's report reinforces the importance of our ongoing work to bring costs down," White House national economic advisor Lael Brainard said in a statement.

On a monthly basis, PCE inflation rose by 0.3 percent, in line with the figure from February, the Commerce Department said.

The closely watched "core" measure of inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in March, unchanged from a month earlier.

The March figures reaffirm the concern among economists that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than previously thought -- complicating the Federal Reserve's fight to bring it down firmly to its long-term target of two percent through interest rate hikes. (AFP)]]>
