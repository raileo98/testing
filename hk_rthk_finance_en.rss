    US consumer inflation eases slightly to 3.4 percent

    <![CDATA[US consumer inflation eased slightly last month, according to US government data published on Wednesday, a positive sign for President Joe Biden ahead of November's election.

The data supports the Biden administration's messaging that the US economy has turned a corner, as it looks to quell consumers' concerns about the impact of rising prices going into the likely rematch against former president Donald Trump.

The annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.4 percent in April, down 0.1 percentage point from March, the US Labour Department said in a statement.

This was in line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.

Monthly inflation came in at 0.3 percent, slightly below expectations.

The CPI data also helps the US Federal Reserve, which has hiked interest rates to their highest level for 23 years in a bid to bring inflation back down firmly to its long-term target of two percent.

It marks the first month of slowing annual data since January, although both the annual and monthly figures remain too high.

"The index for shelter rose in April, as did the index for gasoline," the Labour Department said in a statement.

"Combined, these two indexes contributed over seventy percent of the monthly increase in the index for all items," it added.

A widely-watched inflation measure excluding volatile food and energy prices also eased last month, rising at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, down from 3.8 percent in March.

The so-called "core" inflation index rose 0.3 percent in April from a month earlier, according to the Labour Department, also slightly lower than in March. (AFP)]]>

    Nasdaq ends at record high ahead of US inflation data

    <![CDATA[The Nasdaq finished at a new record on Tuesday as US stocks rallied, shrugging off data that showed April wholesale inflation that topped expectations.

The tech-focused index closed at 16,511, up 0.8 percent.

The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to 39,558, while the S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to 5,246.

US wholesale prices jumped by 0.5 percent in April, much above estimates in a dynamic that could keep Federal Reserve interest rates higher for longer.

However, analysts noted that the gain was offset by a revision to the March report, which showed wholesale inflation cooling in that period.

"The numbers were more or less in line," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers, who pointed to Wednesday's consumer price report as a key test for stocks.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the first quarter as "notable for its lack of further progress on inflation," adding that "we'll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work."

Among individual companies, Google parent Alphabet rose 0.6 percent as the tech giant highlighted its artificial intelligence offerings at a developer conference.

Home Depot dipped 0.1 percent after reporting a decline in first-quarter revenues as it pointed to "continued softness" in some consumer segments. The home-improvement retailer confirmed its full-year forecast.

GameStop jumped 60.1 percent and AMC Entertainment 32 percent in a revival of the so-called "meme stock" craze from 2021. (AFP)]]>

    US Fed chair says not so confident inflation will ease

    <![CDATA[Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that hot US inflation data has lowered his level of confidence that price rises will slow back down towards the bank's long-term target.

"The first quarter in the United States was notable for its lack of further progress on inflation," the head of the US central bank said during an event in the Netherlands that was streamed online.

"We did not expect this to be a smooth road, but these were higher than I think anybody expected," he continued. "And so what that has told us is we'll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work."

The Fed has held interest rates at a 23-year high as it looks to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target.

After making progress for much of last year, the rate at which consumer prices have been rising has accelerated since the start of 2024, pushing back expectations of interest rate cuts.

Powell said that, while he still expected inflation to move back down towards the levels seen last year, "my confidence in that is not as high as it was having seen these readings in these first three months of the year."

But despite the recent uptick in inflation, Powell said he did not think it was necessary to raise rates from their current "restrictive" levels.

"I don't think it's likely, based on the data that we have, that the next move that we make would be a rate hike," he said.

"I think it's more likely that we'll be at a place where we hold the policy rate where it is," he added. (AFP)]]>

    US raises tariffs on Chinese imports

    <![CDATA[China has spoken out against a move by the United States to hike tariffs on US$18 billion worth of Chinese imports such as electric vehicles (EVs), advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment.

The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminium and more. 

The tariff rate on EVs is set to quadruple to 100 percent this year, the White House said.

Tariffs for semiconductors, meanwhile, will double from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year.

The action is aimed at encouraging China to "eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation," the White House said in a statement.

In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China is opposed to the US tariff hikes and would take measures to defend its interests, urging Washington to cancel the measures.

The Foreign Ministry said it's against unilateral tariff hikes in violation of World Trade Organisation rules.

China "will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests", spokesman Wang Wenbin said.

Xinhua News Agency described it as "a protectionist move widely believed to imperil the American ambition to enhance competitiveness and slash carbon emissions".

The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between US President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[A revival in GameStop and other meme stocks overshadowed a mixed performance in the broader stock market on Monday as a Dow winning streak ended.

Art Hogan, from B. Riley Financial, said the markets are looking ahead to Wednesday's consumer price index report for April.

The market will celebrate signs of moderating inflation, Hogan said, while further signs of intensifying inflation will lead to "the kind of selling pressure that we saw in April."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.2 percent to 39,431, ending an eight-day winning streak.

The S&P 500 was flat at 5,221, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 percent to 16,388.

Monday's light schedule in terms of economic reports continued the sleepy tenor of last week, when stocks climbed on hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.

The inflation report -- along with this week's retail sales data -- will inform expectations about US monetary policy.

Among individual companies, GameStop rocketed 70.9 percent higher while AMC Entertainment surged 80.9 percent. Both benefited from the return to social media of "Roaring Kitty," whose posts helped ignite a massive rally in a handful of stocks in January 2021.

Apple jumped 1.8 percent following a Bloomberg report that the smartphone giant is close to a deal with OpenAI to add ChatGPT to iPhones. (AFP)]]>

    Anglo American rebuffs BHP's revised offer

    <![CDATA[Australian mining giant BHP announced on Monday that British rival Anglo American has rejected an "improved" takeover bid worth £34 billion (almost HK$333.5 billion).

BHP's latest offer, which aims to create the world's biggest-listed copper producer, comes after its initial £31.1-billion approach had already been rebuffed last month.

"The revised proposal was rejected by the Anglo American board on 13 May 2024. BHP is disappointed that the... board has chosen not to engage with BHP with respect to the revised proposal and the improved terms," the company said in a statement.

The new bid was pitched at £27.53 per share, up from £25.08 per share that had been slammed by Anglo as "highly unattractive" and "opportunistic" in April.

BHP has lifted the number of shares that would be given to Anglo investors under the improved terms.

And it still plans to split off Anglo's platinum and iron ore subsidiaries in South Africa, with shares split between the British firm's shareholders.

"BHP put forward a revised proposal to the Anglo American Board that we strongly believe would be a win-win for BHP and Anglo American shareholders," said BHP chief executive Mike Henry.

"We are disappointed that this second proposal has been rejected," he added.

The latest offer would increase Anglo's share of the new combined group to 16.6 percent, up from 14.8 percent previously.

"BHP and Anglo American are a strategic fit and the combination is a unique and compelling opportunity to unlock significant synergies by bringing together two highly complementary, world class businesses," added Henry.

"The combined business would have a leading portfolio of high-quality assets in copper, potash, iron ore and metallurgical coal and BHP would bring its track record of operational excellence to maximise returns from these high-quality assets."

In mid-afternoon deals on the London stock market, Anglo American's share price slid 0.8 percent to £27.51, while BHP dipped 0.6 percent to £22.83. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Unionized workers at a Maryland Apple store voted on Saturday to authorize a strike, which would mark the first such labour action against the retailer in the United States if it goes forward.

Employees at the Apple store in the town of Towson, near Baltimore, voted to unionise in 2022 -- another first for the iPhone maker's US stores.

But a contract has yet to be agreed upon.

"Following over a year of negotiations with Apple management that yielded unsatisfactory outcomes," union members are "signaling their collective demand for meaningful change," a union statement said.

"The issues at the forefront of this action include concerns over work-life balance, unpredictable scheduling practices disrupting personal lives, and wages failing to align with the area's cost of living."

The Towson store has about 100 employees. A majority of them were required to vote for the result to be valid.

The next negotiation meeting is scheduled for May 21, though a strike could come before that.

Meanwhile, employees at another of the California-based company's stores, in New Jersey, voted down a unionisation effort over the weekend.

In a statement to CNN, Apple said it would "engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith."

The National Labor Relations Board, the federal labour regulator, has received numerous complaints against Apple, accusing it of trying to discourage staff from unionising.

US tech companies in general are seen as hostile toward unionisation efforts -- particularly Amazon.

In September, nearly a quarter of Apple store employees in France went on strike the day the iPhone 15 launched, demanding a pay raise at least equal to inflation. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[US stocks eked out modest gains on Friday and all three indexes posted another weekly advance as investors parsed comments from Federal Reserve officials and looked ahead to crucial inflation figures next week.

The S&P 500 and the Dow were modestly higher and the Nasdaq ended essentially unchanged. All three indexes were up for the week with the blue-chip Dow nabbing its largest Friday-to-Friday percentage advance since mid-December.

Commentary from several Fed officials helped set expectations as market participants looked toward next week's inflation data.

"Nobody really wants to take a big position prior to next week," said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. "And we’re getting into a time of year where people seem to slip out early on Fridays."

"The biggest story is the decline in Consumer Sentiment, but outside of that there isn't much to hang your hat on," Carlson added.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic acknowledged recent clues the economy is slowing, but added the timing of rate cuts remains uncertain.

Striking a more hawkish tone, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said it was unclear whether monetary policy was tight enough to bring inflation down to the central bank's 2 percent target.

Hints of progress toward that target will come next week when the Labour Department releases its Consumer and Producer price indexes (CPI and PPI).

Analysts expect the crucial CPI report to show underlying "core" price of 3.6 percent year-on-year, which would be the coolest reading in over three years.

"The Fed is geared not to raise rates but cut them, so 'higher for longer' is about as dire as it's going to unless things really fall off the table," said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor & market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest in Elmhurst, Illinois.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32 percent, to 39,513, the S&P 500 gained 0.16 percent, to 5,223 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.03 percent, to 16,341.

Nvidia gained 1.3 percent after TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker and a major supplier to Nvidia, reported a near 60 percent jump in April sales.

Novavax shares surged 98.7 percent in the wake of the vaccine maker's licensing deal worth up to US$1.2 billion with Sanofi. SoundHound AI jumped 7.2 percent after beating first-quarter revenue estimates. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks climbed on Thursday as economic data raised hopes that the US central bank is on track for interest rate cuts later this year.

The Dow Jones rose 0.9 percent to 39,387, while the S&P 500 jumped 0.5 percent to 5,214.

The Nasdaq added 0.3 percent to 16,346.

The gains came after initial jobless claims rose to the highest level since last August, to 231,000 for the week ending May 4.

A higher level of claims – if the trend persists – could be seen as a sign of the labour market cooling down, giving the Federal Reserve impetus to lower interest rates.

Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital said the higher unemployment claims has helped bond markets. US Treasury bond yields, a proxy for interest rates, moved lower.

While rate cuts will depend on subsequent inflation data, he added: "We are seeing some cracks in the labour market and when that happens, that eventually leads to slow economic activity."

Meanwhile, the Bank of England kept interest rates at a 16-year high but signalled it could cut rates over the summer.

Among companies reporting results, Warner Bros. Discovery closed 3.1 percent up while Arm Holdings slumped by 2.3 percent.

Airbnb shares slid by 6.9 percent. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks moved sideways on Thursday following mixed earnings reports as weekly US jobless claims pushed higher.

The jump in initial jobless claims by 22,000 to 231,000 puts the benchmark at the highest level since last August, according to Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.

The data "will be construed as a sign of softening in the labour market," O'Hare said. "That view, in turn, will be construed as a possible trigger for a Fed rate cut in coming months."

The data came as the Bank of England kept interest rates at a 16-year high but signalled it could cut rates over the summer.

About 25 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones was up 0.1 percent at 39,098.

The S&P 500 was unchanged at 5,186, while the Nasdaq declined 0.3 percent to 16,262.

Among companies reporting results, Warner Brothers Discovery advanced 2.0 percent, Arm Holdings dropped 6.3 percent and Airbnb fell 7.2 percent. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The head of the city's stock exchange operator on Thursday said average daily trading turnover was improving, paving the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) in the SAR. 

Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said trading volume towards the end of April had reached up to HK$150 billion, and that turnover during the Golden Week holiday period remained strong at over HK$110 billion when mainland markets were closed with reduced capital flows to the territory.

"The stock market's rebound means that we have regained the confidence of investors. This certainly helps more IPOs to get listed smoothly and successfully in Hong Kong," she told reporters. 

She said the number of IPO applications received by the bourse in the first quarter of this year was 30 percent more than in the same period in 2023, with around 100 currently waiting to be listed. 

Chan also noted that many firms had expressed interest after the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced new measures to facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms. 

Leading mainland companies would list in Hong Kong in the near future, which could boost the city's market, she added.]]>

    <![CDATA[China's exports and imports grew in April as domestic and global demand picked up, giving a boost to the world's second-biggest economy. 

Figures from the General Administration of Customs show that exports grew 1.5 percent from April last year, in line with analysts' expectations, after contracting sharply to 7.5 percent in March.

Imports in April surged 8.4 percent – nearly double market estimates – after falling by 1.9 percent in the previous month. 

Meanwhile, imports from the United States jumped by nine percent, while exports fell by nearly three percent.

China's trade surplus rose to US$72.35 billion from US$58.55 billion in March. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[The friendship between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia has blossomed since SAR officials visited the Middle Eastern country two years ago, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said on Thursday. 

At the Capital Markets Forum, co-organised by the Hong Kong and Saudi bourses, Wong said the two territories are discussing an investment promotion and protection deal and a number of organisations have signed memoranda of understanding on issues ranging from dispute avoidance and resolution to artificial intelligence. 

He also pointed out that the SAR provides a fundraising platform for Saudi Arabian businesses to expand, serves as a springboard to access the mainland Chinese market, and offers opportunities to allocate offshore renminbi assets. 

Wong stressed that the SAR and Saudi Arabia can help each other achieve their "ambitious goals in finance and well beyond". 

"Saudi Arabia has clear and ambitious goals for the development of its financial markets, and it's cultivating a diversified and efficient financial sector that contributes to realising the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030," he said. 

"Hong Kong, meanwhile, is an international financial centre, with a highly open and internationalised market and a regulatory regime that is aligned with major overseas markets. We adopt the best practices in the world... With our advanced capital markets, Hong Kong can be Saudi Arabia's partner and best friend."

He also revealed that the SAR administration is considering setting up an economic and trade office in Saudi Arabia, and that Cathay Pacific will resume direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and Riyadh in the fourth quarter of this year. 

The new CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Bonnie Chan, told the same event that the SAR and Saudi Arabia have been working closely together. 

"The HKEX has been playing its role by building more connectivity between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia's capital markets," she said. 

"We have signed a [memorandum of understanding] with Saudi Tadawul Group. We have added the Saudi exchange as one of our recognised stock exchanges. We listed the world's largest and Asia's first Saudi ETF on our markets, an important first step in enabling Hong Kong investors to get to know to the Saudi market."

Deputy Minister of Investment Development in Saudi Arabia, Saleh Al-Khabti, said Hong Kong could be more involved in the kingdom's development, as Riyadh aims to invest US$3.2 trillion into its economy by 2030.

"One thing that's very important is I believe we don't see enough participation from the Hong Kong financial sector and the role it can play to facilitate for China and the rest of Asia, becoming part of that beautiful story we have," he said.]]>
