    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks regained lost ground on Friday to trade higher ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend, with renewed enthusiasm for generative AI-linked companies pushing Nvidia's share price.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished the day up 1.1 percent to 16,920, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 5,304.

The Dow Jones stabilised after tumbling on Thursday to close almost unchanged at 39,069.

While stocks often rise ahead of the Memorial day weekend, Friday's buoyant trading day also had Nvidia's recent streak to thank, said Tom Cahill from Ventura Wealth Management.

The company, which sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) used in many generative AI products, saw its share price rise 2.6 percent on Friday, leaving it up more than 15 percent this week.

"We know that expectations were very high, and yet they seem to meet or exceed them on more than one level," he said. "So whether we like it or not, artificial intelligence now is an important factor when it comes to the stock market sentiment."

"And to the extent that Nvidia's numbers were able to meet or beat expectations that's supportive for the market," he added.

Other tech companies that saw their share price jump on Friday include Advanced Micro Devices, which closed up 3.7 percent, and Intel, which finished 2.1 percent higher. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks finished sharply lower on Thursday after blowout earnings by Nvidia failed to ignite a broad rally.

Stocks had opened higher, but analysts cited an uptick in US Treasury bond yields as a driver of the reversal. Market watchers also noted a tendency in equities to sell off after big rallies.

"You've had huge runs since mid-April and there's an inclination to take some money off the table," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.

The Dow Jones finished down 1.5 percent at 39,065.

The S&P 500 slid 0.7 percent to 5,267, while the Nasdaq declined 0.4 percent to 16,736.

Among individual companies, artificial intelligence player Nvidia surged 9.3 percent after reporting a net profit of US$14.9 billion, while its revenue of US$26 billion was almost four times what it took in during the same fiscal quarter last year.

Live Nation Entertainment dropped 7.8 percent after the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit, arguing the company, which owns ticketing behemoth Ticketmaster, should be broken up.

Boeing plunged 7.6 percent after the company's CFO predicted another quarter of meagre plane deliveries, likely resulting in negative cash for all of 2024.

Retail company VF, which owns Timberland and other outdoor apparel brands, fell 2.9 percent after reporting a US$418.3 million loss in the most recent quarter. The company said a turnround is on track. (AFP)]]>

    US sues to dismantle Ticketmaster-owner Live Nation

    <![CDATA[The US Department of Justice filed a major antitrust lawsuit on Thursday seeking to break up the alleged monopoly held by Live Nation Entertainment and its Ticketmaster subsidiary in the live music industry.

The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in New York, alleges that Live Nation has abused its dominant market position to raise ticket fees, squeeze out competitors and limit choices for fans, venues and artists.

"Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators," said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement.

"It is time to break up Live Nation."

Ticketmaster's pricing practices for concerts and sports events, with high fees and lack of alternatives, have long been a political issue in the United States, with little done historically to open up the market to more competition.

The latest controversy over Ticketmaster's dominance came when tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras tour went on pre-sale in November 2022.

Widespread outages and exorbitant fees caused an uproar, with lawmakers in Washington holding hearings to question Live Nation-Ticketmaster executives over the debacle.

The move by US officials against Live Nation also came as the Biden administration, according to polls, is seen by voters as failing to do enough to curb inflation.

High prices have become a key issue in battleground states ahead of the 2024 election that pits Biden against former president Donald Trump.

In a statement, Live Nation said the lawsuit "won't solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows."

"Calling Ticketmaster a monopoly may be a PR win for the DOJ in the short term, but it will lose in court because it ignores the basic economics of live entertainment," it added.

Live Nation, which merged with Ticketmaster in 2010, has grown into a US$22 billion global giant that produces over 30,000 concerts annually for nearly 500 touring artists across its network of over 265 venues in North America.

The company has fought back against allegations it harms the ticketing industry, saying it brought innovation and lower prices because of its national reach.

But the DOJ counters that US fans still pay higher fees with "outdated technology" compared to other countries.

The lawsuit detailed allegations of unlawful tactics by Live Nation to maintain its dominance, including "threatening and retaliating against venues" by signalling they could lose concerts and revenue if they work with rivals.

The 68-page suit paints Live Nation-Ticketmaster as operating a "self-reinforcing business model" that allows it to capture revenue from ticket sales and then use that revenue to lock up artists to exclusive promotion deals.

It then leverages its access to top performers to sign venues into long-term exclusive ticketing deals.

Fights against Ticketmaster's power go back to the 1990s, when the rock band Pearl Jam refused to perform at Ticketmaster venues in protest at its service charges that increased ticket prices.

Ticketmaster was accused of organising a boycott of Pearl Jam's tour, and the band eventually gave up its campaign against the ticketing giant. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Tech giant Nvidia easily beat Wall Street estimates as its profits and revenues skyrocketed, boosted by its chipmaking dominance which has made the company an icon of the artificial intelligence boom.

Its net income rose more than sevenfold compared to a year earlier, jumping to US$14.88 billion in its first quarter that ended April 28 from US$2.04 billion a year earlier. 

Revenue more than tripled, rising to US$26.04 billion from US$7.19 billion in the previous year.

“The next industrial revolution has begun,” CEO Jensen Huang declared on a conference call with analysts. 

Huang predicted that the companies snapping up Nvidia chips will use them to build a new type of data centre he called “AI factories” designed to produce “a new commodity — artificial intelligence.”

Huang added that training AI models was becoming a faster process as they learn to become “multimodal” — that is, capable of understanding text, speech, images, video and 3-D data — and also “to reason and plan.”

The company reported earnings per share — adjusted to exclude one-time items — of US$6.12, well above the US$5.60 that Wall Street analysts had expected. 

Shares in Nvidia Corp rose 6 percent in after-hours trading to US$1,006.89. 

The company’s stock has risen more than 200 percent in the past year. (AP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday following mixed earnings reports as Federal Reserve meeting minutes highlighted inflation worries.

Equities spent much of the day essentially flat, but tripped into the red after the Fed minutes showed that policy makers were frustrated with the lack of progress in bringing inflation towards the central bank's two percent target.

Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare said the concerns were unsurprising given the mindset of the Fed at the May 1 meeting, but that the release served as an excuse for investors to sell after a big rally since the meeting.

The Dow Jones finished down 0.5 percent at 39,671.

The S&P 500 shed 0.3 percent to 5,307, while the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent to 16,801, pulling back after two straight records.

Among individual companies, Target slumped 8.0 percent after reporting a drop of 3.7 percent in comparable sales in the first quarter. The big-box retailer characterised the results as being in line with expectations.

Lululemon Athletica dropped 7.2 percent after announcing a number of executive reassignments following the departure of Chief Product Officer Sun Choe, who is leaving for another career opportunity.

But Moderna surged 13.7 percent after announcing that it had been cleared to present abstracts at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, which begins on May 31 in Chicago. (AFP)]]>

    US home sales slip on still high mortgage rates

    <![CDATA[Existing home sales in the United States crept lower in April as mortgage rates remained elevated, industry data showed on Wednesday.

Sales of previously owned homes dipped by 1.9 percent from March, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million, said the National Association of Realtors (NAR).

Analysts had expected a slight uptick last month.

"Home sales changed little overall, but the upper-end market is experiencing a sizeable gain due to more supply coming onto the market," NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.

Total housing inventory at the end of April was up nine percent from March, and was 16.3 percent higher than the same period a year ago.

Mortgage rates have surged in recent years as the Federal Reserve rapidly hiked the benchmark lending rate to tackle stubborn inflation.

For now, the central bank continues to hold rates steady as it seeks to stamp out price increases.

As of May 16, the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.02 percent, up from 6.39 percent a year prior, according to home loan finance firm Freddie Mac.

In mid-May 2021, the rate was around three percent.

Higher rates have weighed on transactions, as homeowners who locked in lower rates previously remained reluctant to enter the market.

From a year ago, home sales were also 1.9 percent lower in April, NAR data showed.

The median sales price in April rose 5.7 percent from a year ago to US$407,600 – the highest since June 2023.

Looking ahead, however, "the pace of price increases should taper off since more housing inventory is becoming available," Yun said.

Mortgage demand is expected to remain tepid in the near term, given that long-term rates are still elevated, analysts from Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a recent note.

"We expect a decline in long-term rates over the next couple of months, but we also expect the labour market will start to look much weaker, slowing the growth in the pool of potential homebuyers," Pantheon added. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Nasdaq climbed to a fresh record on Tuesday following a choppy session after a smattering of mixed earnings and muted Federal Reserve commentary.

"There really isn't much economic news to speak of," said Cresset Capital's Jack Ablin, who pointed to Wednesday's earnings report from Nvidia as one of the highlights of the week.

Shares of Nvidia rose 0.6 percent.

Fed governor Christopher Waller welcomed last week's consumer price index report that showed moderating inflation, while adding that "several" months of additional data were needed before interest rates should be cut.

The tech-rich Nasdaq finished at 16,832, up 0.2 percent for the day and a record for the second straight session.

The Dow Jones also advanced 0.2 percent to 19,872, along with the S&P 500, which stood at 5,321.

Cresset's Ablin said the stock market is probably "overbought" at this point, adding that, "relative to bonds, the stock market is probably the most expensive it's been since the financial crisis."

All three major indices scored records last week following data showing a moderation in inflation.

Among individual companies, Lowe's dropped 1.9 percent after earnings topped analyst expectations. However, revenues for the home-improvement retailer fell about four percent to US$21.4 billion.

Trump Media & Technology Group slumped 8.7 percent after reporting a net loss of US$327.6 million in the quarter ending March 31.

Disney nudged up 0.1 percent following news the company's animation studio Pixar is laying off about 14 percent of its staff. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks dipped early on Tuesday, edging back from recent records following muted Federal Reserve commentary and mixed earnings.

Fed governor Christopher Waller welcomed last week's consumer price index report that showed moderating inflation, while adding that "several" months of additional data were needed before interest rates should be cut.

Among companies reporting results, Macy's climbed after its report, while both Lowe's and Palo Alto Networks pulled back.

About 15 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones was essentially flat at 39,824.

The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 5,305, while the Nasdaq declined 0.3 percent to 16,749, retreating from Monday's all-time high.

"Markets are hunting for catalysts and drifting as they wait," said a note from Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.

Among individual companies, Lam Research rose 1.1 percent after the semiconductor company announced a stock split and the authorisation of up to US$10 billion in share repurchases. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Gains by several large tech companies pushed the Nasdaq to a fresh record on Monday, on an overall mixed day for US equities as weakness at JPMorgan Chase dragged down the Dow.

Microsoft climbed 1.2 percent as it unveiled new PC offerings that feature generative artificial intelligence tools built directly into its Windows operating system.

Chip giant Nvidia also advanced ahead of its earnings release due later this week.

But JPMorgan slumped 4.5 percent, with analysts attributing the decline to CEO Jamie Dimon signalling he is closer to retiring from the US banking giant.

The tech-focused Nasdaq rose 0.7 percent to 16,794, topping last week's record.

The Dow Jones, meanwhile, slid 0.5 percent to 39,806, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent to 5,308.

Besides Nvidia earnings, this week's calendar includes Federal Reserve minutes from the May 1 meeting.

"It's a mixed session," said Peter Cardillo, of Spartan Capital. "I kind of think it's going to be this way until some new catalyst."

Results from some leading retailers, including Target and Lowe's, are also on this week's plate. Strong results from Walmart last week added to market momentum.

Among other equities, tech company Jabil shot up 5.2 percent after announcing that Michael Dastoor was promoted from chief financial officer to chief executive officer. The company also confirmed its profit forecast. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said while the macro-economy and investment sentiment have improved in recent months, not all industries in Hong Kong are recovering at the same pace. 

Writing on his weekly blog, Chan noted that local stocks traded near nine-month highs earlier this month and home prices rebounded in March after a 10-month fall, but he acknowledged that retailers and restaurant operators still face challenges.

"Indeed, the recovery is still uneven among different industries. The retail and catering sectors are still adapting to the challenges brought by changes in the consumption patterns of residents and tourists," he wrote.

"In response to market changes, we take the initiative and strive to create more favourable market conditions and atmospheres. We work with the business community to create new opportunities of growth for Hong Kong."

Chan added that the government will announce shortly mega events planned for the second half of the year.

He vowed to create tourism experiences with unique characteristics of the SAR to boost consumption.]]>
