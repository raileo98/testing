    US stocks go sideways as jobless claims rise

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks moved sideways on Thursday following mixed earnings reports as weekly US jobless claims pushed higher.

The jump in initial jobless claims by 22,000 to 231,000 puts the benchmark at the highest level since last August, according to Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.

The data "will be construed as a sign of softening in the labour market," O'Hare said. "That view, in turn, will be construed as a possible trigger for a Fed rate cut in coming months."

The data came as the Bank of England kept interest rates at a 16-year high but signalled it could cut rates over the summer.

About 25 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones was up 0.1 percent at 39,098.

The S&P 500 was unchanged at 5,186, while the Nasdaq declined 0.3 percent to 16,262.

Among companies reporting results, Warner Brothers Discovery advanced 2.0 percent, Arm Holdings dropped 6.3 percent and Airbnb fell 7.2 percent. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The head of the city's stock exchange operator on Thursday said average daily trading turnover was improving, paving the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) in the SAR. 

Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said trading volume towards the end of April had reached up to HK$150 billion, and that turnover during the Golden Week holiday period remained strong at over HK$110 billion when mainland markets were closed with reduced capital flows to the territory.

"The stock market's rebound means that we have regained the confidence of investors. This certainly helps more IPOs to get listed smoothly and successfully in Hong Kong," she told reporters. 

She said the number of IPO applications received by the bourse in the first quarter of this year was 30 percent more than in the same period in 2023, with around 100 currently waiting to be listed. 

Chan also noted that many firms had expressed interest after the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced new measures to facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms. 

Leading mainland companies would list in Hong Kong in the near future, which could boost the city's market, she added.]]>

    <![CDATA[China's exports and imports grew in April as domestic and global demand picked up, giving a boost to the world's second-biggest economy. 

Figures from the General Administration of Customs show that exports grew 1.5 percent from April last year, in line with analysts' expectations, after contracting sharply to 7.5 percent in March.

Imports in April surged 8.4 percent – nearly double market estimates – after falling by 1.9 percent in the previous month. 

Meanwhile, imports from the United States jumped by nine percent, while exports fell by nearly three percent.

China's trade surplus rose to US$72.35 billion from US$58.55 billion in March. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[The friendship between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia has blossomed since SAR officials visited the Middle Eastern country two years ago, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said on Thursday. 

At the Capital Markets Forum, co-organised by the Hong Kong and Saudi bourses, Wong said the two territories are discussing an investment promotion and protection deal and a number of organisations have signed memoranda of understanding on issues ranging from dispute avoidance and resolution to artificial intelligence. 

He also pointed out that the SAR provides a fundraising platform for Saudi Arabian businesses to expand, serves as a springboard to access the mainland Chinese market, and offers opportunities to allocate offshore renminbi assets. 

Wong stressed that the SAR and Saudi Arabia can help each other achieve their "ambitious goals in finance and well beyond". 

"Saudi Arabia has clear and ambitious goals for the development of its financial markets, and it's cultivating a diversified and efficient financial sector that contributes to realising the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030," he said. 

"Hong Kong, meanwhile, is an international financial centre, with a highly open and internationalised market and a regulatory regime that is aligned with major overseas markets. We adopt the best practices in the world... With our advanced capital markets, Hong Kong can be Saudi Arabia's partner and best friend."

He also revealed that the SAR administration is considering setting up an economic and trade office in Saudi Arabia, and that Cathay Pacific will resume direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and Riyadh in the fourth quarter of this year. 

The new CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Bonnie Chan, told the same event that the SAR and Saudi Arabia have been working closely together. 

"The HKEX has been playing its role by building more connectivity between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia's capital markets," she said. 

"We have signed a [memorandum of understanding] with Saudi Tadawul Group. We have added the Saudi exchange as one of our recognised stock exchanges. We listed the world's largest and Asia's first Saudi ETF on our markets, an important first step in enabling Hong Kong investors to get to know to the Saudi market."

Deputy Minister of Investment Development in Saudi Arabia, Saleh Al-Khabti, said Hong Kong could be more involved in the kingdom's development, as Riyadh aims to invest US$3.2 trillion into its economy by 2030.

"One thing that's very important is I believe we don't see enough participation from the Hong Kong financial sector and the role it can play to facilitate for China and the rest of Asia, becoming part of that beautiful story we have," he said.]]>

The Shanghai Composite Index was also flat, ticking a third of a point lower to 3,128, while the Shenzhen Composite Index on the mainland's second exchange slid a quarter of a point to 1,773. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks moved in opposite directions on Wednesday, digesting another round of mixed earnings in a quarter that has seen solid but unspectacular corporate results.

"I think that companies did a nice job of outpacing their Q1 expectations. But I did notice that earnings estimates for the year for 2024 really haven't changed much," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, adding that companies aren't reporting "much earnings growth."

The Dow Jones finished up 0.4 percent at 39,056.

The S&P 500 was flat at 5,187, while the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent to 16,302.

Stocks finished little changed on Tuesday after three up days in which markets embraced Federal Reserve comments that further interest rate hikes were unlikely.

A handful of prominent earnings reports have commanded focus in a week with few major economic reports following last week's heavy calendar that included April jobs data and a Federal Reserve decision.

Among individual companies, Uber dropped 5.7 percent after reporting a US$654 million loss, while rival ride-hailing company Lyft jumped 7.1 percent after topping estimates, saying it sees solid demand growth.

Also higher was Reddit, which advanced 3.9 percent as it posted a 48 percent jump in revenues to US$243 million. The social media company said higher costs were driven by expenses for its initial public offering. (AFP)]]>

    FTX says customers will be repaid for losses

    <![CDATA[Customers of failed cryptocurrency platform FTX will be made whole on the assets they lost when the company collapsed in 2022, it announced on Wednesday.

The plan "contemplates the centralised distribution to customers and other creditors around the world of virtually all of the assets associated with FTX at the time of its collapse in November 2022," said a statement released by FTX Trading LTD.

Total distributions to customers will be between US$14.5-US$16.3 billion. FTX said the plan still must be approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court.

"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100 percent of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors," said John Ray III, chief executive and chief restructurings officer of FTX.

FTX said it garnered the funds "by monetising an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets," mostly investments held by the company and affiliates and litigation claims.

Another factor was the resolution of claims against the firm, including some US$24 billion that had been sought by the Internal Revenue Service for the period prior to the Chapter 11 filing.

To resolve the IRS cases, FTX will instead pay US$200 million in cash and US$685 million to be paid out after other claims.

The plan also will pay out interest of up to nine percent, FTX said. What won't be included will be the appreciation in value that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have enjoyed since November 2022.

FTX collapsed suddenly following a deluge of customer withdrawals.

The company's chief architect, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison following a conviction of fraud and other financial crimes. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Auto-giant Toyota doubled its net profit in the fiscal year that ended in March, as strong vehicles sales and a favorable exchange rate lifted results for Japan’s top carmaker.

Toyota on Wednesday said its annual profit totaled 4.9 trillion yen, up from 2.45 trillion yen the year before, while its sales jumped 21 percent to 45 trillion yen. 

The results exceeded Toyota’s own projection for a 4.5 trillion yen profit, as its global sales surged to 9.4 million vehicles from 8.8 million vehicles in the previous fiscal year.

Sales of hybrids performed well, although Toyota stressed it was working hard to offer various kinds of electric vehicles, including battery EVs, plug-ins and fuel cell models.

The company expects to sell 9.5 million vehicles during this fiscal year, with sales projected to grow in the US and the rest of Asia.

Toyota said it will make key investments in areas such as research on technology in coming months to sustain long-term growth.

It expects its net profit for the fiscal year through to March 2025 to decline nearly 28 percent to 3.57 trillion yen, with spending also covering investments in workers at suppliers and dealers it called “human capital.”

“The latest results show that our efforts have borne fruit, but we need keep growing with the vision to become a mobility company,” Chief Executive Koji Sato told reporters. 

The auto industry is undergoing a sweeping transformation away from old-style gasoline engines, especially in markets like China, where EVs dominate and some analysts say automakers like Toyota may have fallen behind. (AP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks finished a choppy session essentially flat on Tuesday, a sideways performance that could persist until investors digest significant economic releases later in the month.

"The market might just be due for some pause, consolidation," said LBBW's Karl Haeling.

Analysts pointed to light trading volume in a comparatively quiet period of news after last week saw major earnings reports, economic releases and a Federal Reserve decision.

Upcoming potential catalysts include US consumer price data and Walmart results, both of which are scheduled for next week.

The Dow Jones edged up 0.1 percent to 38,884.

The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 5,187, while the Nasdaq dipped 0.1 percent to 16,332.

Among individual companies, Disney dropped 9.5 percent as it reported a small quarterly loss and pointed to a moderation in travel spending expected to weigh on results at its parks division.

Apple advanced 0.4 percent after unveiling new versions of its iPad tablets.

Spirit AeroSystems, a major contractor to Boeing and Airbus, fell 0.3 percent as it reported a US$616.7 million quarterly loss, reflecting a drag from lower output amid Boeing's quality control problems.

The company has also so far not reached a pricing agreement with Airbus, further weighing on financial performance. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive, John Lee, on Tuesday called on the financial sector to enhance cooperation with the mainland, after the nation’s securities regulator introduced measures to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) last month unveiled five measures to promote coordinated development between the capital markets of the mainland and Hong Kong.

These measures included relaxing eligibility criteria for exchange-traded fund products in the Stock Connect mechanism, as well as the inclusion of real estate investment trusts for the first time. The CSRC also said it would facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms, and loosen rules on stock trading links between exchanges in the SAR and the mainland.

Delivering his speech to over 200 business leaders prior to a closed-door discussion on enhancing collaboration between the financial markets in Hong Kong and the mainland, Lee said cross-border cooperation will bring in more business opportunities.

"Further integration and development with the mainland financial markets will help leverage Hong Kong's international advantages and enhance the competitiveness of the mainland financial market, attracting more capital and businesses. This will drive economic development and will allow people to share in the fruits of progress," he said.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting with business leaders, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the SAR government is still in negotiations with mainland authorities on the implementation of the CSRC's measures.

Chan noted that these measures would allow international investors to use Hong Kong as a gateway to access mainland equity markets.

"Hong Kong is the national springboard for mainland capital and investors seeking overseas opportunities, and thereby provides a very convenient and very familiar platform for overseas investors to go through Hong Kong to participate in the mainland equity market," he added.

The Securities and Futures Commission’s CEO Julia Leung, meanwhile, told reporters that the measures are expected to be implemented as early as the third quarter.]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks advanced on Monday, extending a rally on hopes for possible Federal Reserve interest rate cuts soon after weaker US jobs data.

US stocks were in positive territory the whole session as analysts pointed to Friday's jobs report showing weaker than expected employment growth.

A note from Charles Schwab characterised the report as "perfect" in terms of being in "not too hot and not too cold territory," while adding that "it's just one set of numbers and there's a risk that the market may overreact."

The Dow Jones finished at 38,852 up 0.5 percent.

The S&P 500 rose 1.0 percent to 5,180, while the Nasdaq climbed 1.2 percent to 16,349.

Major indices have risen the last three days.

Among individual companies, Paramount Global gained 3.1 percent following a New York Times report that it entered into talks with a bidding group led by Sony Pictures and Apollo after negotiations between Paramount and Skydance didn't produce a deal.

Tyson Foods slid 5.7 percent as it reported slightly lower revenues and projected flat sales in the upcoming quarter. Executives said inflation was pinching low-income consumers.

    <![CDATA[The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Eddie Yue, on Monday urged banks to be prepared to operate during severe weather conditions. 

Yue told reporters that Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) is making progress towards ensuring local stock and derivatives markets can still function during adverse weather.

“Hong Kong Exchanges is now finalising the arrangement and we have asked the banks to make sure that they get prepared, so that whatever the final arrangement is they will be able to support it and we have asked them to make early preparations for example on if there should be any system change,” he said.

Yue's remarks follow the completion of a public consultation exercise by HKEX in January on ending stock market closures during severe weather events. 

Separately, Yue said the HKMA will host the third Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit from November 18 to 20, adding that around 50 to 60 people have confirmed their attendance.

The HKMA chief said he hopes the summit will attract prominent business figures to Hong Kong and will strengthen the city’s position as an international financial hub.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Monday said its Exchange Fund posted an investment gain of HK$54.3 billion in the first quarter of this year, despite the underwhelming performance of local stock markets. 

It was the second consecutive quarter of gains for the fund, whose primary role is to back the Hong Kong dollar. 

During a panel meeting in the Legislative Council, the HKMA revealed that the fund lost HK$2.3 billion in local equities in the first quarter and lost HK$4.8 billion on its foreign exchange assets. 

However, these were offset by gains of HK$25.1 billion from bond investments and HK$36.3 billion from other stocks.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said the future performance of the fund remains uncertain.

“The uncertainty about the US interest rate path, which will depend on the path of inflation in the US... we will still need to see the incoming economic data and see where the inflation path in the US will go, and see whether they will, as the market is expecting now, defer the rate cut decision and also the pace may be a little slower than expected before,” he explained. 

Yue also said tensions in the Middle East and the pace of economic recovery in mainland China contribute additional uncertainty to the performance of the Exchange Fund.]]>
