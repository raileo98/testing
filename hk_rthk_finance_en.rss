    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said while the macro-economy and investment sentiment have improved in recent months, not all industries in Hong Kong are recovering at the same pace. 

Writing on his weekly blog, Chan noted that local stocks traded near nine-month highs earlier this month and home prices rebounded in March after a 10-month fall, but he acknowledged that retailers and restaurant operators still face challenges.

"Indeed, the recovery is still uneven among different industries. The retail and catering sectors are still adapting to the challenges brought by changes in the consumption patterns of residents and tourists," he wrote.

"In response to market changes, we take the initiative and strive to create more favourable market conditions and atmospheres. We work with the business community to create new opportunities of growth for Hong Kong."

Chan added that the government will announce shortly mega events planned for the second half of the year.

He vowed to create tourism experiences with unique characteristics of the SAR to boost consumption.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Dow Jones finished above 40,000 points for the first time on Friday, as stocks were mixed on Wall Street at the end of the trading week.

The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to finish at 40,003.

The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 percent at 5,303, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent to 16,685.

But despite the slight decline in the Nasdaq, all three major indexes still finished the week higher than they were at the start of it.

"We made a breakout to new record high," said Karl Haeling from LBBW.

"The market is just choosing to consolidate, which is probably a healthy thing," he continued. "Because it's racing and getting too exuberant."

Among individual companies, petrochemical producer Valero Energy finished the day up 4.8 percent, while the mining company Freeport McMoRan was up 4.2 percent.

One of the day's big losers was Paramount Global, which saw its share price fall 4.9 percent. (AFP)]]>

    E-CNY pilot scheme expanded to HK for the first time

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Friday announced that a pilot electronic renminibi programme had been expanded to Hong Kong to include cross-border usage of the digital currency. 

It marks the first time since the launch of the e-CNY pilot scheme in 2019 that the nation's official digital currency was available for use outside of the mainland.

The programme, backed by Beijing, allows Hong Kong residents to open digital yuan wallets using a local mobile number via an app developed by China's central bank - the People's Bank of China.

The expansion of the programme permits users to make payments in retail shops and some online stores in Hong Kong, Macau and other Greater Bay Area cities as well as in other places covered by the pilot scheme.

Hongkongers who use the e-CNY wallets can pay up to 2,000 yuan for each transaction, and are limited to use up to 50,000 yuan worth of purchases per year. 

The apps are operated by four mainland banks, namely Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank as well as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, while users can top up their e-CNY wallets from 17 banks, including HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and Standard Chartered Bank. 

Speaking at a press briefing, the authority's deputy chief executive, Howard Lee, said the expansion of the pilot scheme would make it more convenient for Hongkongers to shop on the mainland.

"This is going to provide an additional means, a safe and secure means for people in Hong Kong to use this wallet across the border when they go there and they have a need to make a payment, or vice versa for mainland users coming to Hong Kong," he explained.

"There are already some other means that can be used for this purpose, but we thought that different people might have different preferences, so one more option is always better than one fewer option."

However, Hong Kong users currently cannot make peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, or electronic money transfers from oneself to another through the e-CNY wallets.]]>

    <![CDATA[Beijing on Friday announced some of its most sweeping measures yet to stabilise and revive the country's beleaguered property sector, allowing local governments to buy "some" apartments, relaxing mortgage rules and pledging further efforts to deliver unfinished homes.

Earlier, fresh data showed the fastest drop in new home prices in more than nine years, highlighted continued problems for an industry which at its peak accounted for a fifth of economic activity and remains a major drag on confidence and growth.

Vice Premier He Lifeng told an online meeting with other authorities that municipal governments could buy homes at "reasonable" prices.

The homes would be used to provide affordable housing, He said. 

The vice premier also said local governments could repurchase land sold to developers, and promised authorities would "fight hard" to complete stalled projects.

Separately, the People's Bank of China said it would further lower mortgage interest rates and down-payment requirements.

Shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers soared following the announcement. (Agencies)]]>

    HK court delays Country Garden hearing till June

    <![CDATA[The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition on Friday seeking the liquidation of Chinese property giant Country Garden. 

The decision provides some relief to the embattled developer amid Beijing's efforts to revive the crisis-hit property sector.

A Hong Kong firm filed the petition against Country Garden in February for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. The developer defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds last year and is in the process of an offshore debt restructuring.

Country Garden applied for the adjournment to prepare more evidence. The request was not opposed by the petitioner which filed the action against the company.

If Country Garden is able to present progress on the debt restructuring talks with its offshore creditors, it would help the developer push back against the liquidation petition.

A key group of creditors, the ad hoc group of bondholders, have signalled their "neutral stance" towards the liquidation petition, according to the petitioner's lawyer. 

In a letter to the court, the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing the ad hoc group, said they no longer intended to appear in the court.

The hearing into the petition comes against the backdrop of Beijing stepping up efforts to revive the property sector, which slipped into an unprecedented debt crisis in mid-2021.

Over the past few years, a growing list of developers has defaulted on debt repayment obligations and a handful of them, including China Evergrande, have been ordered to be liquidated. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Reddit has partnered with OpenAI to bring its content to popular chatbot ChatGPT, the companies said on Thursday, sending the social media platform's shares up 12 percent in extended trade.

The deal underscores Reddit's attempt to diversify beyond its advertising business, and follows its recent partnership with Alphabet to make its content available for training Google's AI models.

ChatGPT and other OpenAI products will use Reddit's application programming interface, the means by which Reddit distributes its content, following the new partnership.

OpenAI will also become a Reddit advertising partner, the company said.

Ahead of Reddit's March IPO, Reuters reported that Reddit struck its deal with Alphabet, worth about US$60 million per year.

Investors view selling its data to train AI models as a key source of revenue beyond Reddit's advertising business.

The social media company earlier this month reported strong revenue growth and improving profitability in the first earnings since its market debut, indicating that its Google deal and its push to grow its ads business were paying off.

Reddit's shares rose 10.5 percent to US$62.31 after the bell. As of Wednesday's close, the stock is up nearly 12 percent since its market debut in March. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks finished modestly lower on Thursday, retreating from a record run that included the Dow's first ever rise above 40,000 points.

The Dow lingered above that level for hours before ending slightly lower.

"We had a big move yesterday in response to data that were friendly for the Fed," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.

"Today there was this absence of any major catalyst," he said. "With stocks at all-time highs, I think taking a breather is healthy."

The Dow Jones finished down 0.1 percent at 39,869.

The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent to 5,297, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.3 percent to 16,698.

All three indices finished at records on Wednesday following data showing a cooling in US inflation that raised hopes of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

Among individual companies, Walmart shot up 7.0 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits as the retail giant pointed to gains from wealthier consumers.

But Deere & Company dropped 4.7 percent as it projected broad-based 2024 sales declines in light of a tough operating environment in the farming economy. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks surged to fresh records on Wednesday after data showed a moderation in US consumer prices in April, boosting the chances for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

All three major indices rocketed to fresh all-time highs after monthly US consumer prices came in slightly below expectations, with annual inflation at 3.4 percent in April, down 0.1 percentage points from March.

The Dow Jones gained 0.9 percent to 39,908, putting it back within striking distance of a first-ever close above 40,000 points.

The S&P 500 jumped 1.2 percent to 5,308, while the Nasdaq advanced 1.4 percent to 16,742, notching a second straight record.

Retail sales were flat in April, missing estimates for a 0.4 percent increase.

The reports together "point to a cooling of inflation and economic growth, as well as an increase in the likelihood that the Fed will begin its rate-cutting cycle later this year," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research.

US stocks rallied in the first quarter on expectations for interest rate cuts, but hit obstacles later in the spring as Fed officials pushed back the timeframe for easing.

Among individual companies, Dell surged 11.2 percent after Morgan Stanley analysts lifted their price target on the technology company, highlighting its artificial intelligence offerings.

Boeing slumped 2.1 percent after the Department of Justice said the company had breached a 2021 criminal settlement, potentially leading to criminal prosecution.

GameStop and AMC Entertainment tumbled following two days of gains that prompted talk of a revived "meme stock" craze. GameStop dropped 18.9 percent, while AMC lost 20 percent. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[US consumer inflation eased slightly last month, according to US government data published on Wednesday, a positive sign for President Joe Biden ahead of November's election.

The data supports the Biden administration's messaging that the US economy has turned a corner, as it looks to quell consumers' concerns about the impact of rising prices going into the likely rematch against former president Donald Trump.

The annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.4 percent in April, down 0.1 percentage point from March, the US Labour Department said in a statement.

This was in line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.

Monthly inflation came in at 0.3 percent, slightly below expectations.

The CPI data also helps the US Federal Reserve, which has hiked interest rates to their highest level for 23 years in a bid to bring inflation back down firmly to its long-term target of two percent.

It marks the first month of slowing annual data since January, although both the annual and monthly figures remain too high.

"The index for shelter rose in April, as did the index for gasoline," the Labour Department said in a statement.

"Combined, these two indexes contributed over seventy percent of the monthly increase in the index for all items," it added.

A widely-watched inflation measure excluding volatile food and energy prices also eased last month, rising at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, down from 3.8 percent in March.

The so-called "core" inflation index rose 0.3 percent in April from a month earlier, according to the Labour Department, also slightly lower than in March. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Nasdaq finished at a new record on Tuesday as US stocks rallied, shrugging off data that showed April wholesale inflation that topped expectations.

The tech-focused index closed at 16,511, up 0.8 percent.

The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to 39,558, while the S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to 5,246.

US wholesale prices jumped by 0.5 percent in April, much above estimates in a dynamic that could keep Federal Reserve interest rates higher for longer.

However, analysts noted that the gain was offset by a revision to the March report, which showed wholesale inflation cooling in that period.

"The numbers were more or less in line," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers, who pointed to Wednesday's consumer price report as a key test for stocks.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the first quarter as "notable for its lack of further progress on inflation," adding that "we'll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work."

Among individual companies, Google parent Alphabet rose 0.6 percent as the tech giant highlighted its artificial intelligence offerings at a developer conference.

Home Depot dipped 0.1 percent after reporting a decline in first-quarter revenues as it pointed to "continued softness" in some consumer segments. The home-improvement retailer confirmed its full-year forecast.

GameStop jumped 60.1 percent and AMC Entertainment 32 percent in a revival of the so-called "meme stock" craze from 2021. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that hot US inflation data has lowered his level of confidence that price rises will slow back down towards the bank's long-term target.

"The first quarter in the United States was notable for its lack of further progress on inflation," the head of the US central bank said during an event in the Netherlands that was streamed online.

"We did not expect this to be a smooth road, but these were higher than I think anybody expected," he continued. "And so what that has told us is we'll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work."

The Fed has held interest rates at a 23-year high as it looks to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target.

After making progress for much of last year, the rate at which consumer prices have been rising has accelerated since the start of 2024, pushing back expectations of interest rate cuts.

Powell said that, while he still expected inflation to move back down towards the levels seen last year, "my confidence in that is not as high as it was having seen these readings in these first three months of the year."

But despite the recent uptick in inflation, Powell said he did not think it was necessary to raise rates from their current "restrictive" levels.

"I don't think it's likely, based on the data that we have, that the next move that we make would be a rate hike," he said.

"I think it's more likely that we'll be at a place where we hold the policy rate where it is," he added. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[China has spoken out against a move by the United States to hike tariffs on US$18 billion worth of Chinese imports such as electric vehicles (EVs), advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment.

The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminium and more. 

The tariff rate on EVs is set to quadruple to 100 percent this year, the White House said.

Tariffs for semiconductors, meanwhile, will double from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year.

The action is aimed at encouraging China to "eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation," the White House said in a statement.

In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China is opposed to the US tariff hikes and would take measures to defend its interests, urging Washington to cancel the measures.

The Foreign Ministry said it's against unilateral tariff hikes in violation of World Trade Organisation rules.

China "will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests", spokesman Wang Wenbin said.

Xinhua News Agency described it as "a protectionist move widely believed to imperil the American ambition to enhance competitiveness and slash carbon emissions".

The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between US President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China. (Agencies)
