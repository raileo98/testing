    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks rose for a second straight session on Tuesday, building on the prior day's positive momentum following a round of mostly good corporate earnings.

General Electric, Spotify Technology and Kimberly-Clark were among the companies winning strong gains after quarterly reports.

Briefing.com described the broad gains as "follow-through buying" after a rough period that generated talk that the market was "oversold" on a short-term basis.

The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,503.

The S&P 500 advanced 1.2 percent to 5,070, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.6 percent to 15,696.

After last week's losses, US stocks began the week on Monday on a solid note, advancing amid relief that there was no escalation in tensions between Iran and Israel over the weekend.

Among individual companies, General Motors shot up 4.4 percent as it lifted its full-year forecast following better than expected quarterly earnings. The automaker continued to point to solid pricing in the United States, which helped offset weakness in China.

GE Aerospace gained 8.3 percent after lifting its projections after reporting an uptick in orders and operating profit.

But JetBlue sank 18.9 percent as it projected lower revenues in the second quarter, noting that there is "significant elevated capacity" in the company's Latin region, pressuring results. (AFP)]]>

    London's FTSE strikes record as global sentiment lifts

    <![CDATA[London's FTSE 100 stocks index hit record highs on Tuesday, catching up with major global peers that have struck all-time peaks this year as inflation cools.

Sentiment was upbeat across major world indices thanks to easing Middle East worries and hopes of interest-rate cuts, while traders are keenly awaiting the release this week of more major earnings and key US inflation data.

London's FTSE 100 reached 8,076 points shortly after the open, surpassing a record 8,047 struck in February last year, though it pared down gains in afternoon deals.

"Good news as this is, it does highlight the sluggishness of the UK's top equity index when compared to its US and European competitors which hit a string of successive records throughout the first quarter of 2024," said David Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services provider Trade Nation.

But, he added, "let's not be too churlish as it could be we see the FTSE outperform its rivals in the years to come should investors seek out dividend paying value stocks rather than techy growthy ones."

The index has in recent weeks been lifted by a weakening of the pound, particularly against the dollar, as markets anticipate cuts to UK interest rates in the coming months thanks to slowing price rises.

A weaker pound benefits FTSE-listed British multinationals that make big earnings in foreign currencies. Sterling gained against the dollar and euro on Tuesday after falling earlier in the day.

The Paris and Frankfurt stock markets won a lift from news of an improvement to business activity in the eurozone this month.

Wall Street opened higher on a busy week on the corporate front, with investors keenly awaiting first-quarter earnings from Elon Musk's Tesla later in the day.

The electric car maker, which enjoyed scorching growth for most of 2022 and 2023, has experienced setbacks that analysts say have raised the stakes for the first-quarter report. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's inflation rate slightly rose in March, with the Composite Consumer Price Index up two percent on a year earlier. 

That compared to the 1.9 percent inflation rate in the previous two months. 

Figures released by the Census and Statistics Department showed that underlying inflation, stripping out short-term relief measures, was also up marginally in March, at one percent.

Alcohol and tobacco prices surged nearly 18 percent year-on-year, while meals out and takeaways were up 3.3 percent and housing costs rose 3.1 percent. 

Electricity, gas and water prices dropped 8.7 percent. 

A government spokesperson said the underlying price inflation was “modest” in March, noting that prices of basic foods edged down.

“Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay contained in the near term. Domestic costs may face some upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain on a broad downward trend, though heightened geopolitical tensions will bring uncertainties,” the spokesperson added. 

For the first quarter of 2024, overall consumer prices rose 1.9 percent year-on-year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks powered higher on Monday, shrugging off recent weakness at the start of a heavy week of earnings from technology and industrial companies.

"The markets are breathing a collective sigh of relief that the tensions in the Middle East didn't escalate," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments.

Stocks tumbled on Friday, in part due to selling ahead of the weekend amid fears of a worsening in the Israel-Iran conflict.

The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,239.

The S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent to 5,010, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.1 percent to 15,451.

All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 finished in positive territory.

This week's earnings calendar includes results from tech titans such as Amazon and Microsoft, as well as from industrial companies including Chevron and General Motors.

Tesla, which also reports this week, fell 3.4 percent following another round of price cuts – the latest sign of intensifying competition among electric vehicle manufacturers.

Verizon dropped 4.6 percent as analysts cited worries about a soft demand picture, with net broadband subscriber additions slowing compared with the prior quarter.

Nike slid 0.4 percent after disclosing to state officials in Oregon that it plans to cut 740 jobs from its headquarters. (AFP)]]>

    'More efforts needed to revive stock market sentiment'

    <![CDATA[Financial analysts on Monday said that a pledge by the nation’s securities regulator to offer support in enhancing Hong Kong's role as a global financial hub can provide a short-term boost to market sentiment, but more measures are needed.

Shares on the Hang Seng Index and Tech Index enjoyed a bump after the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on Friday said it would facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms, and loosen rules on stock trading links between exchanges in the SAR and on the mainland.

Under the measures, the scope of eligible exchange-traded funds (ETFs) via the links will be widened, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) will be included for the first time.

James Wong, chief executive of Cathaysia Securities, said the latest move by Beijing had brought a “positive atmosphere” to local stock markets.

However, the securities specialist cautioned that such measures may only help in the near future, and that it may take “many more policies” to really improve sentiment.

“All of these [measures] are good. But, for example, the number of ETFs that are allowed is less than 10. I really don't know how much capital flow that 10 ETFs can bring to the Hong Kong market,” he noted.

He also noted that there were only 15 initial public offerings in Hong Kong in the first quarter, and described the figure as “scary”.

Wong expressed the hope that authorities will make it easier for mainland companies to list here.

Meanwhile, Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia, said that Monday's rally came on the back of a combination of factors.

“The sentiment has already improved over the past two months,” said Wen, noting that while the city’s bourse may be able to see more capital inflow following Beijing’s announcement, the “game changer” lies on fundamental factors.

“It depends on many more factors, including China's economic development and whether the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in June or July. These fundamental factors may be more important for foreign or mainland capital - whether they want to come to Hong Kong and buy Hong Kong stocks,” Wen said.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Nasdaq sank more than two percent on Friday following a poor investor response to Netflix earnings that exacerbated worries over next week's deluge of earnings from tech giants.

The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 2.1 percent at 15,282, with Netflix sinking 9.1 percent and artificial intelligence leader Nvidia losing 10 percent.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 percent to 37,986, and the S&P 500 declined 0.9 percent to 4,967.

Netflix reported a profit of US$2.3 billion, topping earnings expectations on a jump in subscribers. The drop appeared to be tied to commentary about the current quarter which suggested growth was moderating.

The results come ahead of reports next week from other key tech names, including Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft.

"The way Netflix has responded has created some consternation about the mega stocks' ability to live up to expectations," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, who cited downcast comments from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company earlier in the week as a driver of Friday's poor showing by chip stocks.

Stocks have had a rough week due in part to unease over the Middle East and shifting expectations on US monetary policy, with traders betting the US central bank will delay cutting interest rates.

Among other companies reporting results, American Express jumped 6.2 percent after reporting a 34 percent increase in quarterly profits to US$2.4 billion.

    <![CDATA[Tesla is recalling 3,878 Cybertruck vehicles because of a defect that can cause unintentional vehicle acceleration, increasing crash risk, according to a US notice posted this week.

Tesla notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on April 17 of the condition in which the accelerator pedal may become trapped on the Cybertruck, Elon Musk's futuristic take on the American pickup truck.

If the accelerator pedal becomes trapped, "the performance and operation of the pedal will be affected, which may increase the risk of a collision," Tesla said in the notice.

Tesla said it was not aware of any collisions or injuries related to the condition. The company will replace or rework the accelerator to address the issue, the company said.

Musk has championed the Cybertruck, declaring at a launch event last November that "Finally, the future will look like the future!"

But the vehicle's use of large flat plates of unbent stainless steel poses challenges in manufacturing. Musk has said it will take time to ramp up production, targeting 2025 as the year when output will reach 250,000 a year.

Earlier this week, Tesla announced it would lay off more than 10 percent of its global workforce as it contends with rising competition among electric vehicle producers and slowing demand growth in some markets. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[When Vincent Yuan, a resident of Hebei province on the mainland, wanted to get something nice for his wife, he bought a piece of golden gourd jewellery, spending about 28,000 yuan at a local jewellery shop.

There was also some strategic thinking behind the 35-year-old general manager’s decision, adding he bought the jewellery because he believes there’s real value to be gained from investing in the precious yellow metal.

“People like buying stuff which sees its value go up and not down, so if prices keep going up, we’ll of course buy more, and vice versa, if prices go down, then we won’t buy.”

“Gold is like a go-to preference for Chinese people,” he added.

His wife, Catrina Xu, 30, is also a fan of gold jewellery. 

On a trip to Hong Kong last year, the only souvenir Xu purchased were gold items — a bracelet from a jewellery store in Tsim Sha Tsui and a necklace when she visited Hong Kong Disneyland.

“Since then, prices have gone up a lot over the past nine months,” she noted.

The pair were among thousands of mainland Chinese shoppers who see the precious metal as a safe-haven investment to hedge against devaluation amid economic uncertainties as property prices in the country fall and its stock markets slump.

Since December last year, retail prices for gold from China’s major brands have risen 21 percent to a multi-year high of over 730 yuan (US$100) per gram as of April 12, from the 600 yuan (US$82) range seen in December.

In New York, bullion prices notched another record close on April 15, with the most-active June contract for gold futures settling at US$2,383 per ounce.

“I have been surprised by the strength in gold that we've seen since the start of 2024,” said John Reade, chief market strategist at the World Gold Council.

The bullion veteran said while the Chinese retail buying spree had been a major contributor to the global gold price spikes, other drivers included tensions in the Middle East, and speculative buyers on the Comex futures market in New York, which lifted prices higher over the past six weeks.

Comex is the leading platform for trading futures contracts on precious and base metals, such as gold, silver, and copper.

“This is very much an emerging market phenomena led by China - together with speculative buying [on Comex].”

“As has been the incredible purchases by central banks, which has been going on for nearly two years now," Reade said, noting that global central banks had ramped up their gold purchases in 2022 and 2023, to diversify their foreign reserves and reduce their dependency on US dollars.

According to the council's 2023 annual report, about one fourth of global central banks intend to increase their holdings of gold this year.

The People’s Bank of China, in particular, regained the crown for the largest single gold buyer in 2023, as it reported a total rise of 225 tonnes in its gold reserves over the year, marking its highest level of annual buying since at least 1977.

“And all the indications are that it’s continued,” Reade added.

American bank Citi on Tuesday forecast that gold is set to reach US$3,000 an ounce over the next six to 18 months.

The lender noted the start of US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts - or a potential recession - would further drive demand for gold.

Another financial giant, Goldman Sachs, last Friday referred to the “unshakeable bull market” in gold and upgraded its price target for the precious metal to US$2,700 an ounce by the end of this year.

“We would expect gold to benefit from interest rate cuts if and when they materialise in the United States and other important markets. That's likely to help gold performance,” Reade agreed.

But he cautioned that the metal tends to deliver returns that are only around three percent higher than US inflation in the long term.

“I would say US$3,000 an ounce over the next six to 18 months could be quite a stretch from where we are now… That said, there’s certainly the ingredients in place for the strength that we’ve seen in gold to continue for the next year or two,” adding that prices could still be volatile in the short term.]]>

    <![CDATA[L'Oreal's chief executive gave a cautious outlook about China, the world's No. 2 beauty market, on Thursday even after the cosmetics maker reported first-quarter sales growth of more than 6 percent for the country.

The first-quarter performance in China was well above sector growth of 1 percent, Nicolas Hieronimus told analysts in a call after the French cosmetics giant that owns the Maybelline and Lancome brands released better-than-expected first-quarter sales.

Even so, he is not banking on any major improvement in consumer confidence.

"We plan with, I would say, a China that is not doing fantastic, and we make the most of the opportunities in Europe, in emerging (markets) and gaining share in North America," he said.

"And if China accelerates, it will be a positive news on our own expectations."

Demand for mass market products in China has accelerated during the quarter to a greater extent than in the United States, he said.

The make-up market has slowed the most in North America, although fragrance is doing "great", he said in the call. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks finished mostly lower on Thursday after another volatile session as rising US Treasury bond yields reflected dimming hopes for an imminent pivot in the Fed's monetary policy.

"Price action feeds on itself," Karl Haeling of LBBW said of the lacklustre session. "People see the market going down and they say, 'Get me out.'"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.1 percent gain at 37,775.

But the S&P 500 dipped 0.2 percent to 5,011, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.5 percent to 15,601.

The market's current posture towards pullbacks contrasts with the approach earlier in the year when investors eagerly stepped in to buy equities during periods of weakness.

Analysts attribute the shift in large part to the growing expectation that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates fewer times, if at all, in 2024, than was initially expected.

Among individual companies, Netflix fell 0.4 percent ahead of its release of quarterly results. The company reported better-than-expected profits of $2.3 billion after the market closed.

The streaming giant is the first major tech company to report this quarter. Other giants, such as Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta, are scheduled to report next week.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company fell 4.9 percent, citing "weakening macroeconomic conditions" and softening demand. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's unemployment rate rose to 3 percent in three-month period ending in March, according to official figures released on Thursday. 

That's a 0.1 percentage point increase compared with the December-to-February period. 

Another 9,400 people became jobless during the first quarter of 2024, with officials noting that there were 111,700 unemployed persons in the three-month period ending in March. 

Meanwhile, the underemployment rate edged up slightly to 1.1 percent. 

In a statement, Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rate was generally low despite the uptick. 

"The unemployment rates of most sectors increased in January - March 2024 compared with the preceding three-month period, but stayed low in general," he said. 
 
"As the economy continues to grow, the labour market will likely remain tight in the near term."]]>
