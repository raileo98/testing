    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday Hong Kong's GDP growth in the first quarter is expected to be in line with the government's forecast of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent. 

He said the advance estimates for the January-March period, which will be announced on Thursday, would reflect moderate growth for the economy for five straight quarters, dating back to the start of 2023.

"Besides opening up new points for economic growth, we also need to continue to consolidate the traditional elements," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.

He noted the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holidays would attract an estimated 800,000 visitors to Hong Kong, highlighted by a maiden pyrotechnic display at Victoria Harbour on May 1.

The financial secretary said a series of mega events will follow, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, the World Cultures Festival and the Vinexpo Asia for a showcase of wine and spirits late next month.

On stocks, Chan said the Hang Seng Index rose by 8.8 percent in the past week, its best weekly performance in 13 years. 

He attributed the surge to tech shares buoyed by AI and IT developments, as well as stimulus measures by mainland authorities.

Chan added that an updated scheme allowing some mainland residents to buy wealth management products in Hong Kong made tremendous strides last month.

The Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme recorded more than 13.1 billion yuan in transactions in March, which the finance chief said was close to half of the total amount since the scheme's launch in late 2021.]]>

    <![CDATA[US stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent to 38,239, the S&P 500 gained 1 percent to 5,099, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.0 percent to 15,927. 

Investors cheered Alphabet's first-ever dividend, its US$70 billion stock buyback program, and better-than-expected first-quarter results. Its shares jumped to a record high, lifting the Google-parent's market value above US$2 trillion.

Microsoft shares rose after its third-quarter revenue and profit exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by gains from artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across its cloud services. On Wednesday, Meta results had disappointed investors even as the company ratcheted up spending on AI. 

"The earnings reports of Microsoft and Google allayed a lot of the concerns about the fact that the spending on data centers and AI, which Meta had raised a day before, was going to compress margins," said Tom Plumb, president and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds in Madison, Wisconsin. 

"Both Google and Microsoft had indicated that with their current capital plans, they still expected their margins to expand. That allayed a lot of the fears that people had about the growth of data computing," Plumb added.

US Commerce Department data showed monthly inflation rose moderately in March on an annual basis while coming in line with estimates on a monthly basis.

The report offered some relief to financial markets spooked by worries of stagflation a day after data showed inflation surging and economic growth slowing in the first quarter.

After the data, money markets priced in a firmer chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell after the data, last standing at 4.6692 percent  .

Shares of Snap surged after the social media firm beat first-quarter estimates for revenue and user growth. Pinterest shares also finished higher.

Exxon Mobil lost ground after America's largest oil company missed analysts' estimates with first-quarter profit falling 28 percent from a year ago.

Intel dropped after the chipmaker's forecast for second-quarter revenue and profit did not meet estimates. Intel faces weak demand for its traditional data centre and PC chips. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[The US central bank's favoured measure of inflation accelerated last month, according to government data published on Friday, pushing back the chances of an interest rate cut this summer.

The hotter print is likely to cement the view that inflation, while down sharply since 2022, remains a challenge, and could keep the Federal Reserve on pause as it seeks to battle rising prices.

It also complicates US president Joe Biden's re-election message as he seeks to convince sceptical consumers that the economy is heading in the right direction ahead of November's vote.

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in March, up 0.2 percentage points from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said in a statement.

This was above the median forecast of 2.6 percent in a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.

Much of the overall annual rise came from the services sector, which increased at an annual rate of 4.0 percent.

Among the more volatile items, energy prices rose by 2.6 percent from a year ago, while food prices were up 1.5 percent.

"While inflation has fallen more than 60 percent from its peak, today's report reinforces the importance of our ongoing work to bring costs down," White House national economic advisor Lael Brainard said in a statement.

On a monthly basis, PCE inflation rose by 0.3 percent, in line with the figure from February, the Commerce Department said.

The closely watched "core" measure of inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in March, unchanged from a month earlier.

The March figures reaffirm the concern among economists that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than previously thought -- complicating the Federal Reserve's fight to bring it down firmly to its long-term target of two percent through interest rate hikes. (AFP)]]>

    ByteDance says 'no plans' to sell TikTok

    <![CDATA[Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok after a new US law put it on a deadline to divest from the hugely popular video platform or have it banned in the United States.

Tech publication, The Information, earlier reported that ByteDance is exploring scenarios for selling TikTok's US business without the algorithm that recommends videos to TikTok users. ByteDance denied it was considering a sale.

"Foreign media reports about ByteDance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue," the company posted on Thursday on Toutiao, a Chinese-language platform it owns.

"ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok."

TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew said on Wednesday the social media company expects to win a legal challenge to block legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden that he said would ban its popular short video app used by 170 million Americans.

The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the US Senate on Tuesday, is driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or use the app for surveillance.

Biden's signing sets a January 19 deadline for a sale – one day before his term is poised to expire – but he could extend the deadline by three months if he determines privately owned ByteDance is making progress. (AFP/Reuters)]]>

    Home prices rebound after 10-month fall

    <![CDATA[Home prices rebounded in March, rising one percent month-on-month and ending a 10-month falling streak.

Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department showed that the official private flat price index edged up to 305.7, from 302.5 in February.

However, prices were still more than 13 percent lower on a yearly basis and 23 percent lower than the all-time high recorded in 2021.

Rents also edged up in March, rising 0.5 percent on a monthly basis, or 5.6 percent on an annual basis, following a two-month falling streak.

The increases came after the government lifted all remaining property cooling measures in the budget in late February.

“The city’s property market has seen a revenge-style rebound after the lifting of the cooling measures, as the buyers’ sentiment noticeably improved,” said Martin Wong, director and head of research & consultancy, Greater China, at Knight Frank Hong Kong.

“However, prices of lived-in homes may continue to weaken due to the impact of sales of new homes. And as the interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve may also come later than the markets anticipated, meaning the city may start cutting rates from late third quarter, the high rates may continue weighing on the market.”

Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at Colliers Hong Kong, struck a cautious note on the property price outlook due to surging supplies and an uncertain path for interest rate cuts, saying she expects a five to 10 percent fall over the year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks closed lower on Thursday as markets were stunned by data showing slower-than-expected US economic growth and persistent inflation, coupled with a sell-off in large cap stocks triggered by disappointing results from Meta Platforms.

Data on Thursday showed that the US economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly two years in the first quarter while inflation accelerated, dampening hopes that the Federal Reserve would begin cutting interest rates this year.

Disappointing results from Meta, whose shares plunged nearly 11 percent, also weighed on market sentiment. Three other Magnificent Seven stocks, including Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft, finished lower.

However, shares of Alphabet and Microsoft were advancing in extended hours trading after both companies reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates. Intel forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below market estimates, sending its shares down 8 percent in extended hours trading.

"The GDP numbers definitely puts a ding in the paradigm that markets were hanging onto for equities in terms of high growth; and if you don't have high growth that will translate to lower-than-expected earnings," said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in California.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.98 percent, to 38,086, the S&P 500 lost 0.46 percent, to 5,048 and the Nasdaq lost 0.64 percent, to 15,612.

Separately, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to still tight labour market conditions. The March Personal Consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is due on Friday.

"The double whammy was also the inflation number that came in stronger than expected so there wasn't really a silver lining in that report; it's still positive in absolute terms but relative to high expectations it was disappointing," St. Aubin added.

International Business Machines fell 8 percent after it announced a US$6.4 billion deal to buy HashiCorp alongside its first-quarter results, in which revenue missed estimates.

Southwest Airlines slid nearly 7 percent as the carrier slashed its projections for new aircraft deliveries from Boeing in 2024 for the third time. Caterpillar shed 7 percent after it cut second quarter sales forecasts as demand for its construction equipment eases from last year's boom. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's exports increased 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, according to official figures released on Thursday.

Despite a slight decline in February, exports picked up 4.7 percent in March on a year-on-year basis, resulting in an overall surge for the quarter. 

Exports to Thailand saw the largest expansion, followed by those to the United Arab Emirates and the mainland, while shipments to the Netherlands dropped in the first three months of the year. 

Meanwhile, imports saw 8 percent year-on-year growth in the quarter. 

In a statement, a government spokesperson said uncertainty remains in the city's exports performance. 

"Looking ahead, geopolitical tensions and a longer period of tight financial conditions will continue to affect Hong Kong's export performance, though the slightly better-than-expected external demand may provide some support," the spokesperson said.]]>

    New tools needed to reduce FX risks: ABAC

    <![CDATA[The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) on Thursday called for new tools to reduce foreign exchange risks due to concerns about widening interest rate differentials between the United States and emerging economies. 

It also urged greater digitisation of the trade process to boost economic integration within the Asia Pacific region.

Speaking at the end of a four-day meeting in Hong Kong, Tom Harley, an Australian ABAC member, said the council was studying an exchange rate tool known as a World Parity Unit which might be able to reduce foreign exchange risks.

The unit represents an exchange rate between a basket of currencies from developed countries and those from emerging markets.

“[So] rather than borrowing in US dollars and just having a single-currency risk, it borrows against a basket of world currencies, and it has the potential to reduce currency risk in cross-border borrowing, particularly for the energy transition, by up to 25 percent,” Harley noted.

“We are now working on how it can be implemented... to deal with a critical problem,” he added.

The proposal comes as a strong US dollar, due to interest rates that have held steadily higher over a longer than expected period, continues to weigh on currencies in the Asia Pacific region, posing foreign exchange risks. 

This concern was shared by Hiroshi Nakaso, ABAC’s Japanese member, who chairs the council’s finance and investment task force.

The former deputy governor of the Bank of Japan also called for greater efforts in promoting digitisation of the entire trade process in the Asia Pacific region to enhance economic integration.

“Currently many parts of the trade process, if not all, are conducted on a manual or paper basis, such as letter of credit or insurance policy. So this is incurring huge losses, opportunity costs, for the regional economy.” 

“The initiatives that I mentioned are intended to digitalise the entire trade process, so that the cost and the time required can be greatly reduced and help regional economic integration,” Nakaso said. 

Separately, Frank Ning, a China member who chairs ABAC's sustainability working group, called for a green free trade framework in the Asia Pacific to tackle climate change, noting that business groups in the region also wanted the trade environment to be improved - in the wake of rising Sino-US tensions.

“We have a very strong proposal between the Chinese delegation and the US delegation on ABAC to have a sustainable supply chain, which demonstrates the strong will from business to see an improved free trade environment.”

“We want to see that back. We do not want to see a confrontational or trade barrier type of policy,” Ning said.

Other key proposals include the empowerment of women in trade, boosting women’s participation in green trade and venture capital, noted Julia Torreblanca, the council’s chair for 2024.

The council, an advisory body to APEC economic leaders, held a meeting in Hong Kong between April 22 and 25, to promote free trade in the Asia Pacific region, with some 200 delegates in the city for the first time since 2015.]]>

    <![CDATA[The benchmark S&P 500 closed higher in choppy trading on Wednesday, as investors weighed an uptick in Treasury yields amid positive corporate results particularly from technology giants.

An auction of a record US$70 billion worth of five-year US Treasury notes on Wednesday helped to push bond yields higher and had weighed on equities. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose five basis points to 4.6459 percent.

The Dow finished lower while the Nasdaq ended higher.

Investors were also focused on quarterly earnings from companies, especially from megacap growth stocks. Shares of Meta Platforms fell 11 percent in extended hours trading after the tech giant reported that its capital expenditure could reach up to US$40 billion in 2024, even as its first quarter revenue beat estimates.

Microsoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their results later this week.

Tesla jumped 12 percent after the electric vehicle maker's plans to boost production and roll out more affordable models overshadowed its weak quarterly results.

"My biggest concern is the bond market, particularly the long end of the US yield curve," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.

The S&P 500 gained 0.02 percent to 5,072 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.10 percent, to 15,713. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11 percent, to 38,461.

Markets are eyeing first quarter gross domestic product data on Thursday and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for March on Friday. Hotter-than-expected consumer price inflation report for March had pushed back expectations of when the Fed will begin cutting interest rates.

Shares of Boeing fell 2.8 percent after the planemaker reported its first quarterly revenue drop in seven quarters, even though the result beat analyst expectations.

Solar inverter maker Enphase Energy dropped 5.5 percent after projecting second-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.

The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.

The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.

Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.

Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.

Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The outgoing chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Laura Cha, on Wednesday said the city’s stock exchange operator would continue to go “international” as it considered all options to stimulate market turnover.

This came as Cha hosted her last annual general meeting with shareholders before stepping down from the role she held over the past six years after reaching a two-term limit.

Speaking at the meeting, Cha, 74, said the city’s bourse would continue developing connectivity with other exchanges in the world.

“With regard to our international development, it’s not going to stop, it will continue,” Cha said.

“It’s not just about opening two [new] offices. Over the past year we have done a lot of work, we have also signed expressions of interest with two exchanges elsewhere, so that we will also be able to broaden the scope of listing to move forward,” she added.

She also noted the group would consider measures that could stimulate trading volumes, adding HKEX welcomes all firms - no matter if they are big or small - to list in the SAR.

“Do we want bigger companies or smaller companies, that's not up to us to choose, it depends on what companies make applications. We extend fair and equal treatment to all applicants. Even for small companies if they can satisfy all the standards, they can still be listed,” she said.

Her remarks came as some shareholders questioned whether the bourse would try and go after larger enterprises, such as electric-vehicle battery maker CATL, to list in Hong Kong.

As the exchange’s first female chair, Cha thanked shareholders and colleagues for their support over the past six years.

"It's been a privilege and an honour to have presided over this great organisation over the past six years," Cha said.

As Cha stepped down, the exchange’s new board of directors immediately appointed former Securities and Futures Commission chair, Carlson Tong, as the new HKEX chairman for a three-year term until 2025.

Tong's appointment is subject to the written approval of the Chief Executive, and a further announcement will be issued later.

Cha, meanwhile, will continue to serve as senior advisor to the exchange’s board until April next year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday reported a 13 percent annual decline in its net profit in the first quarter of this year, as lower turnover weighed on fees, while fewer listings eroded revenues.

Data from the city’s bourse showed the group’s profit stood at HK$2.97 billion for the first three months of the year, compared with the HK$3.4 billion seen in the same period a year ago when economic activities rebounded after Covid.

Revenue and other income also declined, dropping 6 percent year on year to HK$5.2 billion.

The declines came as average daily trading turnover dropped 22 percent year on year to HK$99.4 billion, while listing fees fell 25 percent year on year following the reduction in the number of new listings.

However, the lower income was partially offset by strong derivatives trading, record quarterly high turnover in the Northbound Stock Connect, as well as increased trades at its subsidiary, the London Metal Exchange.

“The HKEX demonstrated its strength and resilience in the first quarter of the year,” said the group’s newly appointed chief executive Bonnie Chan.

“Despite a fragile global backdrop, the group’s derivatives and commodities business performed strongly - the former achieving record quarterly volume,” she said, adding there was a notable increase in daily trading volume in March and April, indicating growing confidence.

“Looking ahead, despite the prevailing backdrop, we are optimistic about HKEX’s ability to capitalise on the long-term growth of China, the considerable opportunities to connect with the fast-growing capital hubs of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and the continuing exciting developments in technology in our industry and beyond,” Chan said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks rose for a second straight session on Tuesday, building on the prior day's positive momentum following a round of mostly good corporate earnings.

General Electric, Spotify Technology and Kimberly-Clark were among the companies winning strong gains after quarterly reports.

Briefing.com described the broad gains as "follow-through buying" after a rough period that generated talk that the market was "oversold" on a short-term basis.

The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,503.

The S&P 500 advanced 1.2 percent to 5,070, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.6 percent to 15,696.

After last week's losses, US stocks began the week on Monday on a solid note, advancing amid relief that there was no escalation in tensions between Iran and Israel over the weekend.

Among individual companies, General Motors shot up 4.4 percent as it lifted its full-year forecast following better than expected quarterly earnings. The automaker continued to point to solid pricing in the United States, which helped offset weakness in China.

GE Aerospace gained 8.3 percent after lifting its projections after reporting an uptick in orders and operating profit.

But JetBlue sank 18.9 percent as it projected lower revenues in the second quarter, noting that there is "significant elevated capacity" in the company's Latin region, pressuring results. (AFP)]]>
