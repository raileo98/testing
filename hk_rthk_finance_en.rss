The Shanghai Composite Index was also flat, ticking a third of a point lower to 3,128, while the Shenzhen Composite Index on the mainland's second exchange slid a quarter of a point to 1,773. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks moved in opposite directions on Wednesday, digesting another round of mixed earnings in a quarter that has seen solid but unspectacular corporate results.

"I think that companies did a nice job of outpacing their Q1 expectations. But I did notice that earnings estimates for the year for 2024 really haven't changed much," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, adding that companies aren't reporting "much earnings growth."

The Dow Jones finished up 0.4 percent at 39,056.

The S&P 500 was flat at 5,187, while the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent to 16,302.

Stocks finished little changed on Tuesday after three up days in which markets embraced Federal Reserve comments that further interest rate hikes were unlikely.

A handful of prominent earnings reports have commanded focus in a week with few major economic reports following last week's heavy calendar that included April jobs data and a Federal Reserve decision.

Among individual companies, Uber dropped 5.7 percent after reporting a US$654 million loss, while rival ride-hailing company Lyft jumped 7.1 percent after topping estimates, saying it sees solid demand growth.

Also higher was Reddit, which advanced 3.9 percent as it posted a 48 percent jump in revenues to US$243 million. The social media company said higher costs were driven by expenses for its initial public offering. (AFP)]]>

    FTX says customers will be repaid for losses

    <![CDATA[Customers of failed cryptocurrency platform FTX will be made whole on the assets they lost when the company collapsed in 2022, it announced on Wednesday.

The plan "contemplates the centralised distribution to customers and other creditors around the world of virtually all of the assets associated with FTX at the time of its collapse in November 2022," said a statement released by FTX Trading LTD.

Total distributions to customers will be between US$14.5-US$16.3 billion. FTX said the plan still must be approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court.

"We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100 percent of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors," said John Ray III, chief executive and chief restructurings officer of FTX.

FTX said it garnered the funds "by monetising an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets," mostly investments held by the company and affiliates and litigation claims.

Another factor was the resolution of claims against the firm, including some US$24 billion that had been sought by the Internal Revenue Service for the period prior to the Chapter 11 filing.

To resolve the IRS cases, FTX will instead pay US$200 million in cash and US$685 million to be paid out after other claims.

The plan also will pay out interest of up to nine percent, FTX said. What won't be included will be the appreciation in value that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have enjoyed since November 2022.

FTX collapsed suddenly following a deluge of customer withdrawals.

The company's chief architect, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison following a conviction of fraud and other financial crimes. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Auto-giant Toyota doubled its net profit in the fiscal year that ended in March, as strong vehicles sales and a favorable exchange rate lifted results for Japan’s top carmaker.

Toyota on Wednesday said its annual profit totaled 4.9 trillion yen, up from 2.45 trillion yen the year before, while its sales jumped 21 percent to 45 trillion yen. 

The results exceeded Toyota’s own projection for a 4.5 trillion yen profit, as its global sales surged to 9.4 million vehicles from 8.8 million vehicles in the previous fiscal year.

Sales of hybrids performed well, although Toyota stressed it was working hard to offer various kinds of electric vehicles, including battery EVs, plug-ins and fuel cell models.

The company expects to sell 9.5 million vehicles during this fiscal year, with sales projected to grow in the US and the rest of Asia.

Toyota said it will make key investments in areas such as research on technology in coming months to sustain long-term growth.

It expects its net profit for the fiscal year through to March 2025 to decline nearly 28 percent to 3.57 trillion yen, with spending also covering investments in workers at suppliers and dealers it called “human capital.”

“The latest results show that our efforts have borne fruit, but we need keep growing with the vision to become a mobility company,” Chief Executive Koji Sato told reporters. 

The auto industry is undergoing a sweeping transformation away from old-style gasoline engines, especially in markets like China, where EVs dominate and some analysts say automakers like Toyota may have fallen behind. (AP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks finished a choppy session essentially flat on Tuesday, a sideways performance that could persist until investors digest significant economic releases later in the month.

"The market might just be due for some pause, consolidation," said LBBW's Karl Haeling.

Analysts pointed to light trading volume in a comparatively quiet period of news after last week saw major earnings reports, economic releases and a Federal Reserve decision.

Upcoming potential catalysts include US consumer price data and Walmart results, both of which are scheduled for next week.

The Dow Jones edged up 0.1 percent to 38,884.

The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 5,187, while the Nasdaq dipped 0.1 percent to 16,332.

Among individual companies, Disney dropped 9.5 percent as it reported a small quarterly loss and pointed to a moderation in travel spending expected to weigh on results at its parks division.

Apple advanced 0.4 percent after unveiling new versions of its iPad tablets.

Spirit AeroSystems, a major contractor to Boeing and Airbus, fell 0.3 percent as it reported a US$616.7 million quarterly loss, reflecting a drag from lower output amid Boeing's quality control problems.

The company has also so far not reached a pricing agreement with Airbus, further weighing on financial performance. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive, John Lee, on Tuesday called on the financial sector to enhance cooperation with the mainland, after the nation’s securities regulator introduced measures to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) last month unveiled five measures to promote coordinated development between the capital markets of the mainland and Hong Kong.

These measures included relaxing eligibility criteria for exchange-traded fund products in the Stock Connect mechanism, as well as the inclusion of real estate investment trusts for the first time. The CSRC also said it would facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms, and loosen rules on stock trading links between exchanges in the SAR and the mainland.

Delivering his speech to over 200 business leaders prior to a closed-door discussion on enhancing collaboration between the financial markets in Hong Kong and the mainland, Lee said cross-border cooperation will bring in more business opportunities.

"Further integration and development with the mainland financial markets will help leverage Hong Kong's international advantages and enhance the competitiveness of the mainland financial market, attracting more capital and businesses. This will drive economic development and will allow people to share in the fruits of progress," he said.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting with business leaders, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the SAR government is still in negotiations with mainland authorities on the implementation of the CSRC's measures.

Chan noted that these measures would allow international investors to use Hong Kong as a gateway to access mainland equity markets.

"Hong Kong is the national springboard for mainland capital and investors seeking overseas opportunities, and thereby provides a very convenient and very familiar platform for overseas investors to go through Hong Kong to participate in the mainland equity market," he added.

The Securities and Futures Commission’s CEO Julia Leung, meanwhile, told reporters that the measures are expected to be implemented as early as the third quarter.]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks advanced on Monday, extending a rally on hopes for possible Federal Reserve interest rate cuts soon after weaker US jobs data.

US stocks were in positive territory the whole session as analysts pointed to Friday's jobs report showing weaker than expected employment growth.

A note from Charles Schwab characterised the report as "perfect" in terms of being in "not too hot and not too cold territory," while adding that "it's just one set of numbers and there's a risk that the market may overreact."

The Dow Jones finished at 38,852 up 0.5 percent.

The S&P 500 rose 1.0 percent to 5,180, while the Nasdaq climbed 1.2 percent to 16,349.

Major indices have risen the last three days.

Among individual companies, Paramount Global gained 3.1 percent following a New York Times report that it entered into talks with a bidding group led by Sony Pictures and Apollo after negotiations between Paramount and Skydance didn't produce a deal.

Tyson Foods slid 5.7 percent as it reported slightly lower revenues and projected flat sales in the upcoming quarter. Executives said inflation was pinching low-income consumers.

Spirit Airlines sank 10 percent after reporting a US$142.6 million quarterly loss. The carrier pointed to a "challenging" competitive environment due to "elevated capacity" in key markets. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Eddie Yue, on Monday urged banks to be prepared to operate during severe weather conditions. 

Yue told reporters that Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) is making progress towards ensuring local stock and derivatives markets can still function during adverse weather.

“Hong Kong Exchanges is now finalising the arrangement and we have asked the banks to make sure that they get prepared, so that whatever the final arrangement is they will be able to support it and we have asked them to make early preparations for example on if there should be any system change,” he said.

Yue's remarks follow the completion of a public consultation exercise by HKEX in January on ending stock market closures during severe weather events. 

Separately, Yue said the HKMA will host the third Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit from November 18 to 20, adding that around 50 to 60 people have confirmed their attendance.

The HKMA chief said he hopes the summit will attract prominent business figures to Hong Kong and will strengthen the city’s position as an international financial hub.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Monday said its Exchange Fund posted an investment gain of HK$54.3 billion in the first quarter of this year, despite the underwhelming performance of local stock markets. 

It was the second consecutive quarter of gains for the fund, whose primary role is to back the Hong Kong dollar. 

During a panel meeting in the Legislative Council, the HKMA revealed that the fund lost HK$2.3 billion in local equities in the first quarter and lost HK$4.8 billion on its foreign exchange assets. 

However, these were offset by gains of HK$25.1 billion from bond investments and HK$36.3 billion from other stocks.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said the future performance of the fund remains uncertain.

“The uncertainty about the US interest rate path, which will depend on the path of inflation in the US... we will still need to see the incoming economic data and see where the inflation path in the US will go, and see whether they will, as the market is expecting now, defer the rate cut decision and also the pace may be a little slower than expected before,” he explained. 

Yue also said tensions in the Middle East and the pace of economic recovery in mainland China contribute additional uncertainty to the performance of the Exchange Fund.]]>

    <![CDATA[Warren Buffett said he expects the US government to increase taxes to tackle widening fiscal deficits rather than reduce spending.

"I think higher taxes are likely," he said on Saturday at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha.

"They may decide that some day they don’t want the fiscal deficit to be this large because that has some important consequences. So they may not want to decrease spending and they may decide they’ll take a larger percentage of what we own, and we’ll pay it," he said.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated in its latest long-term budget projections federal deficits will rise to 8.5 percent of gross domestic product in fiscal 2054 from 5.5 percent in fiscal 2024. US budget deficits are expected to deteriorate if tax cuts introduced in 2017 are renewed next year. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street surged to a higher close on Friday as a softer-than-expected employment report bolstered the case for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve while also providing evidence of US economic resilience.

All three major US stock posted robust gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the pack, rising 2 percent with an assist from Apple shares following the iPhone maker's record share buyback announcement.

All three indexes notched their second straight Friday-to-Friday gains, capping a week in which markets were encouraged by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's more dovish-than-expected statements following Wednesday's rate decision.

The Labour Department's employment report showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected, while the unemployment rate ticked higher and wage growth unexpectedly cooled.

The report likely hit the sweet spot for the Fed, offering signs the labor market is softening, which Powell has deemed necessary to put inflation on a sustainable downward path. The report also provided assurances on US economic health.

The report prompted investors to raise bets the Fed would implement its first rate reduction in September.

"The investor narrative remains the Fed and interest rates and today’s weak jobs report puts rate cuts firmly on the Fed’s 2024 agenda," said Greg Bassuk, CEO at AXS Investments in New York.

Fed officials weighed in on the data. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated her willingness to hike rates if inflation progress reverses, and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the employment report boosted confidence the economy is not overheating.

Apple surged 6.0 percent, after the company unveiled a record US$110 billion share buyback program and beat quarterly expectations.

Travel platform Expedia cut its full-year revenue growth forecast, sending its shares sliding 15.3 percent.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.18 percent, to 38,676, the S&P 500 gained 1.26 percent, to 5,128 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.99 percent, to 16,156. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[US job growth slowed more than expected in April and the increase in annual wages fell below 4.0 percent for the first time in nearly three years, but it is probably too early to expect that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates before September as the labour market remains fairly tight.

The Labour Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed the unemployment rate rising to 3.9 percent from 3.8 percent in March amid increasing labour supply.

Nonetheless, the jobless rate remained below 4 percent for the 27th straight month. Data this week showed job openings declining in March.

Signs of labour market cooling raised optimism that the US central bank could after all engineer a "soft-landing" for the economy and doused chatter of stagflation, which had been fanned by news of a sharp moderation in economic growth and a surge in inflation in the first quarter.

Financial markets boosted the odds of a September rate cut and saw the Fed reducing borrowing costs twice this year instead of only once before the data.

"A cooler pace of hiring to a more sustainable pace should be interpreted as beneficial with respect to the inflation outlook going forward and remove any lingering concerns of a wage price spiral and put to bed loose and undisciplined talk from the corners of the trading community about stagflation," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 175,000 jobs last month, the fewest in six months, the Labour Department's Bureau of Labour Statistics said. Revisions showed 22,000 fewer jobs created in February and March than previously reported.  (Reuters)]]>

    HSBC not planning more asset sales: chairman

    <![CDATA[HSBC has no current plans to sell more assets, its chairman Mark Tucker said on Friday at the annual shareholder meeting of the bank, which has scaled back its presence in Western markets in recent years as part of a sweeping overhaul.

HSBC shareholders met in London days after the bank's CEO Noel Quinn announced his surprise retirement following a five-year tenure which saw HSBC sell retail banking operations in France and the US, and its entire Canadian unit, as it pivots towards Asia.

The chairman's comments hint at a likely shift in direction for whomever succeeds Quinn, as the bank turns its focus away from shrinking its global empire to trying to grow its business in its remaining markets.

Shareholders, as expected, backed a resolution to lift a cap on the size of bonuses HSBC can pay its top UK bankers, after Britain axed a policy limiting payouts that it had inherited from the European Union. Goldman Sachs is removing the cap and other banks are expected to follow suit.

Speaking to shareholders at the meeting, Tucker also said HSBC was in a strong position to continue paying robust dividends despite an uncertain global economic outlook and central bank policy moves.

The bank, which returned US$19 billion to shareholders in 2023 through dividends and share buybacks, has announced a further US$8.8 billion so far for 2024, and is targeting a dividend payout ratio of 50 percent this year, Tucker said.

HSBC has been able to splash out on such shareholder rewards in recent years as rising central bank interest rates have boosted its lending income, turbo-charging its profits.

Inflation remains key to the global interest rate outlook, Tucker said. HSBC economists forecast that global inflation will fall gradually to 5.8 percent in 2024 and 3.8 percent in 2025, having climbed as high as 6.3 percent in 2023.

The bank expects the European Central Bank and Bank of England to cut rates in June, both lowering by 150 basis points by the end of 2025, and expects the US Federal Reserve to cut in September, cutting by 100 basis points by the same time. (Reuters)]]>

    HK retail sales fall 7 percent in March

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's retail sales fell 7 percent in March from a year earlier, ending 15 months of growth.

According to figures released by the Census And Statistics Department on Friday, sales totalled HK$31.2 billion.

The decline followed a 1.9 percent increase in February, and 0.9 percent growth in January. 

Overall, retail sales for the first quarter of 2024 fell by 1.3 percent year-on-year.

In a statement, the government blamed the drop on the high base of comparison for visitor spending and the timing of the Easter holidays last year. 

It predicted that the retail sector will benefit from a continued tourism revival and rising household income. 

"Further revival of inbound tourism and rising household income should remain supportive to the retail sector. The government's efforts to promote a mega event economy and boost sentiment should also help. Yet, the changing consumption patterns of visitors and residents may continue to pose challenges," a spokesperson said.

The head of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, Annie Tse, said the sales drop was a result of more Hongkongers heading to the mainland in their free time.

"The northbound travel and consumption will continue since transportation is too convenient nowadays, and it is the trend. I would not say it's something that we want, but it's quite normal. We, as retailers, have to face the situation, and that will definitely be a continuing effect that will affect our industry," she said.]]>
