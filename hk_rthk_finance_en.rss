    US home sales slip on still high mortgage rates

    <![CDATA[Existing home sales in the United States crept lower in April as mortgage rates remained elevated, industry data showed on Wednesday.

Sales of previously owned homes dipped by 1.9 percent from March, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million, said the National Association of Realtors (NAR).

Analysts had expected a slight uptick last month.

"Home sales changed little overall, but the upper-end market is experiencing a sizeable gain due to more supply coming onto the market," NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.

Total housing inventory at the end of April was up nine percent from March, and was 16.3 percent higher than the same period a year ago.

Mortgage rates have surged in recent years as the Federal Reserve rapidly hiked the benchmark lending rate to tackle stubborn inflation.

For now, the central bank continues to hold rates steady as it seeks to stamp out price increases.

As of May 16, the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.02 percent, up from 6.39 percent a year prior, according to home loan finance firm Freddie Mac.

In mid-May 2021, the rate was around three percent.

Higher rates have weighed on transactions, as homeowners who locked in lower rates previously remained reluctant to enter the market.

From a year ago, home sales were also 1.9 percent lower in April, NAR data showed.

The median sales price in April rose 5.7 percent from a year ago to US$407,600 â€“ the highest since June 2023.

Looking ahead, however, "the pace of price increases should taper off since more housing inventory is becoming available," Yun said.

Mortgage demand is expected to remain tepid in the near term, given that long-term rates are still elevated, analysts from Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a recent note.

"We expect a decline in long-term rates over the next couple of months, but we also expect the labour market will start to look much weaker, slowing the growth in the pool of potential homebuyers," Pantheon added. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Nasdaq climbed to a fresh record on Tuesday following a choppy session after a smattering of mixed earnings and muted Federal Reserve commentary.

"There really isn't much economic news to speak of," said Cresset Capital's Jack Ablin, who pointed to Wednesday's earnings report from Nvidia as one of the highlights of the week.

Shares of Nvidia rose 0.6 percent.

Fed governor Christopher Waller welcomed last week's consumer price index report that showed moderating inflation, while adding that "several" months of additional data were needed before interest rates should be cut.

The tech-rich Nasdaq finished at 16,832, up 0.2 percent for the day and a record for the second straight session.

The Dow Jones also advanced 0.2 percent to 19,872, along with the S&P 500, which stood at 5,321.

Cresset's Ablin said the stock market is probably "overbought" at this point, adding that, "relative to bonds, the stock market is probably the most expensive it's been since the financial crisis."

All three major indices scored records last week following data showing a moderation in inflation.

Among individual companies, Lowe's dropped 1.9 percent after earnings topped analyst expectations. However, revenues for the home-improvement retailer fell about four percent to US$21.4 billion.

Trump Media & Technology Group slumped 8.7 percent after reporting a net loss of US$327.6 million in the quarter ending March 31.

Disney nudged up 0.1 percent following news the company's animation studio Pixar is laying off about 14 percent of its staff. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks dipped early on Tuesday, edging back from recent records following muted Federal Reserve commentary and mixed earnings.

Fed governor Christopher Waller welcomed last week's consumer price index report that showed moderating inflation, while adding that "several" months of additional data were needed before interest rates should be cut.

Among companies reporting results, Macy's climbed after its report, while both Lowe's and Palo Alto Networks pulled back.

About 15 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones was essentially flat at 39,824.

The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 5,305, while the Nasdaq declined 0.3 percent to 16,749, retreating from Monday's all-time high.

"Markets are hunting for catalysts and drifting as they wait," said a note from Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.

Among individual companies, Lam Research rose 1.1 percent after the semiconductor company announced a stock split and the authorisation of up to US$10 billion in share repurchases. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Gains by several large tech companies pushed the Nasdaq to a fresh record on Monday, on an overall mixed day for US equities as weakness at JPMorgan Chase dragged down the Dow.

Microsoft climbed 1.2 percent as it unveiled new PC offerings that feature generative artificial intelligence tools built directly into its Windows operating system.

Chip giant Nvidia also advanced ahead of its earnings release due later this week.

But JPMorgan slumped 4.5 percent, with analysts attributing the decline to CEO Jamie Dimon signalling he is closer to retiring from the US banking giant.

The tech-focused Nasdaq rose 0.7 percent to 16,794, topping last week's record.

The Dow Jones, meanwhile, slid 0.5 percent to 39,806, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent to 5,308.

Besides Nvidia earnings, this week's calendar includes Federal Reserve minutes from the May 1 meeting.

"It's a mixed session," said Peter Cardillo, of Spartan Capital. "I kind of think it's going to be this way until some new catalyst."

Results from some leading retailers, including Target and Lowe's, are also on this week's plate. Strong results from Walmart last week added to market momentum.

Among other equities, tech company Jabil shot up 5.2 percent after announcing that Michael Dastoor was promoted from chief financial officer to chief executive officer. The company also confirmed its profit forecast. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said while the macro-economy and investment sentiment have improved in recent months, not all industries in Hong Kong are recovering at the same pace. 

Writing on his weekly blog, Chan noted that local stocks traded near nine-month highs earlier this month and home prices rebounded in March after a 10-month fall, but he acknowledged that retailers and restaurant operators still face challenges.

"Indeed, the recovery is still uneven among different industries. The retail and catering sectors are still adapting to the challenges brought by changes in the consumption patterns of residents and tourists," he wrote.

"In response to market changes, we take the initiative and strive to create more favourable market conditions and atmospheres. We work with the business community to create new opportunities of growth for Hong Kong."

Chan added that the government will announce shortly mega events planned for the second half of the year.

He vowed to create tourism experiences with unique characteristics of the SAR to boost consumption.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Dow Jones finished above 40,000 points for the first time on Friday, as stocks were mixed on Wall Street at the end of the trading week.

The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to finish at 40,003.

The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 percent at 5,303, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent to 16,685.

But despite the slight decline in the Nasdaq, all three major indexes still finished the week higher than they were at the start of it.

"We made a breakout to new record high," said Karl Haeling from LBBW.

"The market is just choosing to consolidate, which is probably a healthy thing," he continued. "Because it's racing and getting too exuberant."

Among individual companies, petrochemical producer Valero Energy finished the day up 4.8 percent, while the mining company Freeport McMoRan was up 4.2 percent.

One of the day's big losers was Paramount Global, which saw its share price fall 4.9 percent. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Friday announced that a pilot electronic renminibi programme had been expanded to Hong Kong to include cross-border usage of the digital currency. 

It marks the first time since the launch of the e-CNY pilot scheme in 2019 that the nation's official digital currency was available for use outside of the mainland.

The programme, backed by Beijing, allows Hong Kong residents to open digital yuan wallets using a local mobile number via an app developed by China's central bank - the People's Bank of China.

The expansion of the programme permits users to make payments in retail shops and some online stores in Hong Kong, Macau and other Greater Bay Area cities as well as in other places covered by the pilot scheme.

Hongkongers who use the e-CNY wallets can pay up to 2,000 yuan for each transaction, and are limited to use up to 50,000 yuan worth of purchases per year. 

The apps are operated by four mainland banks, namely Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank as well as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, while users can top up their e-CNY wallets from 17 banks, including HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and Standard Chartered Bank. 

Speaking at a press briefing, the authority's deputy chief executive, Howard Lee, said the expansion of the pilot scheme would make it more convenient for Hongkongers to shop on the mainland.

"This is going to provide an additional means, a safe and secure means for people in Hong Kong to use this wallet across the border when they go there and they have a need to make a payment, or vice versa for mainland users coming to Hong Kong," he explained.

"There are already some other means that can be used for this purpose, but we thought that different people might have different preferences, so one more option is always better than one fewer option."

However, Hong Kong users currently cannot make peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, or electronic money transfers from oneself to another through the e-CNY wallets.]]>

    <![CDATA[Beijing on Friday announced some of its most sweeping measures yet to stabilise and revive the country's beleaguered property sector, allowing local governments to buy "some" apartments, relaxing mortgage rules and pledging further efforts to deliver unfinished homes.

Earlier, fresh data showed the fastest drop in new home prices in more than nine years, highlighted continued problems for an industry which at its peak accounted for a fifth of economic activity and remains a major drag on confidence and growth.

Vice Premier He Lifeng told an online meeting with other authorities that municipal governments could buy homes at "reasonable" prices.

The homes would be used to provide affordable housing, He said. 

The vice premier also said local governments could repurchase land sold to developers, and promised authorities would "fight hard" to complete stalled projects.

Separately, the People's Bank of China said it would further lower mortgage interest rates and down-payment requirements.

Shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers soared following the announcement. (Agencies)]]>

    HK court delays Country Garden hearing till June

    <![CDATA[The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition on Friday seeking the liquidation of Chinese property giant Country Garden. 

The decision provides some relief to the embattled developer amid Beijing's efforts to revive the crisis-hit property sector.

A Hong Kong firm filed the petition against Country Garden in February for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. The developer defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds last year and is in the process of an offshore debt restructuring.

Country Garden applied for the adjournment to prepare more evidence. The request was not opposed by the petitioner which filed the action against the company.

If Country Garden is able to present progress on the debt restructuring talks with its offshore creditors, it would help the developer push back against the liquidation petition.

A key group of creditors, the ad hoc group of bondholders, have signalled their "neutral stance" towards the liquidation petition, according to the petitioner's lawyer. 

In a letter to the court, the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing the ad hoc group, said they no longer intended to appear in the court.

The hearing into the petition comes against the backdrop of Beijing stepping up efforts to revive the property sector, which slipped into an unprecedented debt crisis in mid-2021.

Over the past few years, a growing list of developers has defaulted on debt repayment obligations and a handful of them, including China Evergrande, have been ordered to be liquidated. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Reddit has partnered with OpenAI to bring its content to popular chatbot ChatGPT, the companies said on Thursday, sending the social media platform's shares up 12 percent in extended trade.

The deal underscores Reddit's attempt to diversify beyond its advertising business, and follows its recent partnership with Alphabet to make its content available for training Google's AI models.

ChatGPT and other OpenAI products will use Reddit's application programming interface, the means by which Reddit distributes its content, following the new partnership.

OpenAI will also become a Reddit advertising partner, the company said.

Ahead of Reddit's March IPO, Reuters reported that Reddit struck its deal with Alphabet, worth about US$60 million per year.

Investors view selling its data to train AI models as a key source of revenue beyond Reddit's advertising business.

The social media company earlier this month reported strong revenue growth and improving profitability in the first earnings since its market debut, indicating that its Google deal and its push to grow its ads business were paying off.

Reddit's shares rose 10.5 percent to US$62.31 after the bell. As of Wednesday's close, the stock is up nearly 12 percent since its market debut in March. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks finished modestly lower on Thursday, retreating from a record run that included the Dow's first ever rise above 40,000 points.

The Dow lingered above that level for hours before ending slightly lower.

"We had a big move yesterday in response to data that were friendly for the Fed," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.

"Today there was this absence of any major catalyst," he said. "With stocks at all-time highs, I think taking a breather is healthy."

The Dow Jones finished down 0.1 percent at 39,869.

The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent to 5,297, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.3 percent to 16,698.

All three indices finished at records on Wednesday following data showing a cooling in US inflation that raised hopes of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

Among individual companies, Walmart shot up 7.0 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits as the retail giant pointed to gains from wealthier consumers.

But Deere & Company dropped 4.7 percent as it projected broad-based 2024 sales declines in light of a tough operating environment in the farming economy. (AFP)]]>
