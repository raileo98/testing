    <![CDATA[L'Oreal's chief executive gave a cautious outlook about China, the world's No. 2 beauty market, on Thursday even after the cosmetics maker reported first-quarter sales growth of more than 6 percent for the country.

The first-quarter performance in China was well above sector growth of 1 percent, Nicolas Hieronimus told analysts in a call after the French cosmetics giant that owns the Maybelline and Lancome brands released better-than-expected first-quarter sales.

Even so, he is not banking on any major improvement in consumer confidence.

"We plan with, I would say, a China that is not doing fantastic, and we make the most of the opportunities in Europe, in emerging (markets) and gaining share in North America," he said.

"And if China accelerates, it will be a positive news on our own expectations."

Demand for mass market products in China has accelerated during the quarter to a greater extent than in the United States, he said.

The make-up market has slowed the most in North America, although fragrance is doing "great", he said in the call. (Reuters)]]>

    US markets end down, as rate cut hopes dim

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks finished mostly lower on Thursday after another volatile session as rising US Treasury bond yields reflected dimming hopes for an imminent pivot in the Fed's monetary policy.

"Price action feeds on itself," Karl Haeling of LBBW said of the lacklustre session. "People see the market going down and they say, 'Get me out.'"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.1 percent gain at 37,775.

But the S&P 500 dipped 0.2 percent to 5,011, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.5 percent to 15,601.

The market's current posture towards pullbacks contrasts with the approach earlier in the year when investors eagerly stepped in to buy equities during periods of weakness.

Analysts attribute the shift in large part to the growing expectation that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates fewer times, if at all, in 2024, than was initially expected.

Among individual companies, Netflix fell 0.4 percent ahead of its release of quarterly results. The company reported better-than-expected profits of $2.3 billion after the market closed.

The streaming giant is the first major tech company to report this quarter. Other giants, such as Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta, are scheduled to report next week.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company fell 4.9 percent, citing "weakening macroeconomic conditions" and softening demand. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's unemployment rate rose to 3 percent in three-month period ending in March, according to official figures released on Thursday. 

That's a 0.1 percentage point increase compared with the December-to-February period. 

Another 9,400 people became jobless during the first quarter of 2024, with officials noting that there were 111,700 unemployed persons in the three-month period ending in March. 

Meanwhile, the underemployment rate edged up slightly to 1.1 percent. 

In a statement, Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rate was generally low despite the uptick. 

"The unemployment rates of most sectors increased in January - March 2024 compared with the preceding three-month period, but stayed low in general," he said. 
 
"As the economy continues to grow, the labour market will likely remain tight in the near term."]]>

    <![CDATA[The city’s bourse on Thursday announced it is developing a tech platform that would allow it to offer near 24-hour derivatives trading while improving efficiency and introducing new products to address rapidly changing customer needs.

In a statement, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), the city’s stock operator, also said that the in-house platform - Orion Derivatives Platform (ODP) - would be launched in 2028, which would help differentiate the group’s derivatives offerings while boosting its global competitiveness in the derivatives market.

“Building future-ready technology platforms and operations is a key strategic priority for HKEX, as we help our markets and participants deliver long-term, sustainable growth and development,” said the group’s chief executive Bonnie Chan.

“We are therefore pleased to announce plans to develop the ODP, representing our significant investment into the future of our markets,” Chan added.

Noting that derivatives were one of the faster growing segments of HKEX’s business, with record-breaking volumes in both 2023 and 2022, Chan said such a platform would provide unique advantages - with enhanced trading and clearing capabilities and capital efficient risk management tools. 

The bourse also said it would actively engage with market participants during the development process.]]>

    <![CDATA[Morgan Stanley and HSBC are cutting dozens of investment banking jobs in the Asia Pacific region this week, sources said, as they ramp up cost-cutting, with weaker dealmaking and sluggish markets weighing on business prospects.

Morgan Stanley is cutting at least 50 investment banking jobs in the region starting this week, three sources with knowledge of the matter said, affecting around 13 percent of the Wall Street bank's Asia investment banking workforce of 400.

Layoffs at the investment banking unit of HSBC, which makes the bulk of its profits in Asia, started on Tuesday and are expected to see the departure of around 30 dealmakers in the region this week, three separate sources said.

All of the sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.

Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the job cuts.

An HSBC spokesperson said the banks is continuing to invest in and grow its business, allocating people and resources to the immediate opportunities, but declined to comment on the job cuts.

In January, Bank of America laid off around 20 bankers in the region, following a flurry of investment bank downsizing by UBS, Citigroup and other boutique firms.

Outside Asia, US banking giants overall continued to shed employees in the first quarter, with Citigroup seeing the biggest drop. Banks are under pressure to control costs due to the uncertain economic outlook. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[US stocks fell in choppy trading on Wednesday as investors assessed the Federal Reserve's interest rate stance and a batch of soft earnings early in the financial reporting season.

Travelers tumbled 7.41 percent and was among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and largest on the Dow Industrials after the insurance giant missed Wall Street expectations for first-quarter profit.

Also weighing on the benchmark S&P index after quarterly results were Prologis, with the warehouse-focused real estate investment trust dropping 7.19 percent, and Abbott Laboratories, which fell 3.03 percent after topping quarterly estimates but disappointing on its annual forecast.

After a rally in the last two months of 2023 that extended into the first quarter, equities have struggled with the S&P 500 registering its fourth straight session of declines. The index is on pace for its third straight weekly loss as investors have dialed back expectations for the timing and size of the Fed's rate cuts.

On Tuesday, US central bank officials including Fed Chair Jerome Powell backed away from providing guidance on when rates may be cut, saying instead that monetary policy needs to be restrictive for longer.

"The markets are dealing with a couple things - inflation is hotter than most expect, rate cut expectations are coming down and we've had a ramp higher in geopolitical tensions, particularly out of the Middle East," said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan.

"It's just an excuse for traders to kind of move to the sidelines and markets to kind of take a breath after a really, really strong five months of gains."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.12 percent, to 37,753, the S&P 500 lost 0.58 percent, to 5,022 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.15 percent, to 15,683.

Fed Board Governor Michelle Bowman and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are scheduled to speak later in the day.

Among gainers, United Airlines surged 17.45 percent after it forecast stronger-than-expected current-quarter numbers. JB Hunt Transport Services slumped 8.12 percent as the worst performer on the S&P 500 after the trucking firm missed Wall Street estimates for first-quarter results. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Facebook owner Meta and other online platforms must not force users to pay for the right to data protection enshrined in EU law when offering ad-free subscriptions, the European data regulator said Wednesday.

"Online platforms should give users a real choice when employing 'consent or pay' models," the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) chair Anu Talus said in a statement.

"The models we have today usually require individuals to either give away all their data or to pay," he said. "As a result, most users consent to the processing in order to use a service, and they do not understand the full implications of their choices."

Meta in November launched a "pay or consent" system allowing users to withhold use of their data for ad targeting in exchange for a monthly fee – a model that has faced several challenges from privacy and consumer advocates.

Meta has long profited from selling user data to advertisers but this business model has led to multiple battles with EU regulators over data privacy.

The latest announcement came after the data protection authorities of The Netherlands, Norway and the German state of Hamburg went to the EDPB for an opinion regarding the pay-or-consent model used by Meta.

All digital platforms must comply with the European Union's mammoth general data protection regulation (GDPR), which has been at the root of EU court cases against Meta.

The EDPB in its opinion argued that Meta's model was at odds with the GDPR's requirement that consent for data use must be freely given.

"In most cases, it will not be possible for large online platforms to comply with the requirements for valid consent if they confront users only with a binary choice between consenting to processing of personal data for behavioural advertising purposes and paying a fee," the opinion read.

The EDPB also warned the type of subscription service put forward by Meta "should not be the default way forward" for platforms.

It suggested that platforms should consider an alternative that would give users the right to reject being tracked for advertising purposes without the need to pay. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks ended lower in choppy trading on Tuesday as Treasury yields climbed, with investors weighing the likely path of interest rates in a resilient US economy with persistent inflation.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday recent inflation data has not given policymakers enough confidence to ease credit soon, noting that the US central bank may need to keep rates higher for longer than previously thought.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average got a boost from UnitedHealth Group's better-than-expected quarterly results. Real estate and utilities were the biggest drags on the S&P 500, while technology gave the largest boost.

"People are trying to balance this two-sided narrative: US economic growth, which looks really good, and at the same time the inflation picture and interest rates, which will eventually be problematic for the equity market," said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in California.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17 percent, to 37,799, the S&P 500 lost 0.21 percent, to 5,051 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.12 percent, to 15,865.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are nearly 4 percent off from record high levels reached last month.

Shares of Morgan Stanley rose 2.5 percent after its first-quarter profit beat estimates on resurging income from investment banking.

Bank of America dropped 3.5 percent after the lender posted lower first-quarter profits as its loan loss provisions grew.

Johnson & Johnson slipped 2.1 percent as the drugmaker's revenue missed analysts' estimates after sales from its blockbuster psoriasis drug, Stelara, fell short of expectations.

Tesla slipped 2.7 percent a day after falling over 5 percent on news that the EV marker plans to lay off more than 10 percent of its global workforce. (Reuters)]]>

    IMF expects steady growth, lower inflation

    <![CDATA[The global economy is set for another year of slow but steady growth, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday, with US strength pushing world output through headwinds from lingering high inflation, weak demand in China and Europe, and spillovers from two regional wars.

The IMF forecast global real GDP growth of 3.2 percent for 2024 and 2025 – the same rate as in 2023. The 2024 forecast was revised upward by 0.1 percentage point from the previous World Economic Outlook's estimate in January, largely due to a significant upward revision in the US outlook.

"The global economy continues to display remarkable resilience with growth holding steady and inflation declining, but many challenges still lie ahead," Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, told reporters.

A potential escalation of the Middle East conflict after Iran's rocket and drone attack on Israel could have a "strong effect" on limiting growth, he said, adding that it would raise oil prices and inflation, triggering tighter monetary policy from central banks.

The US Treasury is preparing to hit Iran with new sanctions in coming days that could limit its ability to export oil, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Tuesday.

The report described an "adverse scenario" in which a Middle East escalation would lead to a 15 percent increase in oil prices and higher shipping costs would hike global inflation by about 0.7 percentage points.

The IMF forecast that global median headline inflation will fall to 2.8 percent by the end of 2024 from 4 percent last year, and to 2.4 percent in 2025.

The IMF left unchanged its forecast for China's 2024 growth to fall to 4.6 percent from 5.2 percent in 2023. But it warned that the lack of a comprehensive restructuring package for the country's property sector could prolong a downturn in domestic demand.

Gourinchas said, however, that China's stronger-than-expected first-quarter growth may prompt an upward revision to the outlook. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[China's economy grew 5.3 percent in the first quarter year-on-year, official data showed on Tuesday, comfortably beating analysts' expectations, a welcome sign for policymakers as they try to shore up demand and confidence.

Analysts polled by Reuters news agency had expected first-quarter gross domestic product to expand 4.6 percent from a year earlier, compared to 5.2 percent in the previous three months.

Sheng Laiyun, National Bureau of Statistics deputy commissioner, said the nation had made solid progress over the period.

"Generally, in the first quarter, the national economy made a good start, accumulating positive factors and laying a solid foundation for achieving the annual goal," Sheng said.

"However, we should say that there are rising complexities and uncertainties in the external environment," he said, adding that authorities will boost economic vitality, prevent and diffuse risks, as well as enhance the momentum for economic recovery and growth.

Mainland officials are aiming for economic growth of around five percent for 2024, a target that many analysts believe is ambitious and may require more stimulus.

Meanwhile, retail sales and industrial production in China slowed in March.

Retail sales growth slowed to 3.1 percent year-on-year in March, down from a 5.5 percent increase in the first two months of 2024, while industrial production rose 4.5 percent, down from a 7 percent increase in the first two months, official data showed. (Reuters/AFP)

    <![CDATA[Wall Street stocks finished decisively lower on Monday despite solid US economic data, in a decline blamed on worries over conflict in the Middle East.

Equities had opened positively following solid retail sales data, amid early hopes that the conflict between Israel and Iran might ebb after a weekend siege by Iran was mostly repelled by air defences.

But Israeli officials kept up the confrontational rhetoric, with Israel's army chief Herzi Halevi vowing a response.

The Dow Jones finished at 37,735, down 0.7 percent after notching a 650-point fall from its peak earlier in the session.

The S&P 500 dropped 1.2 percent to 5,061, while the Nasdaq fell 1.8 percent to 15,885.

Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare pointed to the geopolitical situation as a factor in Monday's drop, but also noted that the retreat follows a period of market strength.

"If you set aside what's happening geopolitically there have been calls for a while now that the market's due for a pullback," O'Hare said.

"So there's an overdue period of consolidation kicking in here, which has been helped along by the geopolitical uncertainty, rising interest rates, and again, the technical deterioration in the market."

Among individual companies, Goldman Sachs rose 2.9 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits on a strong performance across most businesses.

Tesla slumped 5.6 percent after Elon Musk's electric vehicle company announced it was cutting more than 10 percent of its global headcount amid rising competition for EVs.

Salesforce plunged 7.3 percent following reports it is in talks to buy technology company Informatica. Informatica lost 6.4 percent.

Trump Media & Technology Group, the social media company associated with the ex-president and current US Republican White House nominee, dove 18.4 percent after announcing plans to issue more shares. (AFP)]]>

    Firms win approval to launch spot bitcoin, ether ETFs

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong on Monday gave initial approval to its first spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), paving the way for the city to become Asia’s first to treat cryptocurrencies as a mainstream investment tool, according to fund managers.

At least three offshore Chinese asset managers will launch the virtual asset spot ETFs soon.

The local units of Harvest Fund Management and Bosera Asset Management said they had received conditional approvals from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the city’s securities watchdog, to launch the ETFs.

Meanwhile, the local unit of China Asset Management said it had received regulatory approval for the provision of virtual asset management services, and that it's actively deploying the spot bitcoin and ether ETFs.

Emil Chan, co-chair of the Hong Kong Digital Finance Association, told RTHK that the move will boost the SAR's status as a financial centre.

“There was an exodus earlier that many funds and talent moved from Hong Kong to Singapore because they were unclear about the regulatory status... this time, Hong Kong has moved fast to catch up in a short period of time,” he said.

The fintech specialist also noted that traditional investors may be attracted to this market as the crypto ETFs allow them to utilise the traditional trading mechanism to access such assets without needing to worry about managing cryptocurrency keys and storage.

The US launched its first ETFs to track spot bitcoin in January, drawing roughly US$12 billion in net flows.

The city’s bourse may take about two weeks to prepare the funds to be offered, meaning the first set of spot ETFs could be available as early as this month.

“The [approval] of the crypto ETFs sent a strong signal to the traditional securities trading markets and players that they have to move forward to look into crypto trading with a different perspective," Chan said.

“In the past they considered crypto as unreal, but now it’s being sorted, and if its progress is solid, then it will boost transition and development of the virtual asset industry.” (Additional reporting by Reuters)]]>
