    Nato chief says 'not too late' for Ukraine to win war

    <![CDATA[Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday it was "not too late" for Ukraine to win the war, agreeing with President Volodymyr Zelensky that Kyiv needs more weapons, while Russian forces advance.

Stoltenberg was in Ukraine when Russia claimed the capture of two eastern villages in 24 hours, rushing an advance in the Donetsk region before crucial US weapons reach Kyiv's exhausted forces on the front.

"Ukraine has been outgunned for months, forced to ration its ammunition... But it's not too late for Ukraine to prevail," the Nato secretary general said at a press conference with Zelensky.

He said months-long delays in US military aid to Ukraine had "serious consequences on the battlefield."

Stoltenberg said that "more support is on the way."

"Our allies are looking into what more they can do and I expect new announcements soon. So we are working hard to meet Ukraine's urgent needs," he promised.

Ukraine has been dependent on Western military aid to counter Russia's larger and more powerful army.

Zelensky urged faster deliveries to bolster the front line.

"The Russian army is now trying to take advantage of the situation when we are expecting supplies from our partner," the Ukrainian leader said.

"That is why promptness in supply literally means stabilisation of the front line," he said.

"Together we must disrupt the Russian offensive," he said.

Speaking of the long-awaited aid, Zelensky said "some things have started to arrive" but declined to "go into details."

US President Joe Biden gave final approval for the aid – blocked in Congress for months – last week, saying shipments will start "right away."

On Sunday, Ukraine said the situation was deteriorating for its troops in the eastern Donetsk region. (AFP)]]>

    Dozens killed as dam bursts in flood-hit Kenya

    <![CDATA[At least 46 people including children died when a makeshift dam burst its banks in Kenya's Rift Valley in the early hours of Monday, a local official said, as torrential rains and floods battered the country.

Scores of people have been killed over the March-May wet season in Kenya as heavier than usual rainfall pounds East Africa, compounded by the El Nino weather pattern.

Residents said the accident occurred in the dead of night when the dam burst near the town of Mai Mahiu in Nakuru county, sending torrents of water and mud gushing down a hill and engulfing everything in its path.

The deluge cut off a road, uprooted trees, washed away homes and sent vehicles flying, devastating the village of Kamuchiri.

"We heard what sounded like an earthquake and roars like a moving train," said Margaret Wangechi, a 52-year-old teacher.

Joyce Ncece, chief officer for disaster management in Nakuru County, said on Monday evening that there were 46 bodies at the mortuary, but warned that the number could increase.

The dead included 20 women and 17 children, she said.

Nakuru governor Susan Kihika said 110 people were being treated in hospital.

Rescuers dug through the debris, using hoes and in some cases just their bare hands in a desperate search for survivors.

"We collected some of the bodies held by trees and we don't know how many are under the mud," Stephen Njihia Njoroge, a local resident involved in the emergency efforts, said.

The disaster occurred at Old Kijabe dam, a hillside barrier formed naturally over decades after railway construction work by Kenya's former British colonial rulers.

The Red Cross has set up a desk at a local school to help families find lost loved ones.

Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki said the government had called for inspections of all dams and reservoirs within 24 hours in case there is a need for evacuations.

He also said on X that the authorities would arrest people engaging in "risky behaviour," including motorists attempting dangerous crossings and anyone seeking to transport "passengers across flooded rivers or storm water by unsafe canoes or boats."

His comments came after a crowded boat capsized at the weekend in flooded Tana River county in eastern Kenya.

Kindiki said two bodies had been found and 23 people rescued, and that search and rescue efforts were ongoing.

The Kenyan government spokesman said on Monday that 103 people had lost their lives in floods since March, in a statement that did not mention the dam disaster.

More than 28,000 households have been displaced and over 185,000 people affected, the statement said.

The education ministry announced on Monday it would postpone the reopening of schools following mid-term holidays to May 6 because of the rains.

The weather has also wreaked havoc in neighbouring Tanzania, where at least 155 people have been killed in flooding and landslides. (AFP)]]>

    Blinken 'hopeful' Hamas will accept Gaza deal

    <![CDATA[US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday he was hopeful Hamas would accept an "extraordinarily generous" offer to halt Israel's Gaza offensive in return for the release of hostages.

"Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel," Blinken said in Riyadh at the World Economic Forum.

"In this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas," he said.

"They have to decide – and they have to decide quickly," Blinken said. "I'm hopeful that they will make the right decision."

"We can have a fundamental change in the dynamic" in more than half-a-year of bloodshed, Blinken said.

A delegation from Hamas was due on Monday in Egypt, which with Qatar has been seeking to broker a deal that would halt the Israeli offensive and see hostages freed.

Blinken also discussed the ceasefire proposal on Monday in Riyadh with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan of Turkey, where Hamas maintains an office and the militants' chief Ismail Haniyeh is a frequent visitor.

Blinken in the talks with Fidan "urged that all efforts be brought to bear to convince Hamas to accept the immediate ceasefire proposal that is on the table," a State Department statement said.

Turkey recognises Israel but President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been a strident critic of its Gaza offensive.

Erdogan has voiced an eagerness for a greater role in mediating the Gaza conflict after Qatar in recent weeks indicated it would take a step back. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday said that after a period of reflection about his future he had decided to continue as the country's leader.

Sanchez said he had informed King Felipe VI of his decision.

His decision to continue draws a line under a week in which Spanish politics was thrown into further turmoil by the prospect of facing another parliamentary vote to choose a new prime minister or even a fourth general election in five years.

Sanchez, 52, surprised both foes and allies alike when he said last Wednesday he was taking several days away from public duty to consider quitting, provoking large demonstrations from his followers in the country over the weekend.

He made his announcement on the same day a court said it would investigate his wife, Begona Gomez, for influence peddling and business corruption, allegations he said were false and orchestrated by his conservative opponents. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday arrived in Riyadh at the start of a new trip to the Middle East aimed at pushing for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and increasing humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.

The top US diplomat will also visit Jordan and Israel on his seventh visit to the region since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel which triggered the Israeli assault on Gaza.

In Saudi Arabia, Blinken was expected hold new talks with the Saudi leadership on potential normalisation of relations with Israel, a US State Department official said.

Saudi Arabia was considering the step -- which would carry massive significance as the kingdom is guardian of Islam's two holiest sites -- before October 7.

The United States has sought to keep up momentum, dangling the prospect of normalisation to encourage moderation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a long-time opponent of Palestinian statehood.

Blinken will also meet in Riyadh with a number of Gulf Arab and European foreign ministers who are visiting for a World Economic Forum meeting and Gulf Cooperation Council talks.

Blinken will discuss "day-after" plans for reconstruction of post-war Gaza, according to the US State Department.

Plans could include funding to rebuild Gaza -- the vast majority of whose people have been displaced -- or support for installing new governance structures.

Blinken arrived hours after US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu spoke by phone about ongoing talks to halt Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for the release of hostages.

Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce between Israel and Hamas for months, as public pressure mounts for a deal. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[At least four people died, including a four-month-old baby, and scores were injured in the state of Oklahoma after dozens of twisters swept the US Southern Plains, while weather alerts on Sunday put more than 7 million Americans under tornado warnings.

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt on Sunday declared a disaster emergency for the state, freeing up more money for first responders and recovery operations.

"Definitely the most damage since I've been governor," Stitt said in Sulphur, one of the hardest-hit communities, as he provided an update on fatalities and damage. 

Stitt began his first term as governor in 2019.

In a call with the Oklahoma governor, President Joe Biden offered the full support of the federal government to help with the recovery efforts, the White House said in a statement.

Storm warnings for high winds, heavy rain and hail also were issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) on Sunday for more than 47 million people stretching from East Texas north through Illinois and Wisconsin.

The NWS reported 38 possible twisters hit the area and that the worst of the storms rolled through Central Oklahoma on Saturday into early Sunday morning, spreading into northwest Texas, western Missouri and Kansas.

The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said area hospitals reported 100 injuries. 

Twisters destroyed or damaged dozens of structures, including the hospital in the town of Marietta, although no injuries were reported there.

More than 20,000 customers in the state remained without power as of Sunday evening, according to officials, as emergency personnel worked to clear roads and repair power lines. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he will host a meeting of state and territory leaders on Wednesday to discuss a coordinated response towards violence against women.

Thousands protested in cities around the country at the weekend to draw attention to the deaths of 27 women so far this year allegedly caused by acts of gender-based violence in a population of 27 million.

Albanese on Monday described domestic violence as a “national crisis”, and said the rallies were a call to action for all levels of Australian government to do more to prevent gender-based violence.

"Quite clearly, we need to do more. It’s not enough to just have empathy,” Albanese told Nine Network television.

"The fact that... a woman dies every four days on average at the hand of a partner is just a national crisis,” he added.

There were 17 rallies held across Australia over the weekend, with an estimated 15,000 people demonstrating in the city of Melbourne.

Albanese, his Women’s Minister Katy Gallagher and Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth received a hostile response when they attended a rally in the capital Canberra on Sunday.

Protesters yelled at the government leaders, “we want action” and “do your job.”

Albanese said there needed to be more focus on perpetrators and prevention of violence. “We need to change the culture, we need to change attitudes, we need to change the legal system,” he told the rally. (AP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Ukraine's army leader admitted on Sunday that Kyiv's position on the battlefield has worsened after Russian forces captured another village in the east, pressing their advantage in manpower and ammunition.

Russia's troops are advancing in the eastern Donetsk region as Kyiv awaits the arrival of much-needed US weapons that it hopes will stabilise the fragile front lines.

"The situation at the front has worsened," Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky said in a Facebook post on Sunday.

Ukrainian troops had "retreated" westwards to new defensive lines in a section of the front that runs past the city of Donetsk, controlled by pro-Russian forces since 2014.

Russia has "a significant advantage in forces and means" and had been able to notch up advances amid "heavy fighting," Syrsky said.

"In some sectors the enemy had tactical success, and in some areas our troops managed to improve the tactical position," he added.

Russia's defence ministry earlier on Sunday claimed its troops had captured the village of Novobakhmutivka in the Donetsk region – around 10 kilometres north of Avdiivka, which they seized in February.

The stark assessment of the picture facing Ukrainian troops comes at the end of week of ups and downs for Kyiv.

The United States finally approved a US$61 billion package of financial aid after months of political wrangling, unlocking much-needed arms for Ukraine's stretched troops.

But on the battlefield Russia chalked up more successes.

Its troops managed to make rapid advances in a narrow column to the northwest of Avdiivka. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[US President Joe Biden spoke with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Sunday and "reviewed ongoing talks" to free hostages taken by Hamas during their October 7 attack on Israel, the White House said.

The two allies "reviewed ongoing talks to secure the release of hostages together with an immediate ceasefire in Gaza," the White House statement said, as diplomatic efforts intensified to reach a long-sought truce in the war-battered region.

The Israeli government has come under intense pressure from its global allies to reach a ceasefire, as well as from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages seized by the Palestinian militant group during the attack that triggered the war.

Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce for months.

Biden and Netanyahu "also discussed increases in the delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza including through preparations to open new northern crossings starting this week," the statement said.

"The President stressed the need for this progress to be sustained and enhanced in full coordination with humanitarian organisations," it said.

With humanitarian agencies sounding ever more dire warnings of a crisis in Gaza, Israel has come under increasing pressure – globally and from the United States specifically – to allow more aid into the territory.

Biden also "reiterated his clear position" on any Israeli assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the statement said.

Netanyahu has vowed to send troops into Rafah, where more than 1.5 million civilians have taken refuge.

The Biden administration, while backing Israel, has repeatedly voiced alarm over the heavy toll on civilians in the Gaza offensive and has pressed Israel to hold off on any Rafah assault. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[An exceptional number of powerful tornadoes have ravaged parts of Oklahoma and nearby Great Plains states in the US, with one small town reportedly hit by two separate tornadoes within hours, authorities said on Sunday.

After 78 tornadoes were reported on Friday, mostly in Nebraska and Iowa, a separate weather system on Saturday brought 35 tornado reports from northern Texas to Missouri, the National Weather Service said.

At least two people, including a four-month-old child, died in the Oklahoma town of Holdenville, according to multiple reports in state and local media, though crews on Sunday were still sifting through the mounds of rubble.

The storms dumped up to 18 centimetres of rain in some places within hours, and meteorologists warned of a continuing danger of extreme weather on Sunday, including flash flooding, hail and more tornadoes.

Videos and images posted on social media showed scores of building flattened in the small town of Sulphur, in south-central Oklahoma, with vehicles smashed or overturned and trees stripped of branches and leaves.

Postal trucks in Sulphur rested precariously atop the nearly unrecognisable wreckage of buildings, one video showed. Rescue crews went house to house and vehicle to vehicle in search of victims or survivors.

"DO NOT COME TO SULPHUR UNLESS YOU ARE A FIRST RESPONDER!!!" the Murray County sheriff's office said in a Facebook post.

A tornado that struck Ardmore, Oklahoma tossed debris up to 6,100 metres high, the Washington Post reported. Then two other tornadoes came close to the town in the ensuing two hours.

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt declared a 30-day state of emergency to expedite aid to 12 of the hardest-hit counties.

More than 50,000 homes in Texas and more than 30,000 in Oklahoma were without power as of late Sunday morning, the poweroutage.us website reported.

The region is known for the frequency and power of the tornadoes that rumble through every spring. But having separate major outbreaks in succeeding days is exceedingly rare, meteorologists said. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Diplomatic efforts intensified on Sunday to reach a long sought-after truce and hostage-release deal in Gaza, as Hamas said it would travel to mediator Egypt to deliver its response to Israel's latest proposal.

The Israeli government has come under intense pressure to reach a ceasefire from its global allies, as well as from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages seized by Hamas during their October 7 attack that triggered the war.

A Hamas delegation will arrive in Egypt on Monday to deliver the group's response to Israel's new hostage and truce counterproposal, a senior official of the militant group said.

Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.

Hamas has previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire – a condition that Israel has rejected.

However the Axios news website, citing two Israeli officials, reported that Israel's latest proposal includes a willingness to discuss the "restoration of sustainable calm" in Gaza after hostages are released.

It is the first time in the nearly seven-month war that Israeli leaders have suggested they are open to discussing an end to the war, Axios said.

A Hamas source close to the negotiations said that the group "is open to discussing the new proposal positively."

The source added that the group is "keen to reach an agreement that guarantees a permanent ceasefire, the free return of displaced people, an acceptable deal for (prisoner) exchange and ensuring an end to the siege" in Gaza.

The new hopes of a potential truce came as world leaders and humanitarian groups warned that a looming Israeli invasion of the southernmost city of Rafah would lead to massive civilian causalities.

Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas appealed to the US to stop Israel from invading Rafah, which he said would be "the biggest disaster in the history of the Palestinian people." (AFP)]]>

    Nearly 200 detained in US campus protests

    <![CDATA[Police detained nearly 200 people at three US universities on Saturday as they cleared pro-Palestinian encampments, in the latest campus clashes triggered by protests over Israel's war against Hamas.

On the East Coast, police in Boston detained about 100 people while clearing a protest camp at Northeastern University, with social media posts showing security forces in riot gear and officers loading tents onto the back of a truck.

The action was taken after some protesters resorted to "virulent anti-Semitic slurs, including 'Kill the Jews,'" Northeastern University said in a statement on social media platform X.

On the opposite side of the country, Arizona State University police arrested 69 people for trespassing after the group set up an "unauthorised encampment" on campus.

Arizona State officials said a protest group – "most of whom were not ASU students, faculty or staff" – had set up a camp on Friday and then ignored repeated orders to disperse.

And in the US heartland, police at Indiana University arrested 23 people as they cleared a campus protest camp, the Indiana Daily Student newspaper reported.

Police with shields, batons and other riot gear broke through a line of protesters who had linked arms, tackling those who did not move, the paper said.

The campus activists are calling for a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas, as well as for colleges to sever ties with the country and with companies they say profit from the conflict.

The protests have posed a major challenge to university administrators who are trying to balance commitments to free expression with complaints that the rallies have veered into anti-Semitism and hate speech.

Police have carried out large-scale arrests at universities in recent days, at times using chemical irritants and tasers to disperse demonstrators.

In a statement on X, Northeastern said the area on campus where the protests were held was now "fully secured" and "all campus operations have returned to normal."

The school said it made the move after "what began as a student demonstration two days ago was infiltrated by professional organisers with no affiliation to Northeastern."

It added that detained individuals who produced a valid school ID have been released and will face disciplinary proceedings, not legal action.

"Those who refused to disclose their affiliation were arrested," the school said.

Dozens of students remained encamped on Saturday at the University of Pennsylvania, despite the college president ordering disbandment after what he said were "credible reports of harassing and intimidating conduct."

Meanwhile, Columbia University in New York, where the protests originated, was relatively calm. Officials there announced on Friday that they would not be calling police back to campus after more than 100 people were arrested last week.

"To bring back the NYPD at this time would be counterproductive, further inflaming what is happening on campus, and drawing thousands to our doorstep who would threaten our community," school leaders said in a statement, referring to the New York Police Department.

Canada saw its first campus protest camp spring up on Saturday at McGill University. 

The school in Montreal said such encampments, which are not permitted, increase "the potential for escalation and confrontation, as we have seen at some colleges throughout the US."

Hamas militants staged an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that left around 1,170 people dead, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.

Palestinian militants also took roughly 250 people hostage. Israel estimates 129 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,388 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[An ammunition explosion at a base in southwestern Cambodia killed 20 soldiers and wounded several others, Prime Minister Hun Manet said.

Hun Manet said in a Facebook post that he was “deeply shocked” when he received the news of the blast on Saturday afternoon at the base in Kampong Speu province. 

It wasn't immediately clear what caused it.

Images from the scene showed several badly damaged buildings still smoldering, at least one with its roof blown off, and soldiers receiving treatment in a hospital. 

Other photos showed houses with holes in their roofs.

Four buildings – three for storage and one work facility – were destroyed and several military vehicles damaged, Colonel Youeng Sokhon, an army officer at the site, said in a brief report to army chief General Mao Sophan, posted on social media. 

He added that 25 villagers' homes were damaged as well.

Kiripost, an online English language news service, quoted a nearby resident as saying a major explosion occurred at about 2.30pm, followed by smaller blasts for another hour.

Pheng Kimneang was quoted as saying the windows of a factory nearby were shattered, and homes as far as a kilometre (a half-mile) away suffered minor damage. Photos of the base show it in a large field, apparently with no civilian structures close by.

Hun Manet offered condolences to the soldiers’ families and promised the government would pay for their funerals and provide compensation both to those killed and those wounded. (AP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Hundreds of people protested in Australian cities on Saturday, demanding more be done to stop violence against women.

At events in Sydney and Adelaide, demonstrators carried banners saying "no excuse for abuse" and asked the government to step in and prevent violence that has claimed dozens of lives already this year.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese backed the protests and vowed to march at further events planned for Sunday.

"A woman has been killed every four days so far this year," he posted on social media.

"Tomorrow I will walk with women across Australia to say enough is enough."

"Governments need to do better, men need to step up and as a society, we must do better."

Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also took part in a demonstration in Sydney, and said change was desperately needed. 

The issue of violence against women has come to the fore in Australia after a spate of high-profile murder cases and a knife attack on a Sydney mall that left five women dead.

On Thursday, police arrested former "Home and Away" actor Orpheus Pledger, after he allegedly failed to appear in court to face charges of assaulting a woman.

Organisers in the advocacy group What Were You Wearing have called three days of protests from Friday to Sunday, saying "29 Women have been killed to men's violence since the start of 2024. Enough is enough." (AFP)]]>

    K-Pop director gets online backing after public rant

    <![CDATA[The creative director behind the girl band NewJeans has found online fame after a tearful, profanity-laced news conference in which she slammed some of K-pop's most powerful executives.

HYBE, the South Korean agency behind K-pop sensation BTS, filed a legal complaint on Thursday against Min Hee-jin, the head of its powerhouse subsidiary label ADOR, for breach of trust in business.

That followed an announcement three days earlier that it had launched an audit of ADOR and demanded that Min resign. HYBE's share price fell close to 10 percent after the audit was announced and closed on Friday down 4.95 percent.

Min, 44, hit back in a news conference on Thursday that drew empathy online from young working men and women who compared her story with their own experiences with unreasonable and jealous bosses who either took credit for their work or failed to acknowledge it fairly.

Others, however, said she had acted inappropriately and unprofessionally by occasionally lapsing into profanity.

She denied HYBE's accusations and claimed it was trying to dismiss her unfairly after she accused another of its subsidiaries, BELIFT LAB, of imitating NewJeans with a girl group of its own called ILLIT.

Min, speaking off the cuff and often breaking down in tears, candidly shared her frustrations for more than two hours.

She referred to HYBE's leaders, including chairman Bang Si-hyuk, the man behind BTS, as "gaejeossi", which translates roughly to a "middle-aged or old male fool".

"I feel betrayed by HYBE... they used me until I was no longer of use to them," she said.

The live-streamed event, during which even her lawyers appeared embarrassed, had millions of views and drew an explosive public response.

One parody YouTube video seen by 2.5 million viewers combined a clip of Min speaking passionately with hip-hop music. The t-shirt and baseball cap she was wearing sold out on several online platforms and many others said they had suffered similar experiences.

"Women who have truly worked (hard) and experienced being undermined by men, along with the dirty side of office politics, could never speak ill of Min Hee-jin," a South Korean woman said on social media platform X.

But Lee Moon-won, a culture critic who watched the news conference, said Min sidestepped the real allegations against her.

"No figure as influential as Min in the entertainment industry has ever used curse words during an official press conference, people have really never seen anything like it, so this obviously has attracted enormous attention," he told AFP.

Min, who joined the industry in the early 2000s, is widely regarded as one of the most successful producers in K-pop, having worked with stars such as Girls' Generation, EXO and SHINee.

NewJeans, a K-pop phenomenon that made its debut in 2022 and whose members are all under 20, is among HYBE's most successful K-pop groups along with BTS.

As one of few successful women producers in the industry, Min has been recognised for her arresting visual imagery on numerous K-pop hits, including Girls' Generation's "Gee" and EXO's "Growl".

NewJeans has topped global charts, including the Billboard 200, and broke the Guinness World Record last year for "Fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify".

Min said HYBE chairman Bang never congratulated her on NewJeans' debut and that the parent company had given promotional priority to another of its K-pop groups, Le Sserafim.

HYBE rejected Min's accusations and urged her again to resign and stop discussing NewJeans.

Some experts criticised both Min and HYBE over a scandal that has gripped much of South Korea.

K-pop columnist Isak Choi said those involved showed "incompetence and vulgarity by not hesitating to publicly display infighting".

Just because Min criticised HYBE's leadership, "it doesn't mean she is free from the rotten issues of this industry", Choi wrote on X.

"She cannot become the underdog simply because she is fighting with the management, especially after having gained astronomical benefits from within it." (AFP)]]>

    Hamas studies Israeli ceasefire counter proposal

    <![CDATA[Hamas said it was studying on Saturday the latest Israeli counter proposal regarding a potential ceasefire in Gaza, a day after a delegation from mediator Egypt reportedly arrived in Israel in a bid to jump-start stalled negotiations.

The signs of fresh truce talks came alongside ongoing Israeli preparations for a military push into Gaza's southern city of Rafah and as spillover from the war led to continued attacks across the region.

"Today, the Hamas movement received the official Zionist occupation response to the movement's position, which was delivered to the Egyptian and Qatari mediators on April 13," Khalil al-Hayya, deputy head of Hamas's political arm in Gaza, said in a brief statement early Saturday.

"The movement will study this proposal, and upon completion of its study, it will submit its response."

Hamas had previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire, something rejected by Israel.

Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been unsuccessfully trying to seal a new truce deal in Gaza ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.

Several Israeli media outlets, citing unnamed officials, said Israel's war cabinet had discussed a new plan for a truce and hostage release ahead of the Egyptian delegation's visit.

There has been "noticeable progress in bringing the views of the Egyptian and Israeli delegations closer", said Al-Qahera News, which is linked to Egyptian state intelligence services.

The war in Gaza was also on the agenda for an international summit set to kick off in Saudi Arabia over the weekend.

The World Economic Forum special meeting, scheduled to begin in Riyadh on Sunday, will include a Gaza-focused session on Monday set to feature newly appointed Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and Sigrid Kaag, the United Nations aid coordinator for the Gaza Strip.

"Discussions with European, American and regional counterparts on Gaza and the regional situation are planned in Riyadh," a diplomatic source said on Friday.

Witnesses in besieged Gaza reported fresh Israeli strikes overnight into Saturday around Rafah, the last urban centre Israeli ground forces have yet to enter.

Plans for an Israeli incursion into the city, which military leaders say is necessary to uproot Hamas battalions, have sparked opposition among the international community due to the presence of hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians seeking refuge there.

Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told AFP on Thursday that such an operation "will undoubtedly threaten the negotiations" and show "that Israel is interested in continuing the war".

The war began with the unprecedented Hamas attack on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,170 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,356 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.

Israel estimates that 129 hostages are still being held by Hamas in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead. (AFP)]]>

    Trump lawyers cross examine ex-tabloid publisher

    <![CDATA[A former tabloid publisher who squashed potentially embarrassing stories about Donald Trump was back on the witness stand on Friday being grilled by lawyers of the former US president.

David Pecker, 72, has testified for four days in the trial of Trump, accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter that could have derailed his 2016 White House campaign.

Pecker, the first witness in the blockbuster trial, has outlined under questioning from prosecutors a scheme known as "catch and kill," which involved purchasing and then burying salacious stories which could have been damaging to the real estate tycoon.

Trump, 77, the first former US president to face criminal charges, is accused of engaging in "election fraud" by having his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen make a US$130,000 payment to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton.

The high-stakes trial requires Trump to report to the drafty Manhattan courtroom multiple times a week, restricting his time on the campaign trail less than seven months before his likely election rematch with President Joe Biden.

Speaking to reporters in a hallway before entering court on Friday, Trump wished his wife, Melania, a happy birthday.

"It'd be nice to be with her but I'm at a courthouse for a rigged trial," he said.

Pecker, whose outlets included the National Enquirer tabloid, testified this week about a hush money payment to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claimed to have had a year-long affair with Trump that was a precursor to the Daniels saga.

Pecker explained how transfers to the tune of US$150,000 were made to "catch and kill" McDougal's story and suppress its publication, calling it a "large purchase" relative to the sums his company would normally pay for content.

He said payments to McDougal were disguised as services to American Media, the tabloid's parent company, to avoid violating campaign finance laws.

"We purchased the story so it would not be published by any other organization," Pecker told the jury. "We didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or hurt his campaign."

McDougal's story ultimately did come out, four days before the election in a scoop from The Wall Street Journal.

Pecker said Trump called him and was "very upset."

When it came to squashing Daniels' tale of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, Pecker said he hesitated to pay for yet another story.

"I'm not a bank," he said.

The executive suggested to Cohen that he pay for it instead, which prosecutors say the then-Trump fixer did.

The specific charge facing Trump of falsifying business records stems from his reimbursements to Cohen for the payment to Daniels.

During defence cross-examination which began on Thursday, Emil Bove, a Trump attorney sought to ruffle Pecker by noting timeline inconsistencies, while also casting the "catch and kill" tactics described by prosecutors as "business as usual."

Trump has appeared increasingly disgruntled, angry even, as the trial proceeds.

He complained on Friday that the courtroom was "freezing" and that it was "on purpose I believe."

In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

He also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[British head of state King Charles III will make a limited return to public duties next week, after doctors said they were "very encouraged" by the progress of his treatment for cancer.

His first engagement with Queen Camilla would be to a cancer treatment centre on Tuesday. The couple will also host Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan for a state visit in June.

The announcement follows a difficult spell for the royal family after both Charles, 75, and his 42-year-old daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, revealed that they had cancer.

Catherine, the wife of heir to the throne Prince William, made the shock announcement that she was undergoing preventative chemotherapy just over a month ago in a video posted to social media.

Announcing Charles's limited return, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said it was "too early to say" how much longer his treatment would continue.

But they noted that his medical team were "very encouraged by the progress made so far and remain positive about the king's continued recovery".

"The pacing of the king's programme will be carefully calibrated as his recovery continues, in close consultation with his medical team," the spokesperson added.

The king and Queen Camilla will host the Japanese royal couple at Buckingham Palace in late June, the palace said, confirming reports in the Japanese media last month.

The Japanese royals both attended the state funeral of Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in September 2022, in their first overseas trip after the emperor's enthronement.

They also attended the reception the king hosted at Buckingham Palace the evening before the funeral for heads of state and official overseas guests.

An earlier state visit which had been planned for early 2020 had to be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. (AFP)]]>

    Biden 'happy to debate' Trump

    <![CDATA[Joe Biden said on Friday he's ready to face off against his White House challenger Donald Trump in a debate ahead of their likely presidential rematch in November.

Candidate debates have been important milestones in US presidential elections for decades, helping make or break voters' opinions of the contestants' personal style and demeanor as much as their policy chops.

But Biden's team has for months been non-committal about his willingness to participate in the tradition, which is usually held in front of an audience and moderated by a well-known journalist.

"I am happy to debate him," Biden told radio host Howard Stern Friday.

"I am, somewhere. I don't know when," he said.

"Ok, let's set it up!" Trump campaign advisor Chis LaCivita said on X, formerly Twitter, in response to Biden's comments.

Presumptive Republican nominee Trump declined to face off against his primary opponents in any debates during the 2024 cycle.

But he has indicated his eagerness with the man who beat him in 2020, saying on social media earlier this year that he was ready to hold a presidential debate with Biden "ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE!"

Biden, who has branded Trump as a threat to democracy, told reporters last month that any agreement to debate the real estate mogul "depends on his behaviour."

The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) has already arranged three dates and locations for Trump and Biden to go head-to-head for the 2024 fight, at US universities throughout the country in September and October.

But Trump bashed the CPD as being biased toward Democrat Biden when in 2020 it planned to move a third and final debate to a virtual format amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Then-president Trump had himself shown up to the second 2020 debate against Biden only three days before testing positive for Covid.

Biden at the time had said he would not participate in another in-person debate with Trump while the Republican was still ill.

A verbal spar could be a useful opportunity for both the 77-year-old former president and 81-year-old current president to display stamina, as Biden is still dogged by Trump's old "Sleepy Joe" nickname -- and Trump faced online teasing when he appeared to nod off during his criminal trial in New York last week.

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping said there was reason for optimism in the development of China-US relations as he met America's top diplomat in Beijing on Friday.

According to state media, the president told Antony Blinken that progress had been made over the past few months in stabilising ties between the two countries.

Xi said the two nations should be "partners, not rivals", and should seek common ground while reserving differences and avoid descending into vicious competition, adding: "there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved, and there is still room for further efforts."

The president also said that "China would be pleased to see a confident and open, prosperous and developing United States".

"We hope the US can also take a positive view of China's development," he added.

"When this fundamental problem is solved... relations can truly stabilise, get better, and move forward." (Reuters/AFP)]]>
