    <![CDATA[The EU's climate monitor on Wednesday said last month was the hottest April on record and the 11th consecutive month of historic global heat.

Oceans were also overheating with April marking the 13th straight monthly high for sea surface temperatures, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).

Each month since June 2023 has ranked as the planet's hottest on record, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, the C3S said in a monthly bulletin.

Including April, the world's average temperature was the highest on record for a 12-month period - 1.61 degrees Celsius above the average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.

Some of the extremes - including months of record breaking sea surface temperatures - have led scientists to investigate whether human activity has now triggered a tipping point in the climate system.

"I think many scientists have asked the question whether there could be a shift in the climate system," said Julien Nicolas, C3S Senior Climate Scientist.

Still, the EU's climate monitor also said the natural El Nino phenomenon which warms the Pacific Ocean and contributes to hotter weather globally "continued to weaken" in April towards more "neutral conditions". (Reuters/AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Protests by students demanding universities sever ties with Israel over the Gaza war spread across western Europe on Tuesday, sparking clashes and dozens of fresh arrests.

Students at various European universities, inspired by ongoing demonstrations at US campuses, have been occupying halls and facilities, demanding an end to partnerships with Israeli institutions because of Israel's punishing assault on Gaza.

Several hundred protesters resumed a demonstration around the University of Amsterdam campus, where police the previous night were filmed baton-charging them and smashing up their tents after they refused to leave the grounds.

As protests resumed on Tuesday night, demonstrators erected barriers to access routes watched over by a heavy police deployment.

Police said in a statement that a total of 169 people had been arrested when officers broke up Monday night's protests.

All had been released apart from two still in custody on suspicion of public disorder offences.

Violence had briefly erupted Monday when a small group of counter-protesters wielding flares stormed the main protest.

Around 50 demonstrators were also protesting Tuesday outside the library in Utrecht University and a few dozen at the Technical University of Delft, according to local news agency ANP.

In the eastern German city of Leipzig, the university said in a statement that 50 to 60 people occupied a lecture hall on Tuesday, waving banners that read: "University occupation against genocide".

Protesters barricaded the lecture hall doors from the inside and erected tents in the courtyard, according to the university.

The institution called in the police in the afternoon, and filed a criminal complaint.

Criminal proceedings have been initiated against 13 people who were in the lecture hall on suspicion of trespassing. No arrests have been made so far.

Earlier, at Berlin's Free University, police cleared a demonstration after up to 80 people erected a protest camp in a courtyard of the campus.

The protesters, some of whom wore the keffiyeh scarf that has long been a symbol of the Palestinian cause, sat in front of tents and waved banners.

They later tried to enter rooms and lecture halls and occupy them, according to the university, which said it then called in police to clear the protest.

The university said property was damaged while classes in some buildings were suspended for the day. Berlin police said they made some arrests for incitement to hatred and trespassing.

In Paris, police twice intervened at the prestigious Sciences Po university to disperse about 20 students who had barricaded themselves in the main hall.

Security forces moved in to allow other students to take their exams and made two arrests, according to Paris prosecutors.

The university said exams proceeded without incident.

At the nearby Sorbonne university building, police late Tuesday moved to eject about 100 students who had occupied an amphitheatre and made 88 arrests, police sources said.

In Switzerland, protests spread to three universities in Lausanne, Geneva and Zurich.

The University of Lausanne said in a statement it "considers that there is no reason to cease these relations" with Israeli universities as protesters demand.

In Austria, dozens of protesters have been camped on the campus of Vienna University, pitching tents and stringing up banners since late Thursday. (AFP)]]>

    US police clear pro-Palestinian tent encampment

    <![CDATA[Police in riot gear cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at the University of Chicago on Tuesday after administrators who had initially adopted a permissive approach said the protest had crossed a line and caused growing concerns about safety.

University president Paul Alivisatos issued a message after officers blocked access to the school's Quad.

“The university remains a place where dissenting voices have many avenues to express themselves, but we cannot enable an environment where the expression of some dominates and disrupts the healthy functioning of the community for the rest,” he wrote.

Hundreds of protesters had gathered for at least eight days at the university until campus administrators warned them on Friday to leave the area or face removal.

On Tuesday, law enforcement dismantled the encampment. Officers later picked up a barricade erected to keep protesters out of the Quad and moved it toward the demonstrators, some of whom chanted, “Up, up with liberation. Down, down with occupation!”

Tensions have continued to ratchet up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the US — and increasingly, in Europe — nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University. 

Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.

Some colleges have cracked down immediately on protests against the Israel-Hamas war.

Since April 18, just over 2,600 people have been arrested on the campuses of 50 colleges and universities, according to figures based on reporting by the Associated Press and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.

As pro-Palestinian protests continue to spread, the White House said President Joe Biden welcomes peaceful protests at college commencement ceremonies where he and other administration officials will speak.

White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden welcomed peaceful protests on campuses and elsewhere, but would continue to condemn hate speech, antisemitism or violence.

"We have been very clear. We believe all Americans should have the right to peacefully protest," she added. "What we don't want to see is hate speech, violence."

Biden is due to give a commencement speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on May 19.

He warned on Tuesday that the threat of antisemitism is growing in the United States, including on college campuses, joining a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.

Biden last week addressed the campus unrest, saying Americans have the right to protest "but not a right to cause chaos" through vandalism, breaking windows or shutting down campuses. (Agencies)]]>

    UN atomic chief bemoans lack of cooperation from Iran

    <![CDATA[UN atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi on Tuesday decried "completely unsatisfactory" cooperation from Tehran after returning from Iran where he urged leaders to adopt "concrete" measures to address concerns over its nuclear programme.

Grossi's visit came at a time of heightened regional tensions and with his International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) criticising Iran for lack of cooperation on inspections and other outstanding issues.

"The present state is completely unsatisfactory for me. We are almost at an impasse and this needs to be changed," Grossi told reporters at the airport in Vienna, where the IAEA is based.

He said there was no "magic wand" to solve a "very, very complex set of issues," while he pressed the Islamic republic to "deliver very soon."

"But of course, for me and also I would say for the international community, there is a need to have some results sooner rather than later," he said.

Earlier on Tuesday, at a news conference in the Iranian city of Isfahan, Grossi said he had proposed to Iranian officials that they "focus on the very concrete, very practical and tangible measures that can be implemented in order to accelerate" cooperation.

Grossi held talks with senior Iranian officials including Atomic Energy Organisation's head Mohammad Eslami and spoke at Iran's first International Conference on Nuclear Science and Technology held in Isfahan.

Grossi insisted on the need to "settle differences" on the nuclear issue while the Middle East was going through "difficult times", particularly the war between Israel and the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

"Sometimes, political conditions pose obstacles to full-fledged cooperation" between Iran and the international community, Grossi told reporters.

Grossi said a March 2023 agreement with Iran was "still valid" but required more "substance."

The agreement was reached during Grossi's last visit to Iran and outlined basic cooperation measures including on safeguards and monitoring.

The IAEA chief said, however, that there had been a "slowdown" in the agreement's implementation, including Iran reducing the number of inspections and withdrawing the accreditation of a group of IAEA experts.

Iran suspended compliance with a landmark 2015 deal setting caps on nuclear activities after the United States unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and reimposed sweeping sanctions. (AFP)]]>

    Canadian police probe shooting near Drake's home

    <![CDATA[Canadian police on Tuesday were investigating a pre-dawn shooting at the home of superstar rapper Drake, whose sprawling property in a tiny Toronto neighbourhood remained cordoned off.

Police inspector Paul Krawczyk said a security guard at the mansion on The Bridle Path road was taken to hospital with serious injuries sustained from an apparent gunshot wound after suspects in a vehicle opened fire.

The shooting, captured on grainy security camera footage that has not been released to the public, happened at 2:09 am (0609 GMT).

The guard was standing outside the gates in front of the residence when the shooting occurred, Krawczyk told reporters.

"I cannot confirm if Drake was home at the time the incident occurred, but I can tell you that we are in contact with his team and they are cooperating," the inspector added.

He said the suspects fled in the vehicle, but no descriptions were offered.

Police taped off most of the area. Several small orange markers, believed to indicate locations of shell casings, could be seen scattered on the road's edge in front of the mansion.

The 37-year-old Drake, known for hits such as "God's Plan" and "Hotline Bling," was the highest-grossing rapper in the world last year.

He is currently embroiled in a feud with Kendrick Lamar, with the rappers exchanging barbed "diss tracks" that have drawn widespread attention.

Beefs are nothing new in hip-hop, a genre long known both for its artists' boasts and their strongly worded takedowns of rivals.

There was no indication that the shooting had any relation to the rap battle.

Asked about the bad blood between Drake and Kendrick Lamar, Krawczyk said he was aware of it, but added, "it is so early in the investigation that we don't have a motive at this time, and so I cannot comment further on that." (AFP)]]>

    Stormy Daniels takes witness stand at Trump trial

    <![CDATA[Stormy Daniels, the porn star at the heart of Donald Trump's hush money case, took the witness stand on Tuesday at the blockbuster trial of the former US president.

"The people call Stormy Daniels," prosecutor Susan Hoffinger announced as the 77-year-old Trump sat at the defence table in the Manhattan courtroom flanked by his lawyers.

Daniels' testimony is expected to be a pivotal moment in the courtroom drama rocking the scandal-plagued Republican's attempt to recapture the White House.

Daniels, 45, a long-time actor and director in the adult film industry, says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and was then paid to keep quiet about it on the eve of his 2016 election against Hillary Clinton, when the news could have sunk his campaign.

Trump denies ever having sex with Daniels and Susan Necheles, a lawyer for the former president, lodged an objection with the judge presiding over the trial to allowing her to testify about any "sexual acts."

"It is unduly prejudicial," Necheles told Judge Juan Merchan.

Hoffinger said Daniels' testimony would not be graphic and would "omit details that are too salacious."

Prosecutors say that Trump – desperate to kill Daniels' story before it could wreck his chances in the narrow 2016 race – illegally reimbursed his fixer and lawyer, Michael Cohen, to cover up the US$130,000 hush money payment.

He is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.

Cohen, who has become a vocal critic of his former boss, is also expected to testify at the trial as a prosecution witness. (AFP)]]>

    Macron hosts Xi Jinping in French mountains

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping on Tuesday continued his state visit to France by visiting the Pyrenees mountains, where he met his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.

At the Tarbes-Lourdes Pyrenees airport, Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, were greeted by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, who took them to lunch high up in the mountains.

After watching traditional dancers perform under the snowy peaks, they ate locally grown ham, lamb, cheese and blueberry pie. Xi said he would give the ham some publicity and also praised the cheese.

Macron gifted Xi a woollen blanket made in the Pyrenees, a Tour de France jersey and armagnac from the nearby southwestern region.

Advisers to the French president described the Pyrenees trip as breaking with protocol for a chance for one-on-one chats with Xi in mountains dear to Macron as the birthplace of his maternal grandmother.

Xi has said he would welcome more high-level talks on trade frictions, and has denied there was a Chinese "overcapacity problem". 

Macron has made trade a priority in the talks, underscoring that Europe must defend its "strategic interests" in its economic relations with China.

Meanwhile, Chinese and French companies had concluded some agreements on Monday ranging from energy, finance and transport on the sidelines of Xi's visit, but most were agreements to cooperate or renewed commitments to work together, and there were no significant deals.

In a sign of some progress, China will allow imports of pig origin protein feed as well as pork offal from France effective immediately, according to statements from Chinese customs and the French farm ministry.

But European hopes of an Airbus plane order to coincide with Xi's visit appear to have been dashed, with the two sides agreeing only to expand co-operation.

Xi travels later on Tuesday to Serbia. 

Writing in Serbian daily Politika ahead of arriving in Belgrade, Xi criticised Nato for its "flagrant" bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in 1999, warning Beijing would "never allow such tragic history to repeat itself". (Reuters/AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[German police on Tuesday broke up a protest by several hundred pro-Palestinian activists who had occupied a courtyard at Berlin’s Free University earlier in the day, the latest such action by authorities as protests that have roiled campuses in the United States spread across Europe.

The protesters had put up about 20 tents and formed a human chain around them. Most had covered their faces with medical masks and had draped kufiyah scarves around their heads, shouting slogans such as “Viva, viva Palestina”.

Police had called on the students via loudspeakers to leave the campus, and officers could also be seen carrying some students away, and using pepper spray against some of the protesters.

The school's administrators said in a statement that the protesters had rejected any kind of dialogue and they had therefore called in police to clear the campus.

“This form of protest is not geared towards dialogue. An occupation is not acceptable on the Free University Berlin campus,” university president Guenter Ziegler said.

The administrators said some protesters attempted to enter rooms and lecture halls at Free University in order to occupy them.

In recent days, students have held protests or set up encampments in Finland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France and Britain, following earlier protests at US campuses. (AP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Vladimir Putin began his fifth term on Tuesday as Russian leader at a glittering Kremlin inauguration, setting out on another six years in office.

Already in office for nearly a quarter-century, and the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, Putin’s new term doesn’t expire until 2030, when he will be constitutionally eligible to run again.

At the ceremony inside the gilded Grand Kremlin Palace, Putin placed his hand on the Russian Constitution and vowed to defend it as a crowd of hand-picked dignitaries looked on.

At 71, Putin dominates the domestic political landscape. 

On the international stage, he is locked in a confrontation with Western countries he accuses of using Ukraine as a vehicle to try to defeat and dismember Russia.

Putin in March won a landslide victory in a tightly controlled election from which two anti-war candidates were barred on technical grounds.

His best known opponent, Alexei Navalny, died suddenly in an Arctic penal colony a month earlier, and other leading critics are in jail or have been forced to flee abroad.

Putin first became Russian leader in late 1999, when he succeeded Boris Yeltsin as president. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[Dutch riot police ended a pro-Palestinian demonstration at an Amsterdam university early on Tuesday, arresting some 125 people in sometimes violent clashes, authorities said.

In messages posted overnight on social media X, police said they had to act to stop the event and dismantle tents that been set up by protesters, who used violence against police at the site at the University of Amsterdam.

"The police's input was necessary to restore order. We see the footage on social media. We understand that those images may appear as intense," police said.

Local media showed demonstrators shooting fireworks at police officers but there were no immediate reports of injuries on either side.

"All is now quiet... police stay in the vicinity of the Roeterseiland campus," police said later on X.

Outgoing Education minister Robbert Dijkgraaf said universities are a place for dialogue and debate and he was sad to see that police had to intervene.

Student protests over the war and academic ties with Israel have begun to spread across Europe, but have remained much smaller in scale than those seen in the United States. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Israeli army said it took "operational control" of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Tuesday and that troops were scanning the area.

"Right now we have special forces scanning the crossing... We have operational control of the area and other crossings and we have special forces scanning the area," the military said.

"We are only talking about the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing."

The Israeli 401st Brigade entered the Rafah crossing early Tuesday morning, the Israeli military said, taking “operational control” of the crucial crossing for both aid and those able to flee into Egypt.

Footage released by the Israeli military showed a tank entering the crossing. Details of the video matched known features of the crossing and showed Israeli flags flying from tanks that seized the area.

The Israeli military claimed it seized the crossing after receiving intelligence it was “being used for terrorist purposes.” 

The military did not provide evidence to immediately support the assertion, though it alleged the area around the crossing had been used to launch a mortar attack that killed four Israeli troops and wounded others near the Kerem Shalom Crossing.

The military also said that ground troops and airstrikes targeted suspected Hamas positions in Rafah. 

Egypt previously warned any seizure of Rafah could see Palestinians fleeing over the border, a scenario that could threaten a 1979 peace deal with Israel that’s been a linchpin for regional security.

The offensive again raised the risks of an all-out Israeli assault on Rafah, a move that aid groups warn will be disastrous for some 1.4 million Palestinians taking refuge there.

Egyptian officials said the proposal called for a cease-fire of multiple stages starting with a limited hostage release and partial Israeli troop pullbacks within Gaza. 

The two sides would also negotiate a “permanent calm” that would lead to a full hostage release and greater Israeli withdrawal out of the territory, they said.

The Hamas militant group, which controls Gaza, has sought clearer guarantees for its key demand of an end to the war and complete Israeli withdrawal in return for the release of all hostages. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[An Australian woman, accused of killing her in-laws with a toxic mushroom-laced beef Wellington, pleaded not guilty to a raft of murder charges on Tuesday, court officials said.

Erin Patterson faces three counts of murder for allegedly dishing up a poisonous meal in July 2023 that killed her parents-in-law, as well as the wife of a local pastor.

The 49-year-old, who is also accused of attempting to kill her estranged husband four times, indicated to a Melbourne court that she would fight the charges.

Court officials said the case, which has captured headlines around the world, would now be fast-tracked for trial at the Supreme Court of Victoria.

Patterson allegedly served the beef Wellington to her estranged parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, as well as local Baptist pastor Ian Wilkinson, 69, and his wife Heather Wilkinson, 66.

Police have previously suggested the meal she served included lethal death cap mushrooms.

Three of the lunch guests -- Don and Gail Patterson, and Heather Wilkinson -- died in the days following the meal.

Ian Wilkinson recovered after spending nearly two months in hospital.

Detectives said husband Simon Patterson also "became ill after meals" served by his estranged wife on four separate occasions in 2021 and 2022 -- and have charged Erin Patterson with his attempted murder. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner spaceship was dramatically postponed around two hours before launch after a new safety issue was identified, officials said Monday, in a fresh blow to the US aerospace giant.

Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were already strapped in their seats preparing for lift-off when the call for a "scrub" came, in order to give engineers time to investigate anomalous readings from an oxygen relief valve on the second stage of the rocket.

"Standing down on tonight's attempt to launch," tweeted NASA chief Bill Nelson. "As I've said before, @NASA's first priority is safety. We go when we're ready."

The mission comes at a challenging time for Boeing, as a safety crisis engulfs its commercial aviation division.

The test flight, which has already experienced years of delays, is a crucial step for the space agency, which has long sought a second commercial partner to carry astronauts to the International Space Station.

Elon Musk's SpaceX achieved the feat with its Dragon capsule in 2020, ending a nearly decade-long dependence on Russian rockets following the end of the Space Shuttle program.

Clad in Boeing's bright blue spacesuits, the astronauts were helped out of the spaceship then boarded a van to leave the launch tower at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, returning to their quarters.

The next possible launch window is on Tuesday, then Friday and Saturday, assuming the issue is resolved.

Starliner will be propelled into orbit by an Atlas V rocket made by United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture. Once in space, the crew will take the helm, piloting the craft manually to test its capabilities.

The astronauts, both Navy-trained pilots and space program veterans, have each been to the ISS twice, traveling once on a shuttle and then aboard a Russian Soyuz vessel.

Starliner, a gumdrop-shaped capsule with a cabin about as roomy as an SUV, is scheduled to rendezvous with the ISS for a week-long stay.

Williams and Wilmore will conduct a series of tests to verify the capsule's functionality before returning to Earth for a parachute-assisted landing in the western United States.

A successful mission would help dispel the bitter taste left by numerous setbacks in the Starliner programme.

In 2019, during a first uncrewed test flight, software defects meant the capsule was not placed on the right trajectory and returned without reaching the ISS. "Ground intervention prevented loss of vehicle," said NASA in the aftermath, chiding Boeing for inadequate safety checks.

Then in 2021, with the rocket on the launchpad for a new flight, blocked valves forced another postponement.

The vessel finally reached the ISS in May 2022 in a non-crewed launch. But other problems that came to light -- including weak parachutes and flammable tape in the cabin that needed to be removed -- caused further delays to the crewed test flight, necessary for the capsule to be certified for NASA use on regular ISS missions.

SpaceX's Dragon capsule joined that exclusive club four years ago, following the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs.

In 2014, the agency awarded fixed-price contracts of US$4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.6 billion to SpaceX to develop the capsules under its Commercial Crew Program.

This marked a shift in NASA's approach from owning space flight hardware to instead paying private partners for their services as the primary customer.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk took a swipe at Boeing, gloating that his company "finished 4 years sooner" despite receiving a smaller contract. He attributed Boeing's delay to "too many non-technical managers" in a post on X.

Once Starliner is fully operational, NASA hopes to alternate between SpaceX and Boeing vessels to taxi humans to the ISS.

Even though the orbital lab is due to be mothballed in 2030, both Starliner and Dragon could be used for future private space stations that several companies are developing. (AFP)]]>

    Russia announces nuclear drills, threatens UK targets

    <![CDATA[Russia announced on Monday that its troops stationed near Ukraine would run nuclear weapons drills and threatened to strike UK military targets outside the embattled country, citing what it said was an escalation in Western sabre-rattling.

The defence ministry announced the drills and also said Russian forces had captured two villages in eastern Ukraine, where outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian troops have been struggling to hold their positions.

Officials in the border region of Belgorod meanwhile said that Ukrainian aerial attacks had left at least seven people dead and wounded over 30, including several children.

Putin, who ordered the nuclear drills, has upped his nuclear rhetoric since ordering his army into Ukraine in 2022, warning in February there was a "real" risk of nuclear war.

The defence ministry gave no date for the exercises, but said they would involve the air force, navy and troops stationed near Ukraine.

It said they were aimed at ensuring Russian territorial integrity in the face of Western "threats."

The Kremlin specified that the exercises were a response to statements by French President Emmanuel Macron and British officials.

Russia has in recent days hit out at Macron for telling The Economist magazine he was "not ruling anything out" in the West's response to the conflict in Ukraine, including sending troops to the country.

It has also blasted UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron for saying Kyiv has the right to strike targets inside Russia. (AFP)]]>

    Biden speaks with Netanyahu as Rafah invasion looms

    <![CDATA[President Joe Biden held urgent talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday after Israel defied repeated US warnings and told Palestinians to evacuate part of the southern Gaza city of Rafah ahead of an offensive.

The call came as Biden mounts a diplomatic offensive to get ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas back on track, with Jordan's King Abdullah II due at the White House for lunch on Monday.

Biden told Netanyahu in April that invading Rafah would be a "mistake," and Washington has said it does not support an offensive without a credible plan to protect some 1.2 million civilians sheltering there.

The White House confirmed that "President Biden spoke today with Prime Minister Netanyahu," and said it would release a readout with details of the call soon.

Biden did not respond to shouted questions and walked straight to the Oval Office from his helicopter, Marine One, after arriving back at the White House from a weekend at his family home in Wilmington, Delaware.

A spokesman for the US National Security Council, announcing earlier that the call would take place, said "we have made our views clear on a major ground invasion of Rafah to the Israeli government."

"We continue to believe that a hostage deal is the best way to preserve the lives of the hostages, and avoid an invasion of Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering," the spokesman said.

"Those talks are ongoing now."

Biden is under growing domestic pressure about the war in Gaza in an election year, with pro-Palestinian protests roiling US university campuses in recent weeks.

New York's prestigious Columbia University, which has been at the heart of the protests, said on Monday it had canceled the main graduation ceremony for students next week. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Scottish political veteran John Swinney on Monday was named head of the pro-independence SNP party, leaving him poised to become Scotland's new leader.

Swinney, 60, said on X, formerly Twitter, he was "deeply honoured to have been elected as leader of the SNP" after Humza Yousaf resigned last week after little more than a year as Scottish leader and head of the Scottish National Party (SNP).

The SNP confirmed Swinney's election after nominations for the post closed at noon (1100 GMT) without any other challengers emerging.

He told reporters later that alongside advancing the case for Scottish independence his key policy idea was the eradication of child poverty.

"It is a curse and under my leadership I want to eradicate it in Scotland," he said.

On independence he said the party would "get our act together" to win back the votes of supporters who may have turned away from the party in recent years.

Humza stepped down last Monday as he faced a confidence vote in the Scottish parliament that he was set to lose having ditched his junior coalition partners, the Scottish Green Party, in a row over climate policy.

Swinney, an old party hand who led the SNP from 2000 to 2004 when the nationalists were in opposition, will now face a vote in the Scottish parliament later this week.

But he inherits a difficult political legacy, with former SNP leader and ally Nicola Sturgeon embroiled in a party funding scandal and a challenging domestic policy landscape. (AFP)]]>

    Judge threatens Trump with jail

    <![CDATA[The judge overseeing Donald Trump's criminal trial on Monday said he would hold the former president in contempt of court for a 10th time for violating a gag order, and warned he would consider jailing him for any further violations.

Justice Juan Merchan said the nine fines he had imposed so far did not seem to be deterring Trump from violating the gag order, which prohibits him from making public comments about jurors, witnesses and families of the judge and prosecutors if the statements mean to interfere with the case.

Merchan said he considered jail time “truly the last resort” for many reasons, including the disruption to the trial, the political implications of jailing a leading presidential candidate ahead of an election and the extraordinary security challenges of incarcerating an ex-president with a lifetime Secret Service detail.

But he said Trump’s “continued, willful” violations of the gag order amounted to a “direct attack on the rule of law.”

“I do not want to impose a jail sanction and have done everything I can to avoid doing so. But I will if necessary,” Merchan said from the bench in the absence of the jury.

New York law allows fines of up to US$1,000 or jail time of up to 30 days for violating a court-imposed gag order. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping on Monday attended a China-France-EU trilateral meeting with French leader Emmanuel Macron and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at the Elysee Palace in Paris.

Xi said China regarded Europe as an important partner in helping it achieve its modernisation goals and said the two sides should stay committed to their partnership.

The president added China regarded Europe as a priority of its foreign policy, and sees China-EU relations from a strategic and long-term perspective.

Xi's French counterpart, Macron, said the international situation made EU-China dialogue more essential than ever, adding it was important to ensure a level playing field between the two sides.

Trade, Sino-European relations, the war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East dominated talks between the three leaders.

Macron said coordination with Beijing on "major crises" including Ukraine was "absolutely decisive".

Xi said China had been working "vigorously" to facilitate talks for peace in Ukraine while adding that Beijing was ready to work with the EU to support a more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 

On trade, Macron urged "fair rules for all" while the EU's von der Leyen said relations between Brussels and Beijing were challenged over issues linked to market access. 

Xi said whether viewed from the perspective of comparative advantage or global market demand, there was no such thing as "China's overcapacity problem". (Xinhua/Reuters)

    <![CDATA[The Israeli army said Monday it was evacuating about 100,000 people from eastern Rafah, ahead of an expected ground assault in the southern city of Gaza.

"The estimate is around 100,000 people," a military spokesman told journalists when asked how many people were being evacuated.

About 1.2 million people are currently sheltering in Rafah, according to the World Health Organisation, most having fled there from elsewhere in Gaza during the seven-month war between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants.

The evacuation "is part of our plans to dismantle Hamas... we had a violent reminder of their presence and their operational abilities in Rafah yesterday," the military spokesman said.

"This is an evacuation plan to get people out of harm's way."

On Sunday, three Israeli soldiers were killed and a dozen wounded, the army said, when a barrage of rockets was fired towards the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza.

The army said the rockets were fired from an area adjacent to Rafah.

The soldiers were hit while guarding heavy machinery, tanks and bulldozers stationed in the area.

Rain fell on Monday as the army airdropped leaflets advising about the evacuation, an AFP correspondent said.

Hamas's armed wing claimed the rocket attack, which led Israeli authorities to close the crossing, used to deliver aid into Gaza. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Eurovision 2024 began in the Swedish city of Malmo on Sunday when 37 contenders walked the "Turquoise Carpet" amid heightened security and calls for boycotts due to Israel's participation.

The 68th version of the song contest, which is always billed as non-political, is taking place against the backdrop of the devastating Israeli military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel.

Much focus is expected to be on Israeli contestant Eden Golan, when she performs her song "Hurricane" in the second semi-final on Thursday, with bookmakers placing the entry among the top 10 to win the competition.

The Israeli delegation did not attend the carpet on Sunday due to Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel, said Swedish broadcaster SVT, which co-organises the contest with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).

Israel agreed to modify the lyrics of its original song "October Rain", which the EBU said made reference to the October 7 Hamas onslaught.

The contest comprises three live shows, with half a dozen countries having a shot at the title this year, according to fans and bookmakers.

Sweden's Loreen won the 2023 competition in Liverpool, northern England, with her song "Tattoo", granting the Nordic country an automatic entry into next Saturday's grand final.

The "Big Five" of the EBU - the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy - are also automatically given a spot in the final, while the other contenders will compete in semi-finals for the remaining places.

It will be the seventh time Sweden is hosting the song contest after last doing so in 2016, and the third time Malmo will stage the competition.

Sweden's participants for this year, twins Marcus & Martinus, were drawn in March to open the final with their dance pop song "Unforgettable". (Reuters)]]>
