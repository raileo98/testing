    <![CDATA[South Korean military on Monday said North Korea fired an unidentified ballistic missile into the sea off South Korea's east coast, the latest in an apparent volley of tests by Pyongyang this year.

"North Korea has fired an unidentified missile into the East Sea," South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.

Tokyo also confirmed the launch, with the Japanese defence ministry saying "a suspected ballistic missile was launched from North Korea" in a post on X, formerly Twitter.

Japanese media reported the suspected missile fell outside Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone.

Seoul-based specialist site NK News said the "brief flight time, likely under 10 minutes, pointed to the launch involving a short-range ballistic missile or a multiple launch rocket system."

The latest launch comes after UN sanctions monitoring against the nuclear-armed nation was upended last month by Russia. (AFP)]]>

    PNG people didn't eat your uncle, leader tells Biden

    <![CDATA[Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape says his nation does not deserve to be labelled cannibals, and urged the US to clear up the remnants of the Second World War littered across the Pacific, after comments by President Joe Biden about his missing serviceman uncle.

Biden had "appeared to imply his uncle was eaten by cannibals after his plane was shot down over PNG during WWII", Marape's office said in a statement late on Sunday.

"President Biden's remarks may have been a slip of the tongue; however, my country does not deserve to be labelled as such," Marape said in the statement.

"I urge President Biden to get the White House to look into cleaning up these remains of WWII so the truth about missing servicemen like Ambrose Finnegan can be put to rest."

Biden has previously cited his personal connection with Papua New Guinea's wartime history on visits to Australia, telling the story of his uncle who died in a plane crash in May 1944.

Biden last week raised the possibility his uncle might have fallen victim to cannibals, after visiting a missing-in-action war memorial in Pennsylvania.

Historians say Papua New Guinea was crucial to the United States drive across the Pacific to liberate the Philippines in the Second World War, while Australia has said the wartime history showed the renewed strategic importance of its northern neighbour.

The impact of the war remains sensitive among Pacific Islanders, however. Marape said his nation was "needlessly dragged into a conflict that was not their doing".

Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands remain littered with wartime human remains, plane wrecks, ship wrecks and tunnels, as well as leftover bombs which were still killing people, he said. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[China's ambassador to the United States said on Saturday that the two countries need to keep working to improve relations amid "unprecedented challenges".

Xie Feng made the comments at Harvard University ahead of a visit to Beijing this week by the top US diplomat, Antony Blinken.

“Whether the younger generation can continue to enjoy the eight-decade-long peace and development as their parents did depends largely on whether China and the United States can find the right way to get along in the new era,” Xie said in comments released by the embassy on Sunday.

Xie said talks in California between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, in November had injected stability into the bilateral relationship and also formed a forward-looking “San Francisco vision”. 

“Since the meeting, the two sides have maintained interactions at various levels, and conducted dialogue and cooperation in areas including foreign policy, economy and trade, law enforcement, agriculture, and [military to military] relations,” Xie was quoted by the embassy as saying.

The ambassador acknowledged that there was competition between the two sides and said China would not shy away from such competition as long as it was fair.

He rejected as unfair US claims that China’s lead in areas such as electric vehicles and solar panels was a result of overcapacity, and criticised the US insistence that other countries ban exports of certain products to China.

Blinken arrives in Beijing on Wednesday for three days of talks that are expected to cover the crises in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as bilateral ties.]]>

    <![CDATA[Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said Israel will increase "military pressure" on Palestinian militant group Hamas in a bid to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza.

"In the coming days we will increase the military and political pressure on Hamas because this is the only way to free our hostages," Netanyahu said in a video statement on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover, threatening to "deliver additional and painful blows" without specifying.

Despite an international outcry, Netanyahu has repeatedly said that the army will launch a ground assault on Rafah, a southern Gaza city so far spared an Israeli invasion where more than 1.5 million Palestinians have taken refuge.

The army has said some of the hostages abducted from southern Israel during Hamas's October 7 attack that sparked the war were being held in Rafah.

Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised statement later on Sunday that "the chief of staff has approved the next steps for the war," without offering details.

"On Passover, it will be 200 days of captivity for the hostages... We will fight until you return home to us." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[At least seven people were killed and another 21 wounded when a race car ploughed into spectators at a packed motorsport event hosted by Sri Lanka's army on Sunday, police said.

A driver crashed into the crowd on an unprotected stretch of the track at the Fox Hill circuit, which is maintained by the Sri Lankan army.

A video shared widely on social media showed track marshals waving yellow flags to warn other drivers to slow down after a car overturned on the track.

The drivers are seen speeding past in clouds of orange dust until a red car slams into the crowd, and people are heard screaming.

"A total of 27 people were taken to hospital and seven of them succumbed to their injuries," spokesman Nihal Thalduwa said, adding that an eight-year-old girl was among the dead.

Shortly before the crash, army chief Vikum Liyanage announced that the gates had been opened to spectators free of charge to promote motorsports, with the event being held for the first time in five years due to the Covid pandemic and the island's economic crisis.

"Today is a very special day... we decided to allow anyone to come in free," Liyanage said, claiming that about 100,000 spectators were at the Fox Hill circuit, around 180 kilometres east of Colombo. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Crowds gathered at Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach on Sunday for a candlelight memorial to the six people killed by a knife-wielding assailant at a nearby shopping mall.

Many hundreds sat on the grass in a beachside park to grieve for the five women and a Pakistani male security guard who died in the April 13 attack at the Westfield Bondi Junction shopping complex.

The killings stunned many Australians who are largely unaccustomed to such violent crime.

"When I heard this I cried. Because it is new to us. We don't have this happen often. It's a shock," said 56-year-old local cafe owner Daniela Pontidas.

"I know a lot of people that were impacted in some way," she said.

"I feel like this has burst Australia's bubble a bit."

Paul Inggall, 50, said he had been at Bondi Junction in the morning hours before the attack.

"These things don't happen often in Australia but when they do I think they have a profound impact," he said.

"I think it really moves the community, so I want to be a part of it."

The mentally ill knifeman, 40-year-old Joel Cauchi, was tracked down, shot and killed by police inspector Amy Scott, who attended the service.

As waves crashed into the beach at dusk, a choir sang the hymn "Keep Your Loving Arms Around Me."

An Indigenous didgeridoo was played as people lit candles in the breezy evening.

"Bondi is tough and this is a strong community, and we will get through this," said New South Wales Premier Chris Minns.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese offered the condolences of the nation for the six lives "snatched away on that hardest of Saturday afternoons."

"We mourn for all the joy they should have known," he said.

Cauchi's parents say he was diagnosed with schizophrenia at 17 but stopped taking medication, later leaving their Queensland home and dropping out of treatment.

His women victims were a designer, a volunteer surf lifesaver, the daughter of an entrepreneur, a Chinese university student, and a new mother.

The 38-year-old mother, Ashlee Good, handed over her bleeding nine-month-old girl Harriet to two strangers in desperation before being rushed to hospital where she died.

The baby was also taken to hospital and is said to be doing well.

The shopping mall reopened for business on Friday in a sombre mood, with floral tributes to the dead piled up inside and shoppers stopping to sign a book of condolence.

Australian leaders have praised the "heroes" of the Bondi attack, including the police and emergency responders.

The government has granted permanent citizenship to Frenchman Damien Guerot who fended off the attacker with a bollard; and it is expected to do the same for wounded Pakistani security guard Muhammad Taha.

Despite the rarity of such crimes, two days after the mall attack an Assyrian Christian bishop was brutally stabbed during a livestreamed service in western Sydney.

The bishop has said he is recovering in hospital. A 16-year-old suspect has been charged with committing "a terrorist act." (AFP)]]>

    Gaza officials say 50 bodies exhumed at hospital

    <![CDATA[Gaza's civil defence said on Sunday health workers had uncovered at least 50 bodies of people killed and buried by Israeli forces at a hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis.

Israel's military said it was checking the reports.

In a statement, the civil defence agency said the remains were discovered in the courtyard of the Nasser Medical Complex.

"Inside the Nasser Medical complex there are mass graves dug by the Israeli occupation ... we were shocked by the presence of bodies of 50 martyrs in one of the pits yesterday," Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for the civil defence agency, said.

"We are continuing the search operation today and are waiting for all graves to be exhumed in order to give a final number of martyrs."

He alleged some of those killed had been tortured.

"There were no clothes on some bodies, which certainly indicates (the victims) faced torture and abuse," Bassal said.

Intense fighting raged in mid-February in the area of the hospital, and Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles surrounded it on March 26.

In a separate statement on Sunday, Hamas condemned what it said was a "mass grave of those executed in cold blood and buried with military bulldozers in the hospital's courtyard."

It said more than 50 bodies had been recovered there.

Several of the bodies wrapped in white shrouds were later collected by relatives.

Hospitals in Gaza have not been spared in the Israeli assault, with the military accusing Hamas of using the facilities as command centres and to hold hostages abducted in the October 7 attack.

The World Health Organisation said on April 6 that the Palestinian territory's largest hospital, Al-Shifa in Gaza City, had been reduced to ashes by an Israeli siege last month, leaving an "empty shell" containing many bodies.

WHO staff who gained access to the devastated facility described horrifying scenes of bodies only partly buried, their limbs sticking out, and the stench of decomposition.

Israel is engaged in a sweeping military assault against Hamas militants in Gaza after they launched a attack on southern Israeli communities on October 7.

The unprecedented assault resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, Israelis and foreigners, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.

Some 250 people were abducted to Gaza during the attack, of whom 129 remain captive, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has so far killed 34,097 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[One person died and seven were missing on Sunday after an apparent accident overnight involving two Japanese military helicopters out to sea, officials said.

A spokesman for Japan's Self-Defense Force (SDF) confirmed the late Saturday incident and said that one person was rescued but later confirmed dead.

Defence Minister Minoru Kihara said rescuers "spotted what are believed to be part of the aircraft in the sea, and we believe that the two helicopters crashed."

"At this point the cause is unknown, but firstly we do our best to save lives," Kihara told reporters.

He said the helicopters were "doing drills to counter submarines at night".

Hours later, Kihara told reporters that the crew member who was rescued "was confirmed dead," according to the spokesman.

He also said the ministry retrieved flight recorders and was "analysing (the cause of the incident) including possibility of a collision between the two."

The helicopters appear to have crashed during night-time training off the Izu Islands in the Pacific Ocean, broadcaster NHK reported.

Communication with one chopper was lost at 10.38pm (1338 GMT) off the island of Torishima, and one minute later an emergency signal was received from this aircraft, NHK reported.

Around 25 minutes later, at around 11.04pm, the military realised that communication with the other aircraft was also lost in the same area.

The Mitsubishi SH-60K helicopters from the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) are mainly based on and operate from naval destroyers.

The MSDF said as there were no other aircraft nor vessels in nearby waters, involvement of another country in the incident is unlikely, NHK added. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Palestinian Red Crescent said on Saturday at least 14 people had been killed in an Israeli raid on Nur Shams refugee camp in the north of the occupied West Bank.

The Israeli army said troops had killed 10 militants during the operation, which it said started on Thursday.

AFP journalists saw bodies in the streets and houses hit by blasts as Israeli drones flew overhead and armoured vehicles moved through the camp.

Since early last year, violence has flared in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. It has escalated further since war broke out in Gaza on October 7.

"So far, our crews have evacuated 14 martyrs from Nur Shams camp to the hospital," the Palestinian Red Crescent said.

Earlier, the Palestinian health ministry said it had confirmed 11 injured in the Israeli raid, seven of them "wounded by live gunshots". Among them was a paramedic shot while trying to get to the wounded, it added.

Medics had been alerted to "a number of killed and injured" inside the camp, but the army was "denying them access to tend to the wounded", the ministry said.

An AFP journalist said paramedics had tried to enter the camp but had been refused access by the army. Gunshots rang out and soldiers carried out door-to-door raids, the journalist said.

Meanwhile, in Gaza, Palestinian emergency services said on Sunday that  they have uncovered a mass grave with 50 bodies at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.

The discovery comes after the Israeli military withdrew its troops from the southern city on April 7 - Much of the city is now in ruins after months of relentless Israeli bombardment and heavy fighting. (Agencies)]]>

    US House passes aid bills for Ukraine and Israel

    <![CDATA[Lawmakers in the US House of Representatives on Saturday quickly passed legislation to provide more aid to Ukraine and Israel. 

The bills, passed in a rare Saturday session, were approved by overwhelming bipartisan votes, though they leave the future of House speaker Mike Johnson in doubt as he seeks to fend off angry far-right detractors.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the long-delayed aid package, saying the military and economic assistance would "save thousands and thousands of lives."

The bills are the product of months of acrimonious negotiations, pressure from US allies and repeated pleas for assistance from Zelensky.

Spending bills cost the last Republican speaker of the House his job, and funding for Ukraine has been at the heart of the partisan squabbling.

The United States has been the chief military backer of Ukraine in its war against Russia, but Congress has not approved large-scale funding for its ally for nearly a year and a half, mainly because of the cross-aisle bickering.

President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers in Congress have been pushing for a major new weapons package for Ukraine for months.

But Republicans, influenced by the party's presidential candidate Donald Trump, have been reluctant to provide funding to Kyiv for the drawn-out conflict.

The financing of the war has become a point of contention ahead of a presidential election in November that is expected to pit Biden against Trump once again.

Johnson, after months of hesitation, finally threw his support behind the US$61 billion package for Ukraine that includes economic assistance and weapons.

"To put it bluntly, I'd rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys," Johnson said.

Writing on social media after the bill was passed, Ukraine's Zelensky expressed hope that the bill would soon clear the US Senate and be signed into law by Biden. "Thank you, America!" he added.

The bill also allows Biden to confiscate and sell Russian assets and provide the money to Ukraine to finance reconstruction, a move that has been embraced by other G7 nations.

The upper chamber could take the bill up as early as Tuesday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. (AFP)]]>

    S Korean doctors reject govt proposal to end strike

    <![CDATA[South Korea's leading doctors' body on Saturday rejected a revised medical reform plan from the government, the initial version of which sparked a strike two months ago.

The ongoing walkout by thousands of trainee doctors has caused chaos in South Korean hospitals, and is in response to a plan to boost annual admissions to medical schools by 2,000 from next year.

The government on Friday offered its first concession, allowing 32 universities to admit as few as 1,000 medical students instead of the initially proposed 2,000 – but the Korean Medical Association (KMA) said the plan must be abandoned entirely within a week.

"Since this is not a fundamental solution, the emergency committee of the Korean Medical Association clearly states that it cannot accept it," Kim Sung-geun, a KMA spokesperson, told reporters.

"For the sake of our country's future and to protect the health of patients currently suffering, we ask the president... to discuss this again from square one."

Kim said "one week is left" to find a solution.

The government claims its plan will alleviate doctor shortages for an ageing society, but medical professionals and trainees say it will diminish the quality of education and healthcare.

The strike, which began on February 20, has forced hospitals to cancel essential treatments and surgeries.

On top of the trainee doctors, who play a key role in emergency procedures and surgeries at general hospitals, more than 50 percent of the country's medical students have also filed for a leave of absence, according to the education ministry.

The KMA warned that if the government does not relent, medical students will likely be forced to repeat a year, senior doctors at general hospitals will start to resign on April 25, and the healthcare system could "collapse."

The government's Friday offer came after President Yoon Suk-yeol's conservative ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in parliamentary elections this month.

Initially, there was public sympathy for the government, but polls leading up to the April 10 election indicated that the mood had shifted.

Nearly 60 percent of people surveyed in a Dong-A Ilbo poll said the government should adjust the scale and timing of its reform plan.

The main opposition Democratic Party has also criticised Yoon and urged him to revise the reform plan.

The government had previously warned of legal consequences if doctors did not return to work, and suspended the medical licences of two KMA officials purportedly for instigating the walkout.

Proponents of the plan say opposing doctors are simply trying to safeguard their salaries and social status. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[At least 58 people going to a funeral died after their overloaded boat capsized in the Central African Republic's capital Bangui, the head of civil protection said on Saturday.

"We were able to extract 58 lifeless bodies. We don't know the total number of people who are underwater," Thomas Djimasse told Radio Guira.

According to witnesses and videos on social media, the boat was carrying more than 300 people – some standing and others perched on wooden structures – when it overturned on the Mpoko river on Friday.

The vessel was heading to the funeral of a village chief but capsized shortly after setting off, with rescuers arriving 40 minutes after the disaster.

Maurice Kapenya, who followed the boat in a canoe because there was no space on board, said he collected the bodies of some of the victims, including his own sister, with the help of fishermen and residents.

Families were seen near the river on Saturday looking for their loved ones who were still missing. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Tens of thousands of demonstrators hit the streets across Spain's Canary Islands on Saturday to demand changes to the model of mass tourism they say is overwhelming the Atlantic archipelago.

Rallying under the slogan "The Canary Islands have a limit", demonstrators began rallying at midday (1100 GMT), flag-waving crowds packing the streets of the main towns across all of the archipelago's seven islands.

Chanting and whistling, they waved scores of placards and banners emblazoned with slogans reading: "The Canary Islands are not up for sale!" or "A moratorium on tourism" while others simply said: "Respect my home."

Organisers say mass tourism perpetuates an economic model that harms local residents and are demanding the authorities limit the numbers.

Police said 20,000 demonstrators had turned out for the demonstrations, but organisers put the figure closer to 50,000, Spain's public television said.

"We are not against tourism," one woman demonstrator called Rosario Correo told Spain's TVE public television.

"We're asking that they change this model that allows for unlimited growth of tourism."

They are calling for a halt to the work on two new hotels on Tenerife, the largest and most developed of the archipelago's seven islands.

And they also want residents to be given a greater say in what they see as uncontrolled development which is harming the environment.

"The government and the islands' regional leaders must stop this corrupt model of never-ending growth which is based on the destruction of the environment and which only weakens the economy," said another demonstrator called Alfonso Boullon.

Protesters also gathered in Madrid and Barcelona to show their support for the rallies in the Canary Islands, public television said.

Anti-tourism protests have multiplied in recent months across Spain, the world's second-most visited country, prompting authorities to try to reconcile the interests of locals and a lucrative sector that accounts for 12.8 percent of Spain's economy.

The islands, which lie off the northwestern coast of Africa, are known for their volcanic landscapes and year-round sunshine attracting millions of visitors every year.

Some four out of 10 residents work in tourism which accounts for 36 percent of the islands' GDP, official figures show. (AFP)]]>

    Israeli strike kills 9 members of family in Rafah

    <![CDATA[Gaza's civil defence agency said on Saturday an overnight Israeli strike killed nine members of a Palestinian family including six children in the southern city of Rafah.

Five children aged one to seven and a 16-year-old girl were among the dead, along with two women and a man, according to the city's Al Najjar hospital.

"Nine martyrs including six children were pulled out from the rubble after Israeli air forces struck a house of the Radwan family in Tal al-Sultan in Rafah," Gaza Civil Defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said in a statement.

Outside the hospital witnesses saw people grieving over small body bags. A woman stroked a dead boy's forehead as planes rumbled overhead.

"People were sleeping peacefully," said neighbour Abu Mohammed Ziyadah.

"As you can see, there were no militants, not even male adults, except for the head of the family. They were all women and children."

Soon after the war in Gaza began on October 7, Israel told Palestinians living in the north of Gaza to move to "safe zones" in the territory's south such as Rafah.

But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has since vowed to invade the city, where around 1.5 million people – more than half the territory's population – are sheltering.

Israel has for two months threatened to send troops in against Hamas militants, but even without such an operation Rafah is under regular bombardment.

Bassal said the Israeli army struck several areas in Rafah overnight, including the Salam neighbourhood where one person was killed and several wounded. He said the army hit a house and a nursery school.

"It has been a very hard night on Rafah," he said. (AFP)]]>

    Taylor Swift, 'tortured poet', new album breaks record

    <![CDATA[Taylor Swift's hotly anticipated "The Tortured Poets Department" is here along with a surprise second album - 31 tracks released on Friday in which the megastar purges her inner turmoil while scorching former lovers.

The first album was released as scheduled at midnight (0400 GMT) but two hours later, an additional 15 tracks appeared - giving legions of Swifties plenty to chew on.

By Friday evening, platform Spotify declared the album its most-streamed in a single day, with Swift also becoming the most-streamed artist in a single day.

"I'd written so much tortured poetry in the past 2 years and wanted to share it all with you, so here's the second installment of TTPD: The Anthology. 15 extra songs. And now the story isn't mine anymore... it's all yours," she posted on social media in revealing the extra music.

Swift's album comes on the heels of a remarkably successful and busy year for the artist, whose "Midnights" won her a record-setting fourth Album of the Year Grammy.

She put on the first tour to break the $1 billion mark and is on track to make a second billion by the time it's over.

Swift also released two re-recordings of her earlier albums to resounding success, and broke box office records with an Eras Tour film.

But she also ended a six-year relationship with the British actor Joe Alwyn, after which she was linked to - and dramatically de-linked from - front man Matty Healy of the 1975.

Now she's dating NFL star Travis Kelce, whose Kansas City Chiefs just won the Super Bowl.

And all of the drama is immortalized in song.

When she announced "TTPD," Swift said it would be "an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time -- one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure."

"This period of the author's life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up." (AFP)]]>

    Man dies after setting self ablaze outside Trump trial

    <![CDATA[A man has died after setting himself on fire outside the New York courthouse where former US president Donald Trump’s hush-money trial was taking place.

Police identified the man as Max Azzarello, from Florida, who was rushed to hospital in critical condition after police on the scene tried to extinguish the fire.   

He was later pronounced dead by the hospital. 

It was not clear whether the self-immolation had anything to do with Trump's case, but the gruesome incident occurred on the street outside the building where the ex-president and current White House hopeful sat on the 15th floor.

The shocking development came shortly after jury selection for the trial was completed, clearing the way for prosecutors and defence attorneys to make opening statements on Monday in a case stemming from hush money paid to a porn star. The court adjourned later in the afternoon.

The 12 jurors, along with six alternates, will consider evidence in a first-ever trial to determine whether a former US president is guilty of breaking the law. Prosecutors intend to call at least 20 witnesses, according to Trump defence lawyer Susan Necheles.

Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of business fraud as part of a scheme to cover up hush money paid to a porn star so that the story would not come out just before the 2016 presidential election, in which he beat Hillary Clinton.

If convicted, he could face prison but would more likely be fined. (Agencies)

    WHO raises alarm after finding H5N1 in milk

    <![CDATA[The H5N1 bird flu virus strain has been detected in very high concentrations in raw milk from infected animals, the WHO said on Friday, though how long the virus can survive in milk is unknown.

Avian influenza A(H5N1) first emerged in 1996 but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, alongside an increase in the number of infected mammals.

The strain has led to the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, with wild birds and land and marine mammals also infected.

Cows and goats joined the list last month -- a surprising development for experts because they were not thought to be susceptible to this type of influenza.

US authorities earlier this month said a person working on a dairy farm in Texas was recovering from bird flu after being exposed to cattle.

"The case in Texas is the first case of a human infected by avian influenza by a cow," said Wenqing Zhang, head of the global influenza programme at the World Health Organization.

"Bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow and cow-to-bird transmission have also been registered during these current outbreaks, which suggest that the virus may have found other routes of transition than we previously understood," she told a media briefing in Geneva.

It was only the second case of a human testing positive for bird flu in the United States, and came after the virus sickened herds that were apparently exposed to wild birds.

"Now we see multiple herds of cows affected in an increasing number of US states, which shows a further step of the virus spillover to mammals," Zhang said.

"The virus has also been detected in milk from infected animals."

Zhang said there was a "very high virus concentration in raw milk", but experts were still investigating exactly how long the virus is able to survive in milk.

The Texas health department has said the cattle infections do not present a concern for the commercial milk supply, as dairies are required to destroy milk from sick cows. Pasteurisation also kills the virus.

"It is important for people to ensure safe food practices, including consuming only pasteurised milk and milk products," said Zhang.

From 2003 to April 1 this year, the WHO said it had recorded 463 deaths from 889 human cases across 23 countries, putting the case fatality rate at 52 percent.

Zhang noted that the human cases recorded in Europe and the United States in the past few years -- since the virus surged -- have been mild cases.

So far, there is no evidence that A(H5N1) is spreading between humans. (AFP)]]>

    Nato to help Ukraine beef up air defences

    <![CDATA[Nato countries have agreed to give Ukraine more air defences after desperate pleas from Kyiv for advanced systems to shoot down Russian attacks, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday.

"Nato defence ministers have agreed to step up and provide further military support, including more air defence," Stoltenberg said after virtual talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

"Nato has mapped out existing capabilities across the alliance and there are systems that can be made available to Ukraine," he said.

"So I expect new announcements on air defence capabilities for Ukraine soon."

Ukraine has been urgently calling on its Western backers to send more air defences as it has struggled to fend off a surge in Russian attacks on its infrastructure in recent weeks.

Kyiv has above all been calling for more US-designed Patriot systems that are capable of shooting down Russian hypersonic missiles.

Stoltenberg said there were Patriot and also Franco-Italian SAMP/T systems available in stocks of Nato countries that can be given to Ukraine.

But he could not say whether Nato defence ministers had made concrete commitments during the meeting.

Germany earlier this week announced it was giving Ukraine an additional Patriot system, on top of two already supplied.

Officials say that the United States, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Greece, Romania and Poland are the Nato countries with Patriot systems.

US lawmakers will vote on Saturday on a long-stalled US$61-billion aid package for Ukraine that allies hope will reopen support from Washington.

"I count on the bill to pass without further delay," Stoltenberg said.

The hold-up in support from Washington and struggles by Europe to find enough weaponry have left outgunned Ukrainian forces struggling to hold back Moscow's troops.

Stoltenberg said that ministers also discussed Kyiv's "many other pressing needs", including artillery shells, longer range missiles and drones.

"Each NATO ally will decide what to provide. Several allies made concrete commitments during the meeting and are finalising contributions that I expect will be announced soon," he said. (AFP)]]>

    'Israel retaliates, strikes central Iran'

    <![CDATA[Iran's state media reported explosions in the central province of Isfahan on Friday, as US media quoted officials saying Israel had carried out retaliatory strikes on its arch-rival.

Iranian media said no major damage was reported.

"Reports indicate there was no major damage or large explosions caused by the impact of any air threat," the official IRNA news agency said.

Air defence systems over several Iranian cities had been activated.

Israel had previously warned it would hit back after Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel over the weekend. Most of them were intercepted. It followed an April 1 strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that was widely blamed on Israel.

Iran's Fars news agency reported "three explosions" were heard near the Shekari army airbase in the northwest of Isfahan province, while Iran's space agency spokesman Hossein Dalirian said "several" drones had been "successfully shot down".

"There are no reports of a missile attack for now," Dalirian said on social media platform X.

Nuclear facilities in Isfahan were reported to be "completely secure", Iran's Tasnim news agency reported, citing "reliable sources".

ABC and CBS News reported the strikes had been carried out by Israel, quoting US officials. There was no immediate comment from the White House or Pentagon.

CNN quoted an official as saying the target of the Israeli attack was not nuclear.

The Israeli military told AFP: "We don't have a comment at this time."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has vowed to destroy Hamas over its October 7 attack that started the Gaza war, has stressed that Israel "reserves the right to protect itself" against Iran.

The United States, Israel's main ally and military supplier, has made clear it would not join a reprisal attack on Iran, but unveiled sanctions against people and entities involved in producing the drones deployed in the Iranian assault.

"We are holding Iran accountable," US President Joe Biden said on Thursday, announcing the measures after the European Union said it would also sanction Iran's drone programme.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian had warned that Tehran would make Israel "regret" any attack on the Islamic republic.

Flights were suspended across swathes of Iran on Friday.

"Iran's air defence has been activated in the skies of several provinces of the country," Tehran's official IRNA news agency said.

Mehr news agency reported that "flights to Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz, and airports in the west, northwest and southwest have been suspended."

Flight-tracking software showed commercial flights avoiding western Iran, including Isfahan, and skirting Tehran to the north and east.

On Thursday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres painted a dark picture of the situation in the Middle East, warning that spiralling tensions over the war in Gaza and Iran's attack on Israel could devolve into a "full-scale regional conflict."

"The Middle East is on a precipice. Recent days have seen a perilous escalation – in words and deeds," Guterres told the Security Council.

"One miscalculation, one miscommunication, one mistake, could lead to the unthinkable – a full-scale regional conflict that would be devastating for all involved," he said, calling on all parties to exercise "maximum restraint." (AFP)]]>

    Hindu nationalist Modi the favourite as India votes

    <![CDATA[India began voting on Friday in a six-week election with an all but assured victory for Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as a weakened opposition is pushed to the sidelines.

A total of 968 million people are eligible to take part in the world's biggest vote – a staggering logistical exercise that critics say follows a concerted effort to delegitimise rivals.

A long and winding queue was patiently assembled outside a polling station in the Hindu holy city of Haridwar, on the banks of the Ganges river, even before the booths opened.

"I am here because I am happy about the direction the country is headed," said autorickshaw driver Ganga Singh, 27. "I will vote keeping in mind not personal welfare but the country's prosperity."

Modi, 73, remains resoundingly popular after a decade in office that has seen India rise as an economic power.

"I urge all those voting... to exercise their franchise in record numbers," he wrote in a social media post on X as the election began. "Every vote counts and every voice matters!"

Modi has already led the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party through two landslide victories in 2014 and 2019, forged in large part by his appeals to the Hindu faithful.

His prospects have been further bolstered by several criminal probes into his opponents and a tax investigation this year that froze the bank accounts of Congress, India's largest opposition party.

Opposition figures and human rights organisations have accused Modi's government of orchestrating the probes to weaken rivals. (AFP)]]>
