    Spanish PM ponders future as wife faces probe

    <![CDATA[Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he will suspend public duties until next week to decide whether he wants to continue leading the government after a court launched a business corruption probe into his wife's private dealings.

Sanchez, who last year secured another term for his Socialist party as leader of a minority coalition government, said he would appear before the media on Monday, April 29 to announce his decision.

"I need to pause and think," he wrote in a letter shared on his X account. "I urgently need an answer to the question of whether it is worthwhile (...) whether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honour."

The shock announcement came after a Spanish court said earlier on Wednesday it was launching a preliminary investigation into whether Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez committed a crime of influence peddling and corruption in business in her private dealings.

Sanchez said the seriousness of the attacks against him and his wife merited a measured response. He said his wife would cooperate with the investigation and defend her innocence.

The court investigating Gomez did not provide further details as the case is sealed and preliminary, only saying it followed a complaint raised by anti-graft campaign group Manos Limpias – Clean Hands – whose leader has links to the far-right.

Manos Limpias said Gomez used her influence as the wife of the prime minister to allegedly secure sponsors for a university master's degree course that she ran.

Sanchez also took aim at opposition leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo of the People's Party and Santiago Abascal of the far-right Vox party, saying they had "collaborated" with those circulating the claims against his wife.

His ministers came out in support, with Energy Minister Teresa Ribera saying: "We have a first rate prime minister. Neither he nor his family deserve this." (Reuters)]]>

    HK buyer snaps up 'lost' Klimt for US$32mn

    <![CDATA[Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of Miss Lieser", a painting of a young woman left unfinished when the Austrian artist died, was bought by a Hong Kong buyer at auction on Wednesday for 30 million euros (US$32 million) despite open questions about its subject and previous ownership.

The work was long thought to have been lost when in fact it was hanging in a private villa near Vienna for decades, according to the auction house Im Kinsky that put it on display in January before putting it under the hammer. Im Kinsky had estimated its value at 30 million to 50 million euros.

The auction house confirmed the buyer was in Hong Kong and was represented by Patti Wong & Associates, but did not identify the buyer. The AFP news agency said the painting was sold to the SAR's HomeArt gallery.

It shows its likely teenage subject in a turquoise dress draped in a flowing floral gown against a red background, her alabaster skin and piercing, pale brown eyes contrasting with her dark, curly hair.

Despite depicting her so clearly, it remains unclear who "Fraeulein Lieser" actually was. The brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were wealthy industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire, having built their wealth on jute and hemp, making twine and rope.

Henriette Amalie Lieser-Landau, nicknamed "Lilly", was married to Justus until their divorce in 1905 and became a well-known patron of the arts. It is possible she commissioned the painting of one of her daughters, or Adolf Lieser could have done so with his daughter Margarethe as the subject.

"According to the latest provenance research, Klimt's model was possibly not Margarethe Constance Lieser, Lilly Lieser's niece, but one of her two daughters (with Justus), either Helene, the older one, born in 1898, or her sister Annie, who was three years younger," the auction house said on its website.

What happened to the painting after Klimt's death in 1918, when it would have been in his studio, remains unclear, particularly what happened after Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938 and the country's Jews were persecuted, expropriated and sent to concentration camps.

"It was these many ambiguities and historical gaps that prompted the current owners to contact the legal successors of the Lieser family and to agree on a 'fair and just solution' with them all in 2023," Im Kinsky said, without identifying the current owners.

"It has been agreed not to disclose the contents of the said agreement; however, it can be stated that all conceivable claims of all parties involved will be settled and fulfilled through the auctioning of the artwork," it said. (Reuters/AFP)

    First Ukraine aid to arrive in hours: Biden

    <![CDATA[US President Joe Biden signed a hard-fought bill into law on Wednesday that provides billions of dollars of new US aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia, notching a rare bipartisan victory for the president as he seeks reelection and ending months of wrangling with Republicans in Congress.

"It gives vital support to America's partners so they can defend themselves from threats to their sovereignty," Biden said.

The bill includes US$61 billion in aid to Ukraine and US$26 billion for Israel, as well as $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Gaza.

The impact of the legislation was immediate. Biden said he had approved an initial US$1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.

The initial aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defence munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.

Biden, a Democrat who is expected to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the November election, had pressed lawmakers for six months to approve more funding for Ukraine. Trump objected to the Ukraine aid, and some Republicans in Congress refused to back it, questioning whether Ukraine could ever prevail.

Biden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation and vowed to return soon to addressing border security, a top issue for Republicans.

“This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together despite our differences," he said.

Biden blamed "MAGA Republicans" loyal to Trump for spending months blocking the aid, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.

He said passage of the legislation sends a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military has been making gains in Ukraine.

"He's failed again. American stands with our friends. ... We bow to no one, no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin," he said. (Reuters)]]>

    Boeing reports Q1 loss amid ongoing crisis

    <![CDATA[Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.

The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.

The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.

Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.

Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.

Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)]]>

    Bill to ban TikTok in US clears Congress

    <![CDATA[The US Senate voted late on Tuesday by a wide margin to send legislation to President Joe Biden that would require Chinese owner ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations within about nine months or face a ban.

The measure was passed by the US House of Representatives on Saturday and Biden said he would sign it into law on Wednesday.

TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing, has argued the law amounts to a ban that would violate the US free speech rights of its users.

The company did not immediately comment but over the weekend, it told its employees that it would quickly go to court to try to block the legislation.

"We'll continue to fight, as this legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok... This is the beginning, not the end of this long process," TikTok told employees on Saturday.

The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favour of the bill.

In 2020, then-President Donald Trump was blocked by the courts in his bid to block TikTok and WeChat in the United States.

The new legislation, however, is likely to give the Biden administration stronger legal footing to ban TikTok if ByteDance fails to divest the app, experts say. It also gives the White House new tools to ban or force the sale of other foreign-owned apps it deems to be security threats. 

China has described the proposed US ban on TikTok as unfair.

The Foreign Ministry said last month there is "no fairness to speak of" in citing national security to reduce the competitive advantage of other countries. (Reuters)]]>

    Trump jury gets master class on burying negative press

    <![CDATA[A colourful former tabloid publisher took the witness stand on Tuesday at Donald Trump's "hush money" trial and described how he suppressed negative stories about the real estate tycoon, a practice known as "catch and kill."

Trump, 77, the first former US president to face criminal charges, is accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels over a 2006 sexual encounter that could have damaged his 2016 presidential bid.

Prosecutors allege that Trump engaged in "election fraud" by having his then personal lawyer Michael Cohen make a US$130,000 payment to the adult film actress on the eve of the 2016 election in which he defeated Hillary Clinton.

David Pecker, 72, former publisher of the National Enquirer, was the first witness called to testify by prosecutors at Trump's high-stakes trial, which comes less than seven months ahead of his expected rematch against President Joe Biden.

Prosecutors are seeking with Pecker's testimony to demonstrate that the "catch and kill" scheme of squashing negative stories was one commonly used by Trump and Cohen, the once loyal "fixer" who has since turned against his former boss.

Pecker took the stand after a nearly 90-minute hearing during which Judge Juan Merchan was asked by prosecutors to hold Trump in contempt of court for violating a partial gag order preventing him from publicly attacking witnesses, jurors or court staff.

Merchan heard arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys but did not issue an immediate ruling.

Pecker said he has known Trump since 1989 and described him as a friend – "I would call him Donald."

He said National Enquirer readers "loved" Trump, who starred in the hit reality television series "The Apprentice" before going into politics in 2015.

Pecker said he agreed at an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower with Trump, Cohen and Trump's personal assistant Hope Hicks to help his friend's nascent campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

"I said what I would do is, I would run or publish positive stories about Mr Trump and I would publish negative stories about his opponents."

Pecker said he would also warn Cohen about potential negative stories about Trump.

"When I notified Michael Cohen of a story that was a negative story, he would try to vet it himself, see if the story was true or not," Pecker said. "And he would go to the individual publication to make sure the story wasn't published and get it killed."

Prosecutors walked Pecker through two payments made to squash negative stories. One involved a Trump Tower doorman who was peddling a false claim that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.

The other involved a former Playboy magazine model, Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with the married Trump. She was paid US$150,000 not to go public with the story.

Pecker is to return to the witness stand when the trial resumes on Thursday.

Before Pecker testified, prosecutors – at a hearing held without the jury present – accused Trump of brazenly violating the gag order imposed by the judge.

Trump's "willful" attacks on witnesses "clearly violate" the gag order, prosecutor Chris Conroy said, urging the judge to fine him US$1,000 per violation.

"We are not yet seeking an incarceratory penalty," Conroy said, but the court should "remind him that incarceration is an option should it be necessary."

Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and Cohen are both expected to appear as prosecution witnesses at the trial.

Trump has repeatedly attacked them on Truth Social, calling them, for example, "sleaze bags who have, with their lies and misrepresentations, cost our country dearly."

Trump lashed out at the judge following the day's proceedings, calling the gag order "unconstitutional."

"I'm not allowed to talk but people are allowed to talk about me," he said. "They can lie but I'm not allowed to say anything."

He complained that Biden is "out campaigning and I'm here in the courtroom."

"It's a very unfair situation." (AFP)]]>

    UN calls for probe into deaths at Gaza hospitals

    <![CDATA[The United Nations called on Tuesday for an international investigation into reports of mass graves at two Gaza hospitals destroyed in Israeli sieges, saying war crimes might have been committed.

The UN rights office said it was "horrified" by the destruction of Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa in Gaza City, and its second largest, the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.

Gaza's Civil Defence agency said on Tuesday that health workers had uncovered nearly 340 bodies, updating an earlier figure, of Palestinians allegedly killed and buried by Israeli forces at the Nasser complex.

Israel's army dismissed claims that its troops had buried bodies during its operation at Nasser as "baseless and unfounded."

The UN rights office demanded "independent, effective and transparent investigations into the deaths."

"Given the prevailing climate of impunity, this should include international investigators," UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.

Hospitals, which are protected under international law, have repeatedly come under Israeli bombardment over more than six months of war in Gaza.

Israel has accused Palestinian militant group Hamas of using medical facilities as command centres and to hold hostages abducted during its attack inside Israel on October 7.

Hamas has denied the claims.

"Hospitals are entitled to very special protection under international humanitarian law," Turk said. "And the intentional killing of civilians, detainees and others who are hors de combat is a war crime."

The UN rights office said it did not have access to independent information as to what happened at the two hospitals.

But spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said efforts were under way to corroborate reports and details given by Gazan authorities.

"Victims had reportedly been buried deep in the ground and covered with waste," she told reporters in Geneva, adding that older people, women and wounded were reportedly among the dead.

Others were allegedly "found with their hands tied and stripped of their clothes." (AFP)]]>

    Migrant detentions set to begin under UK-Rwanda plan

    <![CDATA[The UK readied on Tuesday to start detaining migrants within days for deportation to Rwanda after the controversial plan got parliament's approval, sparking outrage from the UN and rights groups.

The new legislation – a flagship policy of the Conservative government that aims to curb irregular cross-Channel migration from northern France – cleared its final hurdle after a marathon late-night parliamentary tussle on Monday.

Just hours later French police said at least five migrants, including a child, died overnight during an attempt to cross the busy shipping lane in a small boat.

Under the UK scheme, undocumented asylum seekers arriving in Britain would be sent to Rwanda, where their asylum claims would be examined and, if approved, would allow them to stay in Rwanda.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says deportations are expected to begin within 10-12 weeks, with migrants identified for the first flight due to be detained and held from as early as this week.

Rwanda said it was "pleased" to see the bill passed and was looking forward to "welcoming those relocated to Rwanda."

But the heads of the UN agencies for refugees and human rights warned it threatened the rule of law and set "a perilous precedent globally."

They urged the UK to instead "take practical measures to address irregular flows of refugees and migrants, based on international cooperation and respect for international human rights law."

The Council of Europe also called for the new law to be scrapped and said it raised "major issues about the human rights of asylum seekers and the rule of law more generally." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[At least five people have died while attempting to cross the English Channel, according to French authorities, hours after Britain approved its migrant deportation bill.

The regional Voix du Nord newspaper said the bodies were discovered at the Wimereaux beach in northern France on Tuesday. 

Local officials said about 110 migrants were crowded onto a small boat when panic broke out.

Neither local authorities nor the coast guard could say how many people had been rescued or could be missing.

The coast guard was still carrying out search-and-rescue operations at sea, a spokesperson said, after what the official called a "busy" morning, with several crossing attempts.

Reports of the deaths came only hours after British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s latest effort to send some migrants on a one-way ticket to Rwanda finally won approval from Parliament. 

The UK government plans to deport some of those who enter the country illegally as a deterrent to migrants who risk their lives in hopes they will be able to claim asylum once they reach Britain.

Human rights groups have described the legislation as inhumane and cruel. 

Both the United Nations refugee agency and the Council of Europe called on Britain to rethink its plans for fears they could damage international cooperation on tackling the global migrant crisis. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[Two Malaysian navy helicopters collided in mid-air during a rehearsal on Tuesday for a naval parade, killing all 10 crew members aboard, the country's navy said in a statement.

Naval officials said the incident occurred at the Lumut base in the western state of Perak on Tuesday morning.

"All victims were confirmed dead at the scene and sent to the Lumut base military hospital for identification," a spokesperson said.

A video circulating on local media showed several helicopters flying in formation, when one of the choppers' rotor clipped another before both aircraft crashed into the ground.

The navy said it would carry out an investigation.

Malaysian Defence Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin said the aircraft - a maritime operations helicopter and a Fennec military chopper - were rehearsing for a parade celebrating the 90th anniversary of the Royal Malaysian Navy, due to be held on Saturday. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[An Australian court has ordered X to hide some posts commenting on the stabbing of a bishop in Sydney, deepening a war of words between the social media platform's owner Elon Musk and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

Australia's federal court late on Monday granted the country's cyber regulator, the eSafety commissioner, a two-day injunction requiring the social media platform to hide some posts on a knife attack last week against an Assyrian church bishop, Mar Mari Emmanuel, during a service at his church.

Albanese on Tuesday hit out at Musk, calling him an "arrogant billionaire" for pushing back against the Australian government's calls to take down the content.

X had blocked the content for its users in Australia but said it would not block the posts for users outside the country, arguing that the government had no authority to dictate content its users can see globally.

Videos of the attack posted online showed the attacker, restrained by the congregation, shouting at the bishop for insulting Islam. Police have charged a 16-year-old with a terrorism offence over the attack.

The regulator had asked X to remove certain posts that publicly commented on the attack, which could include videos.

Judge Geoffrey Kennett, in an after-hours hearing, ordered X to block access to the posts until Wednesday afternoon, court documents showed. The matter will be considered again on Wednesday.

Albanese said social media must have social responsibility but Musk was fighting to keep violent content on his platform.

"We'll do what's necessary to take on this arrogant billionaire who thinks he's above the law, but also above common decency," Albanese told national broadcaster ABC on Tuesday. "What the eSafety Commissioner is doing, is doing her job to protect the interests of Australians."

Musk had earlier called the eSafety commissioner the "Australian censorship commissar", drawing rebuke from Albanese who described X's fight against removing violent content as "extraordinary".

"I'd like to take a moment to thank the PM for informing the public that this platform is the only truthful one," Musk said in a post on X hours before Albanese's comments on Tuesday. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Nasa's Voyager 1 probe – the most distant man-made object in the universe – is returning usable information to ground control following months of spouting gibberish, the US space agency announced on Monday.

The spaceship stopped sending readable data back to Earth on November 14, 2023, even though controllers could tell it was still receiving their commands.

In March, teams working at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory discovered that a single malfunctioning chip was to blame, and devised a clever coding fix that worked within the tight memory constraints of its 46-year-old computer system.

"Voyager 1 spacecraft is returning usable data about the health and status of its onboard engineering systems," the agency said.

"The next step is to enable the spacecraft to begin returning science data again."

Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 was mankind's first spacecraft to enter the interstellar medium, in 2012, and is currently more than 15 billion miles from Earth. Messages sent from Earth take about 22.5 hours to reach the spacecraft.

Its twin, Voyager 2, also left the solar system in 2018.

Both Voyager spacecraft carry "Golden Records" – 12-inch, gold-plated copper discs intended to convey the story of our world to extraterrestrials.

These include a map of our solar system, a piece of uranium that serves as a radioactive clock allowing recipients to date the spaceship's launch, and symbolic instructions that convey how to play the record.

The contents of the record, selected for Nasa by a committee chaired by legendary astronomer Carl Sagan, include encoded images of life on Earth, as well as music and sounds that can be played using an included stylus.

Their power banks are expected to be depleted sometime after 2025. They will then continue to wander the Milky Way, potentially for eternity, in silence. (AFP)]]>

    India's Modi accused of targeting Muslims in speech

    <![CDATA[India's main opposition Congress party filed a complaint to the Election Commission on Monday accusing Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi of "blatantly targeting" minority Muslims in a campaign speech.

The world's most populous country is constitutionally secular and its election code bans canvassing based on "communal feelings."

Modi's muscular Hindu-first politics is a key part of his electoral appeal and his opponents accuse him of marginalising India's 200 million Muslim population.

The prime minister usually steers away from explicit references to religion – the word "Hindu" does not appear in his Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) 76-page election manifesto.

But at a weekend election rally in Rajasthan, Modi claimed a previous Congress government had said that "Muslims have the first right over the nation's wealth."

He said if Congress won "it will be distributed among those who have more children. It will be distributed to the infiltrators."

"Do you think your hard-earned money should be given to infiltrators? Would you accept this?"

Critics said the phrases were references to Muslims.

In its complaint to the Election Commission, the Congress party said the "divisive, objectionable and malicious" comments were targeted at "a particular religious community" and amounted to "blatant and direct violations of electoral laws."

They were "far worse than any ever made by a sitting Prime Minister in the history of India," the complaint said.

Congress party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi told reporters outside the Commission's office: "We hope concrete action will be taken."

Modi and the BJP are widely expected to coast to victory in India's marathon elections, which began last Friday and with the results due on June 4.

Earlier this year, Modi presided over the inauguration of a grand temple to the deity Ram, built on the site of a centuries-old mosque razed by Hindu zealots.

The BJP has frequently invoked the temple on the campaign trail.

BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia told reporters on Monday that Modi was calling "a spade a spade" and his remarks resonated with what people thought. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Israeli military said on Monday the chief of its intelligence directorate has resigned after taking responsibility for failures leading to the unprecedented October 7 attack by Hamas.

Major General Aharon Haliva is the first high-ranking official to step down for failing to prevent the attack that shocked Israel and the international community.

"Major General Aharon Haliva, in coordination with the chief of the general staff, has requested to end his position, following his leadership responsibility as the head of the intelligence directorate for the events of October 7," the military said in a statement.

"It was decided that MG Aharon Haliva will end his position and retire from the IDF (army), once his successor is appointed in an orderly and professional process."

In his resignation letter, Haliva, who served in the force for 38 years, took responsibility for failing to prevent the attack.

"On Saturday, October 7th 2023, Hamas committed a deadly surprise attack against the state of Israel," he wrote in the letter, a copy of which was given to journalists by the military.

"The intelligence division under my command did not live up to the task we were entrusted with.

"I carry that black day with me ever since. Day after day, night after night. I will forever carry with me the terrible pain of the war."

In his letter, Haliva called for a "thorough investigation into factors and circumstances" that led to the attack.

The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.

Since then, Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas and is engaged in a blistering assault against the militant group which rules the Gaza Strip.

The Palestinian territory's health ministry said 34,097 people have been killed in Israel's military campaign in Gaza, most of them women and children. (AFP)]]>

    Trump in NY court for start of criminal trial

    <![CDATA[Former US president Donald Trump arrived in court on Monday for opening statements in his criminal trial and condemned the high-stakes case as a "witch hunt" designed to derail his White House bid.

"It's a very, very sad day in America," the 77-year-old Republican presidential candidate told reporters before entering the Manhattan courtroom.

"I'm here instead of being able to be in Pennsylvania, in Georgia, and lots of other places campaigning," he said. "This is a witch hunt and it's a shame and it comes out of Washington."

Trump is the first former president to face criminal charges and the case poses substantial risks to him less than seven months before his election rematch with President Joe Biden.

Prosecution witnesses are expected to include adult film actress Stormy Daniels – who says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, a claim he denies – and Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen.

The identities of the jury's five women and seven men are being kept secret for their own protection.

Security was tight on Monday after a man set himself on fire last week outside the courthouse in an unrelated but gruesome incident.

Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to pay US$130,000 in "hush money" to Daniels to ensure an account of their alleged tryst did not get out ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

The alleged crime is less significant than the indictments stemming from Trump's attack on the 2020 election – which the Republican lost to Democrat Biden – and his hoarding of secret documents.

Trump could face jail time in the current case, although a fine or probation is more likely, analysts say. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[South Korean military on Monday said North Korea fired an unidentified ballistic missile into the sea off South Korea's east coast, the latest in an apparent volley of tests by Pyongyang this year.

"North Korea has fired an unidentified missile into the East Sea," South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.

Tokyo also confirmed the launch, with the Japanese defence ministry saying "a suspected ballistic missile was launched from North Korea" in a post on X, formerly Twitter.

Japanese media reported the suspected missile fell outside Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone.

Seoul-based specialist site NK News said the "brief flight time, likely under 10 minutes, pointed to the launch involving a short-range ballistic missile or a multiple launch rocket system."

The latest launch comes after UN sanctions monitoring against the nuclear-armed nation was upended last month by Russia. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape says his nation does not deserve to be labelled cannibals, and urged the US to clear up the remnants of the Second World War littered across the Pacific, after comments by President Joe Biden about his missing serviceman uncle.

Biden had "appeared to imply his uncle was eaten by cannibals after his plane was shot down over PNG during WWII", Marape's office said in a statement late on Sunday.

"President Biden's remarks may have been a slip of the tongue; however, my country does not deserve to be labelled as such," Marape said in the statement.

"I urge President Biden to get the White House to look into cleaning up these remains of WWII so the truth about missing servicemen like Ambrose Finnegan can be put to rest."

Biden has previously cited his personal connection with Papua New Guinea's wartime history on visits to Australia, telling the story of his uncle who died in a plane crash in May 1944.

Biden last week raised the possibility his uncle might have fallen victim to cannibals, after visiting a missing-in-action war memorial in Pennsylvania.

Historians say Papua New Guinea was crucial to the United States drive across the Pacific to liberate the Philippines in the Second World War, while Australia has said the wartime history showed the renewed strategic importance of its northern neighbour.

The impact of the war remains sensitive among Pacific Islanders, however. Marape said his nation was "needlessly dragged into a conflict that was not their doing".

Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands remain littered with wartime human remains, plane wrecks, ship wrecks and tunnels, as well as leftover bombs which were still killing people, he said. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[China's ambassador to the United States said on Saturday that the two countries need to keep working to improve relations amid "unprecedented challenges".

Xie Feng made the comments at Harvard University ahead of a visit to Beijing this week by the top US diplomat, Antony Blinken.

“Whether the younger generation can continue to enjoy the eight-decade-long peace and development as their parents did depends largely on whether China and the United States can find the right way to get along in the new era,” Xie said in comments released by the embassy on Sunday.

Xie said talks in California between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, in November had injected stability into the bilateral relationship and also formed a forward-looking “San Francisco vision”. 

“Since the meeting, the two sides have maintained interactions at various levels, and conducted dialogue and cooperation in areas including foreign policy, economy and trade, law enforcement, agriculture, and [military to military] relations,” Xie was quoted by the embassy as saying.

The ambassador acknowledged that there was competition between the two sides and said China would not shy away from such competition as long as it was fair.

He rejected as unfair US claims that China’s lead in areas such as electric vehicles and solar panels was a result of overcapacity, and criticised the US insistence that other countries ban exports of certain products to China.

Blinken arrives in Beijing on Wednesday for three days of talks that are expected to cover the crises in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as bilateral ties.]]>

    <![CDATA[Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said Israel will increase "military pressure" on Palestinian militant group Hamas in a bid to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza.

"In the coming days we will increase the military and political pressure on Hamas because this is the only way to free our hostages," Netanyahu said in a video statement on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover, threatening to "deliver additional and painful blows" without specifying.

Despite an international outcry, Netanyahu has repeatedly said that the army will launch a ground assault on Rafah, a southern Gaza city so far spared an Israeli invasion where more than 1.5 million Palestinians have taken refuge.

The army has said some of the hostages abducted from southern Israel during Hamas's October 7 attack that sparked the war were being held in Rafah.

Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised statement later on Sunday that "the chief of staff has approved the next steps for the war," without offering details.

"On Passover, it will be 200 days of captivity for the hostages... We will fight until you return home to us." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[At least seven people were killed and another 21 wounded when a race car ploughed into spectators at a packed motorsport event hosted by Sri Lanka's army on Sunday, police said.

A driver crashed into the crowd on an unprotected stretch of the track at the Fox Hill circuit, which is maintained by the Sri Lankan army.

A video shared widely on social media showed track marshals waving yellow flags to warn other drivers to slow down after a car overturned on the track.

The drivers are seen speeding past in clouds of orange dust until a red car slams into the crowd, and people are heard screaming.

"A total of 27 people were taken to hospital and seven of them succumbed to their injuries," spokesman Nihal Thalduwa said, adding that an eight-year-old girl was among the dead.

Shortly before the crash, army chief Vikum Liyanage announced that the gates had been opened to spectators free of charge to promote motorsports, with the event being held for the first time in five years due to the Covid pandemic and the island's economic crisis.

"Today is a very special day... we decided to allow anyone to come in free," Liyanage said, claiming that about 100,000 spectators were at the Fox Hill circuit, around 180 kilometres east of Colombo. (AFP)]]>
