    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping said there was reason for optimism in the development of China-US relations as he met America's top diplomat in Beijing on Friday.

According to state media, the president told Antony Blinken that progress had been made over the past few months in stabilising ties between the two countries.

Xi said the two nations should be "partners, not rivals", and should seek common ground while reserving differences and avoid descending into vicious competition, adding: "there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved, and there is still room for further efforts."

The president also said that "China would be pleased to see a confident and open, prosperous and developing United States".

"We hope the US can also take a positive view of China's development," he added.

"When this fundamental problem is solved... relations can truly stabilise, get better, and move forward." (Reuters/AFP)]]>

    ByteDance says 'no plans' to sell TikTok

    <![CDATA[Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok after a new US law put it on a deadline to divest from the hugely popular video platform or have it banned in the United States.

Tech publication, The Information, earlier reported that ByteDance is exploring scenarios for selling TikTok's US business without the algorithm that recommends videos to TikTok users. ByteDance denied it was considering a sale.

"Foreign media reports about ByteDance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue," the company posted on Thursday on Toutiao, a Chinese-language platform it owns.

"ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok."

TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew said on Wednesday the social media company expects to win a legal challenge to block legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden that he said would ban its popular short video app used by 170 million Americans.

The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the US Senate on Tuesday, is driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or use the app for surveillance.

Biden's signing sets a January 19 deadline for a sale – one day before his term is poised to expire – but he could extend the deadline by three months if he determines privately owned ByteDance is making progress. (AFP/Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Millions of Indians began voting Friday in the second round of multi-phase national elections as polarisation grows over Prime Minister Narendra Modi whipping up an assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics in his campaign.

Voting opened at 7am in the country. 

But turnout in the first round of voting last week dropped nearly four points to 66 percent from the last election in 2019, with speculation in Indian media that higher-than-average temperatures were to blame.

The second round of the poll -- conducted in phases to ease the immense logistical burden of staging an election in the world's most populous country -- includes districts that have this week seen temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius.

The outcome of Friday’s voting across 88 constituencies in 13 states with 160 million voters will be crucial for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.

Most polls predict a win for Modi and the BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.

Nearly 970 million voters will elect 543 members from a total 28 states to the lower house of Parliament for five years during the staggered election that runs until June 1. 

The votes will be counted on June 4. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Thursday inspected the test-firing of 240 mm multiple-launch rockets manufactured by a newly-established defence industry unit, the North's KCNA news agency reported on Friday.

The report did not give further details of the unit that produced the artillery. North Korea is believed to be ramping up production of artillery amid allegations by the United States and South Korea that it is supplying Russia with weapons.

Both countries deny the allegation.

The test firing showed the rockets met the required standards for flight characteristics and accuracy, KCNA said.

Kim said the 240 mm multiple launch rocket system, which incorporates new technology, will "bring about a strategic change in strengthening our military's artillery capabilities," according to KCNA.

In a separate report, KCNA said Kim visited the Kim Il Sung Military University, named after his grandfather and state founder, to mark the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary army, the precursor to the country's military. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigned on Thursday and a transitional council took power with the aim of returning stability to a country where gang violence has caused chaos and misery.

Henry's former finance minister, Michel Patrick Boisvert, will be interim prime minister.

"Today is an important day in the life of our dear republic, this day in effect opens a view to a solution... to the multidimensional crises the country faces," Boisvert said after the formal swearing-in of the nine-person transitional council on Thursday morning.

Top police and military officials and members of the transitional council stood behind Boisvert during the ceremony, hosted at the prime minister's office known as Villa d'Accueil, which was surrounded by military and a security detail.

Henry announced last month he would resign once the council was in place.

He left Haiti in February to seek international help for police in their battles with armed and powerful gangs. But he was left stranded outside the country as the gangs threatened to completely take over the capital. Struggling to return, Henry announced his intended resignation. Boisvert had served as acting prime minister in Henry's absence.

The transitional government's mandate runs until February 2026, by when there are slated to be elections, and cannot be renewed.

But the path to getting to elections was long, and there were already tensions within the council as different factions jostled for power, said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.

"Despite the installation, there is still a long and rocky road ahead for the council to be able to forge a government," Da Rin said.

The naming of the council is also seen as key step towards the deployment of a multinational security mission. Kenya had offered to head that mission but then put it on pause as the security situation deteriorated, saying it would re-evaluate once a new government was in place.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the multinational force to happen quickly to help tackle the "dire" situation, his spokesperson said on Thursday. (Reuters)]]>

    Climate change wipes 10pc off wine production

    <![CDATA[World wine production dropped 10 percent last year, the biggest fall in more than six decades, because of "extreme" climate changes, the body that monitors the trade said Thursday.

"Extreme environmental conditions" including droughts, fires and other problems with climate were mostly to blame for the drastic fall, said the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) that covers nearly 50 wine producing countries.

Australia and Italy suffered the worst, with 26 and 23 percent drops. Spain lost more than a fifth of its production. Harvests in Chile and South Africa were down by more than 10 percent.

The OIV said the global grape harvest was the worst since 1961, and worse even than its early estimates in November.

In further bad news for winemakers, customers drank three per cent less wine in 2023, the French-based intergovernmental body said.

Director John Barker highlighted "drought, extreme heat and fires, as well as heavy rain causing flooding and fungal diseases across major northern and southern hemisphere wine producing regions."

Although he said climate problems were not solely to blame for the drastic fall, "the most important challenge that the sector faces is climate change.

"We know that the grapevine, as a long-lived plant cultivated in often vulnerable areas, is strongly affected by climate change," he added.

France bucked the falling harvest trend, with a four percent rise, making it by far the world's biggest wine producer.

Wine consumption last year was however at its lowest level since 1996, confirming a fall-off over the last five years, according to the figures.

The trend is partly due to price rises caused by inflation and a sharp fall in wine drinking in China – down a quarter.]]>

    US top court ponders 'rule for the ages' in Trump case

    <![CDATA[The US Supreme Court heard arguments on Thursday on whether a former president is immune from criminal prosecution and appeared poised to issue a ruling that could further delay Donald Trump's trial on charges of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.

The historic case -- the last in the court's current term – has far-reaching implications for executive power and Trump's multiple legal issues as he seeks the White House again.

"We're writing a rule for the ages," said Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of three conservative justices appointed to the nation's highest court by the former Republican president.

At least four, and possibly five, of the conservative justices on the nine-member court appeared to take issue with a lower court ruling that a former president does not enjoy "absolute immunity" from criminal prosecution after leaving office.

Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, told Michael Dreeben, representing Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the election conspiracy charges against Trump, that he had "concerns" with the lower court ruling.

"As I read it, it says simply, 'a former president can be prosecuted because he's being prosecuted,'" Roberts said.

"Why shouldn't we either send (the case) back to the Court of Appeals or issue an opinion making clear that that's not the law?"

Sending the case back to the lower court for further review would almost certainly delay Trump's election conspiracy trial until after the November vote, when he is expected to face off once again against Democrat Joe Biden.

Justice Samuel Alito, another conservative, asked why – without immunity – a president won't just "pardon themselves from anything that they might have been conceivably charged with committing?"

John Sauer, representing Trump, told the court that "without presidential immunity from criminal prosecution there can be no presidency as we know it."

"Every current president will face de facto blackmail and extortion by his political rivals while he is still in office," Sauer said. (AFP)]]>

    Former partners to seek to oust Scots leader

    <![CDATA[The Scottish Green Party will vote against Scotland's Humza Yousaf in a vote of no confidence in him as first minister, a source within the party said on Thursday.

Yousaf's other opponents said earlier on Thursday they would seek to oust him as Scotland's leader after his Scottish National Party abandoned a coalition with the Greens.

Yousaf, who serves as first minister in Scotland's devolved government, ended the alliance on Thursday. The arrangement had come under strain after a decision to scrap a climate change emissions reduction target last week. 

The SNP has led Scotland's devolved government since 2011, but its fortunes faltered since a funding scandal and the resignation of a party leader last year.

The party holds broadly centre-left views, but its coalition with the Greens had highlighted splits over how progressive its pitch should be as it seeks to woo back voters on social and environmental issues beyond its core call for independence.

Earlier this month, a YouGov poll put the main British opposition Labour Party slightly ahead of the SNP in Scotland for the first time since Scottish voters chose to remain part of the United Kingdom in an independence referendum in 2014. (Reuters)]]>

    NY court overturns Weinstein rape conviction

    <![CDATA[Harvey Weinstein's 2020 conviction for sexual assault and rape was overturned by New York's highest court, reopening the landmark case that launched the #MeToo movement and highlighting the challenges of holding powerful men accountable.

In a bitterly divided 4-3 decision on Thursday, the state Court of Appeals said the trial judge made a critical mistake by letting women testify that Weinstein assaulted them, even though their accusations were not part of the charges he faced.

The court said the trial judge compounded the error by letting Weinstein be cross-examined on a broad range of "loathsome" conduct, including bullying and fits of anger toward associates, that portrayed him in a "highly prejudicial" light.

"It is an abuse of judicial discretion to permit untested allegations of nothing more than bad behaviour that destroys a defendant's character but sheds no light on their credibility as related to the criminal charges," Judge Jenny Rivera wrote for the majority.

"The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial," she added.

Weinstein, 72, has been serving a 23-year sentence in a prison in upstate Rome, New York.

He is not expected to be freed immediately, as he also faces a separate 16-year prison term in California after being convicted there last year for the 2013 rape of an actress at a Los Angeles hotel.

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose predecessor Cyrus Vance brought the New York case, will decide whether to retry Weinstein.

"We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault," Emily Tuttle, a spokesperson for Bragg, said in an email. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[The blades of the windmill on top of the Moulin Rouge cabaret, one of the most famous landmarks in Paris, collapsed during the night, firefighters on Thursday said, just months before the French capital hosts the Olympics.

The letters M, O and U had also been toppled from the name spelled out on the building's facade.

While the reason for the accident was not yet known, the Moulin Rouge's director Jean-Victor Clerico said there was no sign of "foul play", adding the cause was "obviously a technical problem".

No-one was hurt and there was no risk of further collapse, Paris firefighters said.

Moulin Rouge is best known as the birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance. The club was founded in 1889 and the audience for its dance shows is largely made up of tourist groups.

Hundreds of thousands of people watch the cabaret's daily shows each year, with many more stopping to look from the outside at the landmark at the foot of the Montmartre hill. (Agencies)]]>

    House Speaker heckled as protests spread on campuses

    <![CDATA[Columbia University students heckled US House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday as he visited the flashpoint of nationwide student demonstrations over the Israeli war in Gaza, even as the New York school agreed to 48 more hours of negotiations to end a protest encampment.

Johnson's visit, which he said was meant to support Jewish students intimidated by some anti-Israeli demonstrators, took place shortly after the university extended a deadline from Wednesday morning to Friday morning to reach an agreement to remove an encampment that has come to symbolise the campus protest movement.

Some of the campus protests taking place coast to coast were met with shows of force from law enforcement.

In Texas on Wednesday, state highway patrol troopers in riot gear and police on horseback broke up a protest at the University of Texas in Austin and arrested 20 people.

The University of Southern California declared its campus closed and asked the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) to clear a demonstration. 

Police arrested students who peacefully surrendered one-by-one, hours after campus police who took down an encampment were overwhelmed by protesters and requested LAPD help.

Other demonstrations took place at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and California State Polytechnic in Humboldt.

Protesting students have demanded universities divest assets from Israel and seek to pressure the US government to rein in Israeli strikes on Palestinian civilians.

Israel's fierce response followed a deadly October 7 cross-border raid by Islamist militants from Hamas, which controls the Gaza enclave.

The at times vulgar heckling and booing that greeted Johnson did not drown him out, though he was hard to hear because he spoke to media microphones, not through loudspeakers.

"As Columbia has allowed these lawless radicals and agitators to take over, the virus of anti-semitism has spread across other campuses," Johnson said from the steps of the university library, calling on violent protesters to be arrested and threatening to cut off federal funding to universities that fail impose order.

In a politically polarised country, conservatives can score points by being seen as standing up to liberal activists, many of whom say the Republican portrayals of anti-semitic violence on campus are greatly exaggerated for political purposes.

Johnson also met with Jewish students who said they were fearful to come onto the campus, citing testimony from Jewish students who said they had been spat on and seen swastikas drawn on the walls.

Before his press conference, Johnson met with about 40 Jewish students on campus, according to students who were there.

Students at the encampment say their protest has been peaceful, and that outsiders not connected with their movement are behind any inflammatory confrontations off-campus.

"We regret that there's no attention on this peaceful movement and politicians are diverting attention from the real issues," said Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student at Columbia who has been part of the negotiations with school administration.

Free speech advocates PEN America called the sudden escalation at the University of Texas "deeply alarming."

"The administration should be doing everything in their power to keep their students safe and the campus operating, but calling the state police to disperse a peaceful protest that had barely begun does the opposite," Kristen Shahverdian, PEN's campus free speech program director, said in a statement.

The political reverberations reached the White House, where press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden believes free speech, debate and non-discrimination are important on college campuses.

"We want to see this be peaceful," Jean-Pierre said in Wednesday's press briefing. "It is important that students feel safe... It should not be violent, it should not be hateful rhetoric." (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he will suspend public duties until next week to decide whether he wants to continue leading the government after a court launched a business corruption probe into his wife's private dealings.

Sanchez, who last year secured another term for his Socialist party as leader of a minority coalition government, said he would appear before the media on Monday, April 29 to announce his decision.

"I need to pause and think," he wrote in a letter shared on his X account. "I urgently need an answer to the question of whether it is worthwhile (...) whether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honour."

The shock announcement came after a Spanish court said earlier on Wednesday it was launching a preliminary investigation into whether Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez committed a crime of influence peddling and corruption in business in her private dealings.

Sanchez said the seriousness of the attacks against him and his wife merited a measured response. He said his wife would cooperate with the investigation and defend her innocence.

The court investigating Gomez did not provide further details as the case is sealed and preliminary, only saying it followed a complaint raised by anti-graft campaign group Manos Limpias – Clean Hands – whose leader has links to the far-right.

Manos Limpias said Gomez used her influence as the wife of the prime minister to allegedly secure sponsors for a university master's degree course that she ran.

Sanchez also took aim at opposition leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo of the People's Party and Santiago Abascal of the far-right Vox party, saying they had "collaborated" with those circulating the claims against his wife.

His ministers came out in support, with Energy Minister Teresa Ribera saying: "We have a first rate prime minister. Neither he nor his family deserve this." (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of Miss Lieser", a painting of a young woman left unfinished when the Austrian artist died, was bought by a Hong Kong buyer at auction on Wednesday for 30 million euros (US$32 million) despite open questions about its subject and previous ownership.

The work was long thought to have been lost when in fact it was hanging in a private villa near Vienna for decades, according to the auction house Im Kinsky that put it on display in January before putting it under the hammer. Im Kinsky had estimated its value at 30 million to 50 million euros.

The auction house confirmed the buyer was in Hong Kong and was represented by Patti Wong & Associates, but did not identify the buyer. The AFP news agency said the painting was sold to the SAR's HomeArt gallery.

It shows its likely teenage subject in a turquoise dress draped in a flowing floral gown against a red background, her alabaster skin and piercing, pale brown eyes contrasting with her dark, curly hair.

Despite depicting her so clearly, it remains unclear who "Fraeulein Lieser" actually was. The brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were wealthy industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire, having built their wealth on jute and hemp, making twine and rope.

Henriette Amalie Lieser-Landau, nicknamed "Lilly", was married to Justus until their divorce in 1905 and became a well-known patron of the arts. It is possible she commissioned the painting of one of her daughters, or Adolf Lieser could have done so with his daughter Margarethe as the subject.

"According to the latest provenance research, Klimt's model was possibly not Margarethe Constance Lieser, Lilly Lieser's niece, but one of her two daughters (with Justus), either Helene, the older one, born in 1898, or her sister Annie, who was three years younger," the auction house said on its website.

What happened to the painting after Klimt's death in 1918, when it would have been in his studio, remains unclear, particularly what happened after Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938 and the country's Jews were persecuted, expropriated and sent to concentration camps.

"It was these many ambiguities and historical gaps that prompted the current owners to contact the legal successors of the Lieser family and to agree on a 'fair and just solution' with them all in 2023," Im Kinsky said, without identifying the current owners.

"It has been agreed not to disclose the contents of the said agreement; however, it can be stated that all conceivable claims of all parties involved will be settled and fulfilled through the auctioning of the artwork," it said. (Reuters/AFP)

    <![CDATA[US President Joe Biden signed a hard-fought bill into law on Wednesday that provides billions of dollars of new US aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia, notching a rare bipartisan victory for the president as he seeks reelection and ending months of wrangling with Republicans in Congress.

"It gives vital support to America's partners so they can defend themselves from threats to their sovereignty," Biden said.

The bill includes US$61 billion in aid to Ukraine and US$26 billion for Israel, as well as US$1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Gaza.

The impact of the legislation was immediate. Biden said he had approved an initial US$1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.

The initial aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defence munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.

Biden, a Democrat who is expected to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the November election, had pressed lawmakers for six months to approve more funding for Ukraine. Trump objected to the Ukraine aid, and some Republicans in Congress refused to back it, questioning whether Ukraine could ever prevail.

Biden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation and vowed to return soon to addressing border security, a top issue for Republicans.

“This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together despite our differences," he said.

Biden blamed "MAGA Republicans" loyal to Trump for spending months blocking the aid, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.

He said passage of the legislation sends a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military has been making gains in Ukraine.

"He's failed again. American stands with our friends. ... We bow to no one, no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin," he said. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.

The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.

The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.

Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.

Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.

Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)]]>

    Bill to ban TikTok in US clears Congress

    <![CDATA[The US Senate voted late on Tuesday by a wide margin to send legislation to President Joe Biden that would require Chinese owner ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations within about nine months or face a ban.

The measure was passed by the US House of Representatives on Saturday and Biden said he would sign it into law on Wednesday.

TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing, has argued the law amounts to a ban that would violate the US free speech rights of its users.

The company did not immediately comment but over the weekend, it told its employees that it would quickly go to court to try to block the legislation.

"We'll continue to fight, as this legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok... This is the beginning, not the end of this long process," TikTok told employees on Saturday.

The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favour of the bill.

In 2020, then-President Donald Trump was blocked by the courts in his bid to block TikTok and WeChat in the United States.

The new legislation, however, is likely to give the Biden administration stronger legal footing to ban TikTok if ByteDance fails to divest the app, experts say. It also gives the White House new tools to ban or force the sale of other foreign-owned apps it deems to be security threats. 

China has described the proposed US ban on TikTok as unfair.

The Foreign Ministry said last month there is "no fairness to speak of" in citing national security to reduce the competitive advantage of other countries. (Reuters)]]>

    Trump jury gets master class on burying negative press

    <![CDATA[A colourful former tabloid publisher took the witness stand on Tuesday at Donald Trump's "hush money" trial and described how he suppressed negative stories about the real estate tycoon, a practice known as "catch and kill."

Trump, 77, the first former US president to face criminal charges, is accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels over a 2006 sexual encounter that could have damaged his 2016 presidential bid.

Prosecutors allege that Trump engaged in "election fraud" by having his then personal lawyer Michael Cohen make a US$130,000 payment to the adult film actress on the eve of the 2016 election in which he defeated Hillary Clinton.

David Pecker, 72, former publisher of the National Enquirer, was the first witness called to testify by prosecutors at Trump's high-stakes trial, which comes less than seven months ahead of his expected rematch against President Joe Biden.

Prosecutors are seeking with Pecker's testimony to demonstrate that the "catch and kill" scheme of squashing negative stories was one commonly used by Trump and Cohen, the once loyal "fixer" who has since turned against his former boss.

Pecker took the stand after a nearly 90-minute hearing during which Judge Juan Merchan was asked by prosecutors to hold Trump in contempt of court for violating a partial gag order preventing him from publicly attacking witnesses, jurors or court staff.

Merchan heard arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys but did not issue an immediate ruling.

Pecker said he has known Trump since 1989 and described him as a friend – "I would call him Donald."

He said National Enquirer readers "loved" Trump, who starred in the hit reality television series "The Apprentice" before going into politics in 2015.

Pecker said he agreed at an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower with Trump, Cohen and Trump's personal assistant Hope Hicks to help his friend's nascent campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

"I said what I would do is, I would run or publish positive stories about Mr Trump and I would publish negative stories about his opponents."

Pecker said he would also warn Cohen about potential negative stories about Trump.

"When I notified Michael Cohen of a story that was a negative story, he would try to vet it himself, see if the story was true or not," Pecker said. "And he would go to the individual publication to make sure the story wasn't published and get it killed."

Prosecutors walked Pecker through two payments made to squash negative stories. One involved a Trump Tower doorman who was peddling a false claim that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.

The other involved a former Playboy magazine model, Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with the married Trump. She was paid US$150,000 not to go public with the story.

Pecker is to return to the witness stand when the trial resumes on Thursday.

Before Pecker testified, prosecutors – at a hearing held without the jury present – accused Trump of brazenly violating the gag order imposed by the judge.

Trump's "willful" attacks on witnesses "clearly violate" the gag order, prosecutor Chris Conroy said, urging the judge to fine him US$1,000 per violation.

"We are not yet seeking an incarceratory penalty," Conroy said, but the court should "remind him that incarceration is an option should it be necessary."

Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and Cohen are both expected to appear as prosecution witnesses at the trial.

Trump has repeatedly attacked them on Truth Social, calling them, for example, "sleaze bags who have, with their lies and misrepresentations, cost our country dearly."

Trump lashed out at the judge following the day's proceedings, calling the gag order "unconstitutional."

"I'm not allowed to talk but people are allowed to talk about me," he said. "They can lie but I'm not allowed to say anything."

He complained that Biden is "out campaigning and I'm here in the courtroom."

"It's a very unfair situation." (AFP)]]>

    UN calls for probe into deaths at Gaza hospitals

    <![CDATA[The United Nations called on Tuesday for an international investigation into reports of mass graves at two Gaza hospitals destroyed in Israeli sieges, saying war crimes might have been committed.

The UN rights office said it was "horrified" by the destruction of Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa in Gaza City, and its second largest, the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.

Gaza's Civil Defence agency said on Tuesday that health workers had uncovered nearly 340 bodies, updating an earlier figure, of Palestinians allegedly killed and buried by Israeli forces at the Nasser complex.

Israel's army dismissed claims that its troops had buried bodies during its operation at Nasser as "baseless and unfounded."

The UN rights office demanded "independent, effective and transparent investigations into the deaths."

"Given the prevailing climate of impunity, this should include international investigators," UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.

Hospitals, which are protected under international law, have repeatedly come under Israeli bombardment over more than six months of war in Gaza.

Israel has accused Palestinian militant group Hamas of using medical facilities as command centres and to hold hostages abducted during its attack inside Israel on October 7.

Hamas has denied the claims.

"Hospitals are entitled to very special protection under international humanitarian law," Turk said. "And the intentional killing of civilians, detainees and others who are hors de combat is a war crime."

The UN rights office said it did not have access to independent information as to what happened at the two hospitals.

But spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said efforts were under way to corroborate reports and details given by Gazan authorities.

"Victims had reportedly been buried deep in the ground and covered with waste," she told reporters in Geneva, adding that older people, women and wounded were reportedly among the dead.

Others were allegedly "found with their hands tied and stripped of their clothes." (AFP)]]>

    Migrant detentions set to begin under UK-Rwanda plan

    <![CDATA[The UK readied on Tuesday to start detaining migrants within days for deportation to Rwanda after the controversial plan got parliament's approval, sparking outrage from the UN and rights groups.

The new legislation – a flagship policy of the Conservative government that aims to curb irregular cross-Channel migration from northern France – cleared its final hurdle after a marathon late-night parliamentary tussle on Monday.

Just hours later French police said at least five migrants, including a child, died overnight during an attempt to cross the busy shipping lane in a small boat.

Under the UK scheme, undocumented asylum seekers arriving in Britain would be sent to Rwanda, where their asylum claims would be examined and, if approved, would allow them to stay in Rwanda.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says deportations are expected to begin within 10-12 weeks, with migrants identified for the first flight due to be detained and held from as early as this week.

Rwanda said it was "pleased" to see the bill passed and was looking forward to "welcoming those relocated to Rwanda."

But the heads of the UN agencies for refugees and human rights warned it threatened the rule of law and set "a perilous precedent globally."

They urged the UK to instead "take practical measures to address irregular flows of refugees and migrants, based on international cooperation and respect for international human rights law."

The Council of Europe also called for the new law to be scrapped and said it raised "major issues about the human rights of asylum seekers and the rule of law more generally." (AFP)]]>

    At least five die trying to cross English Channel

    <![CDATA[At least five people have died while attempting to cross the English Channel, according to French authorities, hours after Britain approved its migrant deportation bill.

The regional Voix du Nord newspaper said the bodies were discovered at the Wimereaux beach in northern France on Tuesday. 

Local officials said about 110 migrants were crowded onto a small boat when panic broke out.

Neither local authorities nor the coast guard could say how many people had been rescued or could be missing.

The coast guard was still carrying out search-and-rescue operations at sea, a spokesperson said, after what the official called a "busy" morning, with several crossing attempts.

Reports of the deaths came only hours after British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s latest effort to send some migrants on a one-way ticket to Rwanda finally won approval from Parliament. 

The UK government plans to deport some of those who enter the country illegally as a deterrent to migrants who risk their lives in hopes they will be able to claim asylum once they reach Britain.

Human rights groups have described the legislation as inhumane and cruel. 

Both the United Nations refugee agency and the Council of Europe called on Britain to rethink its plans for fears they could damage international cooperation on tackling the global migrant crisis. (Agencies)]]>
