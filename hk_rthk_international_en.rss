    <![CDATA[Legendary Japanese animators Studio Ghibli will receive an honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May, organisers announced on Wednesday.

The Oscar-winning studio, co-founded by Hayao Miyazaki 40 years ago, is beloved worldwide for its masterpieces like "Spirited Away", "My Neighbour Totoro" and "Howl's Moving Castle".

It will mark the first that that Cannes gives an award to a collective, rather than an individual.

Miyazaki makes few public appearances and his long-time collaborator Isao Takahata died in 2018.

The other founder, producer Toshio Suzuki, said he was "truly honoured and delighted" to be receiving the award.

Ghibli's "characters populate our imaginations with prolific, colourful universes and sensitive, engaging narrations," said the Cannes organisers in a statement.

"With Ghibli, Japanese animation stands as one of the great adventures of cinephilia, between tradition and modernity," they added.

Miyazaki, 83, has announced his retirement more than once, but was back in cinemas last year with "The Boy and the Heron", which won the Oscar for best animated film last month, his second after "Spirited Away" in 2003.

It was already announced that another huge figure in cinematic storytelling, George Lucas, creator of "Star Wars", would also receive an honorary Palme at this year's festival, which runs from May 14 to 25. (AFP)]]>

    Boeing safety in spotlight before US Senate

    <![CDATA[Boeing's safety culture and manufacturing quality, both at the centre of a full-blown crisis following a January mid-air panel blowout, faced scrutiny on Wednesday in two US Senate hearings.

Boeing has been grappling with a safety crisis after the door plug panel blew off an Alaska Airlines flight that took off from Portland, Oregon, on January 5. The planemaker has undergone a management shakeup, US regulators have put curbs on its production, and deliveries fell by half in March.

Testimony at the US Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations raised questions about missing records surrounding the panel, along with production concerns over two separate Boeing widebody jets.

Former Boeing engineer Ed Pierson said he turned over records, sent to him from an internal whistleblower, to the FBI that he said provided information about the plug.

Boeing has said it believed that required documents detailing the removal of the door plug were never created. Boeing directed questions to the National Transportation Safety Board, which was not immediately available for comment.

The FBI declined to comment.

Whistleblower Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer who raised questions about two of the planemaker's widebody jets, claimed he was told to "shut up" when he flagged safety concerns. He has said that he was removed from the 787 programme and transferred to the 777 jet due to his questions.

Salehpour has claimed Boeing failed to adequately shim, or use a thin piece of material to fill tiny gaps in a manufactured product, an omission that could cause premature fatigue failure over time in some areas of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Salehpour said he had reached out to Boeing official Lisa Fahl but was not provided specific safety data.

Fahl has said the 787, which was launched in 2004, had a specification of five-thousandths of an inch gap allowance within a five-inch area, or "the thickness of a human hair."

"When you are operating at 35,000 feet," the size of a human hair can be a matter of life and death, Salehpour told the hearing. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[A volcano erupted several times in Indonesia's outermost region Wednesday, with authorities raising the alert level to its highest point after the dome spewed a column of smoke more than a mile into the sky and forced hundreds to evacuate.

Mount Ruang, a stratovolcano in North Sulawesi Province, first erupted at 9.45 pm on Tuesday and four times throughout Wednesday, the country's volcanology agency said.

The alert level for the volcano, which has a peak of 725 metres above sea level, was then raised on Wednesday evening from three to four, the highest possible level in the four-tiered system.

"Based on the result of visual and instrumental observation that showed an increase in volcanic activity, Mount Ruang's level was raised from Level 3 to Level 4," Hendra Gunawan, head of Indonesia's volcanology agency said in a statement late on Wednesday.

Authorities also widened a four-kilometre exclusion zone to six kilometres on Wednesday evening around the crater.

There were no reports of deaths or injuries, but more than 800 people were evacuated from two Ruang Island villages to nearby Tagulandang Island, which is located more than 100 kilometres north of provincial capital Manado, state agency Antara reported.

The volcanology agency said residents of Tagulandang must be evacuated outside the six-kilometre radius by Wednesday evening.

Gunawan also warned local residents to "be on alert for the potential ejection of rocks, hot cloud discharges and tsunami caused by the collapse of the volcano's body into the sea," the statement said.

Ruang's initial eruption late Tuesday pushed an ash column two kilometres into the sky, with the second eruption pushing it to 2.5 kilometres, Muhammad Wafid, head of the geological agency said in a statement earlier Wednesday.

The volcanology agency said Tuesday that volcanic activity had increased at Ruang after two earthquakes in recent weeks. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Police in Canada and the United States have arrested six people and are seeking three others in connection with the theft of over C$22 million (US$16 million) in gold and cash from an Air Canada cargo facility last year.

In what authorities described as the largest gold heist in Canadian history, suspects including an Air Canada employee forged an airway bill to steal the cargo that had arrived in Toronto from Zurich in April 2023.

The cargo contained 6,600 gold bars weighing 400 kilograms, worth over C$20 million, and C$2.5 million in foreign currency, the Peel regional police told reporters at a briefing.

The suspects have been hit with more than 19 charges by the authorities, who recovered one kilogram of gold and approximately C$434,000 in Canadian currency, police said.

The stolen gold may have been melted and reconstituted, making it difficult to track down, police said.

Police also recovered some 65 firearms that investigators allege were purchased from the proceeds of the theft.

"We believe that they've melted down the gold and then the profits they got from the gold, they use to help finance the firearms," Detective Sergeant Mike Mavity said.

Five suspects were arrested in Canada and conditionally released. One suspect, originally from Brampton, Ontario, was arrested in Pennsylvania along with the firearms and remains in custody in the United States. Canada-wide warrants have been issued for the remaining three suspects, police said.

Following the heist, Miami-based transport and security services provider Brinks sued Air Canada in October, alleging "negligence and carelessness" by the airline.

Brinks had been hired by Swiss bank Raiffeisen Schweiz and precious metals refining company Valcambi to move the valuables from Switzerland to Canada. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Three Russian missiles slammed into the city centre of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine on Wednesday, killing at least 17 people, wounding dozens more and damaging civilian buildings, officials said.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Kyiv's allies to rush in air defence support after the city, which had a pre-war population of 300,000, became the latest target of an intensifying Russian air strike campaign.

"This would not have happened if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence equipment and if the world's determination to counter Russian terror had been sufficient," Zelenskiy wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

Videos showed flames and columns of black smoke rising over Chernihiv, which is about 150 km from the capital Kyiv and about 80 km from the Russian border.

Three explosions ripped through a busy central area of the city just after 9am local time, destroying a hotel, officials said.

The strike also damaged several multi-storey residential buildings, a hospital, an education facility and dozens of private cars, officials said.

"Unfortunately, Russia continues to engage in terrorist activity against civilians and civilian infrastructure as confirmed by this strike on Chernihiv once again," acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako said on national television.

Sixty people, including three children, were wounded, the emergency services said.

Russia, which denies targeting civilians, attacked with three Iskander cruise missiles, governor Vyacheslav Chaus told the Suspilne public broadcaster. (Reuters)]]>

    Snake on a train delays Japanese bullet service

    <![CDATA[Even small delays in Japan's much-vaunted bullet trains are rare, and more unusual still are snakes on board holding up the speedy "shinkansen" services.

On Tuesday evening, a passenger alerted security to a 40-centimetre serpent lurking on a train between Nagoya and Tokyo, resulting in a 17-minute hold-up.

It was unclear whether the cold-blooded commuter was venomous or how it ended up on the train, and there was no injury or panic among passengers, a spokesman for Central Japan Railway Company said.

Shinkansen customers can bring small dogs, cats and other animals, including pigeons on board – but not snakes.

"It's difficult to imagine wild snakes somehow climbing onto the train at one of the stations. We have rules against bringing snakes into the shinkansen," the spokesman said.

"But we don't check passengers' baggage," he added.

The train was originally scheduled to go on to Osaka, but the company decided to use a different train for the trip, causing a delay of about 17 minutes, he said.

Patrols by uniformed security guards onboard bullet trains were scaled up after a fatal stabbing in 2018 on a shinkansen that shocked normally ultra-safe Japan.

Additional security was added for the Olympics in 2021 and Group of Seven meetings last year. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Dubai's major international airport began diverting all incoming flights on Tuesday as heavy rains lashed the city, causing widespread flooding.

The world's busiest air hub for international passengers, which had been expecting more than 100 flights on Tuesday evening, earlier briefly halted its operations in the chaos caused by the storm.

Dubai, the Middle East's financial centre, has been paralysed by the torrential rain that caused floods around the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and left 18 dead in Oman on Sunday and Monday.

"Due to the continued exceptional weather event currently being experienced in the UAE, Dubai International is temporarily diverting inbound flights due to arrive this evening... until the inclement situation improves," a Dubai Airports spokesperson said.

Departures will continue, said the spokesperson, who earlier warned that roads around the airport have suffered major flooding and urged passengers to use public transport.

Airport operations were earlier suspended for 25 minutes before resuming. Unconfirmed images on social media showed planes taxiing across an apron flooded with standing water.

Similar scenes were repeated across Dubai and elsewhere in the UAE as the desert country, better known for its arid climate and intense summer heat, reeled from the storm.

Flagship shopping centres Dubai Mall and Mall of the Emirates both suffered flooding and water was ankle-deep in at least one Dubai Metro station, according to images posted on social media.

Roads and residential communities also suffered heavy flooding and many residents reported leaks from roofs, doors and windows. (AFP)]]>

    Trump trial 'not about his presidency', jurors told

    <![CDATA[Donald Trump's criminal trial on charges stemming from hush money paid to a porn star is not a referendum on his presidency, a prosecutor told prospective jurors on Tuesday in asking whether they could put personal politics aside.

"This case is really not about whether you like Donald Trump. This case is about the rule of law and whether Donald Trump broke it," Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass told the 18 prospective jurors who remained of an initial pool of 96.

Jury selection for the former US president's trial got under way on Monday. He faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. Daniels says she had a sexual encounter with Trump about a decade beforehand.

Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies an encounter took place. The Republican presidential candidate has called the case, brought by Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a partisan witch hunt meant to interfere with his campaign to unseat President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 5 election.

The hush money case is one of four criminal indictments he faces, which stem from alleged mishandling classified information and trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden. He has pleaded not guilty in those cases, which may not go to trial before the election.

The proceedings so far have underscored the challenges of choosing a jury of 12 residents of heavily Democratic Manhattan who can try the case fairly and impartially.

Roughly half of 96 potential jurors summoned on Monday were dismissed after saying they could not impartially judge the polarising businessman-turned-politician.

Six more were excused on Tuesday. They said they had scheduling conflicts, concerns about balancing juror service with their jobs, or had thought further overnight and come to the conclusion they could not be fair.

The jurors allowed to stay on for now after answering questions on Tuesday included an asset manager at Lazard who is originally from Mexico and enjoys scuba diving and skiing, and a corporate lawyer from Oregon who hikes and runs in his spare time and reads the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Trump, wearing a blue tie, at times held a piece of paper up to his face as jurors read out answers to a list of 42 questions. Occasionally he yawned and leaned back in his chair at the defence table. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[A fire ripped through Copenhagen's Old Stock Exchange, one of the Danish capital's most famous landmarks, on Tuesday, engulfing its spire which collapsed in a scene reminiscent of the 2019 blaze at Paris' Notre-Dame Cathedral.

Emergency services, employees from the Danish Chamber of Commerce, including its CEO Brian Mikkelsen, and even passers-by were seen carrying large paintings away from the building in a race to save historic artefacts from the flames.

A video showed the flaming spire breaking in half as it tumbled down, sending a large part crashing to the ground next to a fire truck.

"Everybody is crying at the Danish Chamber of Commerce right now. It's their workplace, but also their history," Mikkelsen told reporters, shaking his head in disbelief.

"It's our cultural heritage that I'm looking at. It's 400 years that have shaped Danish cultural history and the society we live in today."

Denmark's National Museum sent 25 employees to the scene to help evacuate cultural artefacts and paintings, it said on X.

Video from local media showed people sitting on the ground outside the building, looking through paper catalogues listing and depicting the artefacts inside.

"We are saving everything we possibly can," Copenhagen fire department chief Jakob Vedsted Andersen told reporters.

Among the works saved were paintings by Denmark's Peder Severin Kroyer, a renowned 19th century impressionist.

Rescued items would be sent to Denmark's National Museum for examination, its head of collection storage and curation Camilla Jul Bastholm told Reuters.

The historic building, whose spire was shaped as the tails of four dragons intertwined, had been under renovation and clad in scaffolding when the fire broke out.

Parts of the roof had collapsed and the fire spread to several floors of the building, the fire service said, adding the firefighting operation would continue through the night.

There were no reports of injuries, police said, and it was not immediately clear what caused the blaze. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[South Korea on Tuesday marked the 10th anniversary of the country's worst maritime disaster, when hundreds of schoolchildren died after the overloaded Sewol ferry capsized and sank.

The disaster and botched rescue efforts dealt a crushing blow to then-president Park Geun-hye, who was eventually impeached in 2017, and the tragedy remains divisive and politically sensitive in South Korea even now.

A Coast Guard vessel took some of the victims' families to the site of the sinking early Tuesday for a special ceremony.

At the site off South Korea's south coast -- marked by a yellow buoy -- the families called out the names of the deceased and threw flowers into the water, followed by a moment of silence.

People say: 'It's been 10 years, bury it (in your memory)'" Park Jeong-hwa, whose daughter Cho Eun-jung was among the 304 people killed in the tragedy, said ahead of the anniversary.

"I thought I was going to be able to do it, thinking maybe after 10 years, the pain would fade a bit. But instead, it's even more painful now."

President Yoon Suk-yeol, whose party was dealt a crushing defeat in parliamentary elections last week, offered his condolences to the families of victims at a Tuesday cabinet meeting.

"Even though 10 years have passed, the events of April 16, 2014, remain vivid in my memory," he said. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Donald Trump's New York criminal trial opened on Monday in a historic first for a US ex-president – and a seismic twist to an already explosive 2024 election where the Republican is seeking to defy multiple scandals and return to power.

Trump has repeatedly described the hush money case as a sham.

But reality set in for the 77-year-old, hard-right Republican as Judge Juan Merchan issued the routine warning for criminal defendants that he will have to attend proceedings in the gritty Manhattan courthouse daily – or face arrest.

Merchan also warned Trump against repeating his frequent past attempts to disrupt hearings with incendiary social media posts and courtroom outbursts.

The judge scheduled a hearing next week to consider whether Trump should already be held in contempt for violating a partial gag order restricting him from attacking individuals connected to the case.

Selection of 12 jurors – given anonymity to protect them from what the judge says is risk of bribery or even physical harm – is expected to be a tortuous process.

Of the first batch of 96 prospective panelists sworn in, at least 50 were quickly excused after they said they could not be fair and impartial in a case involving one of the most famous – and controversial – men in the world.

Nine others were allowed to leave after stating there were compelling reasons they could not serve, while remaining prospective jurors were grilled about their education, hobbies and news consumption.

The process, which will resume Tuesday at 1330 GMT, could go on as long as two weeks, according to one of Trump's lawyers.

Merchan also indicated opposition to allowing Trump to be out of court next Thursday, when the US Supreme Court will hear his claims of presidential immunity in another, unrelated case.

"It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt," Trump said leaving court on Monday. "We've got a real problem with this judge."

The Republican presidential candidate is accused of falsifying business records in a scheme to cover up an alleged extramarital sexual encounter with adult film actress Stormy Daniels to shield his first election campaign, in 2016, from last-minute upheaval.

He faces three other criminal cases centered on his hoarding of top-secret documents after leaving office and his unprecedented attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden. (AFP)]]>

    'Rust' armorer sentenced to 18 months for on-set death

    <![CDATA[The armorer who loaded the gun that killed a cinematographer on the set of the Alec Baldwin movie "Rust" was sentenced to 18 months in prison by a US court on Monday.

Hannah Gutierrez stood impassive as a judge in New Mexico told her she would serve the maximum sentence after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the October 2021 death of Halyna Hutchins during filming of the budget Western.

"You were the armorer, the one that stood between a safe weapon and a weapon that could kill someone. You alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon," Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said.

"But for you, Miss Hutchins would be alive. A husband would have his partner and a little boy would have his mother."

Gutierrez's 10-day trial had heard how despite being the person responsible for on-set firearms, the 26-year-old had repeatedly failed to follow basic safety rules, leaving guns unattended and allowing actors – including Baldwin – to wave weapons around.

It also heard how she was responsible for the presence of six live rounds – a movie industry red line – and how she had loaded one of them into the Colt 45 that Baldwin was using.

The weapon discharged as the actor was preparing a scene inside a wooden church, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.

"Halyna Hutchins died due to a cascade of safety violations that began with Miss Gutierrez introducing live rounds to the movie set, loading one into a prop gun telling the members of the crew that it was a cold gun," prosecutor Kari Morrissey told the sentencing hearing in Santa Fe.

"That conduct absent responsibility or remorse is deserving of a sentence of 18 months."

Morrissey told the judge that Gutierrez had made around 200 calls from jail since her conviction, in which she complained that she was being unfairly victimised.

"Rather than accept responsibility, she has chosen to place blame on the witnesses who testified against her, me, you, the jurors, the set Medic and the paramedics who tried to save Miss Hutchins life," Morrissey said.

"Her jail calls... tell us who Miss Gutierrez really is."

Gutierrez sobbed as she begged the court for probation, rather than jail time, but insisted that she was not wholly to blame.

"Your Honour, when I took on 'Rust,' I was young and I was naive. But I took my job as seriously as I knew how to, despite not having proper time, resources and staffing.

"The jury has found me in part at fault for this god awful tragedy. but that doesn't make me a monster. That makes me human," she said.

Baldwin, who was also a producer on the movie, faces his own involuntary manslaughter trial in July. He denies the charge.

If convicted, he too faces a possible 18 months in prison.

Dave Halls, the film's safety coordinator and assistant director, who handed Baldwin the loaded gun, agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors last year and was sentenced to six months' probation.

The tragedy sent shock waves through Hollywood and led to calls for a complete ban on the use of weapons on movie sets.

Industry insiders, however, insisted that rules were already in place to prevent such incidents, and that those working on "Rust" had not followed them.

The filming of "Rust" was halted by the tragedy, but completed last year on location in Montana.

The cinematographer's widower, Matthew Hutchins, who has already settled a wrongful death suit with "Rust" producers, served as an executive producer.

No release date has been announced. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[A knife attack at a live-streamed church service in Australia wounded four people on Monday and sparked clashes between riot police and outraged members of the local community.

A bishop and the 15-year-old suspect were among those being treated for "non-life threatening injuries" after the attack at an Assyrian Christian church in the west of Sydney.

Police said the suspect is being held at an undisclosed location after his alleged attack provoked communal violence that also left two officers hospitalised.

The incident came two days after a man with a knife killed six people at a shopping mall in the city's east before being shot dead by police.

Graphic footage of Monday's stabbing showed the suspect emerging from the congregation, rushing the dais and slashing wildly at Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel before being subdued by churchgoers.

Social media accounts leapt on news of the attack to make claims about the motive, none of which were verified by police.

There were tense scenes outside the church after Monday's attack, with hundreds of angry members of the local community trying to make their way past a phalanx of riot police to reach the suspect.

A journalist at the scene saw projectiles being hurled before police with riot shields and body armour pushed the protesters away from the church.

New South Wales acting assistant police commissioner Andrew Holland said the crowd had displayed an "emotional response to what took place in the church" – fuelled by rumours and graphic images circulating on the internet.

Two police vehicles and a number of houses were damaged as the protesters threw "bottles, bricks and other items," Holland said.

One officer was "hit with a metal object and sustained a twisted knee and a chipped tooth," police said.

"Another constable sustained a broken jaw after he was hit with a brick and a fence paling."

Police urged the public to avoid the area amid "a large police response."

The video of Monday's attack was taken at the Christ the Good Shepherd Church, which has an online following of almost 200,000.

It is located in Sydney's western suburb of Wakeley, a hub for Sydney's small Christian Assyrian community, many of whom fled persecution and war in Iraq and Syria.

New South Wales state premier Chris Minns issued a joint statement with Christian and Muslim leaders calling for calm.

"We're calling on everyone to act with kindness and respect for each other," the statement said.

"Now is the time to show that we are strong and united."

Assyrians trace their roots to an empire that ruled a swathe of the ancient Middle East.

Since that age of empire, they have faced persecution as a religious and ethnic minority distinct from the region's Arab and Muslim majorities.

Australians are still reeling from Saturday's stabbing, which was carried out by a 40-year-old man with a history of mental illness.

In that attack, videos shared on social media showed unshaven itinerant Joel Cauchi pursuing mostly female victims as he rampaged through the vast, crowded Westfield shopping complex in Bondi Junction on Saturday afternoon.

A black ribbon was projected onto the Sydney Opera House on Monday as a mark of respect for the victims of that attack. (AFP)]]>

    France hosts Sudan talks a year into 'forgotten' war

    <![CDATA[France and its allies on Monday sought to drum up hundreds of millions in aid for Sudan a year since civil war erupted, sparking one of the world's worst and most under-funded humanitarian crises.

Tens of thousands of people have been killed and 8.5 million more forced to flee their homes since fighting broke out on April 15 last year between rival generals.

Sudan is experiencing "one of the worst humanitarian disasters in recent memory," with more people displaced inside the country than anywhere else in the world and a fast-growing hunger crisis, the United Nations says.

At the conference in Paris, France is seeking contributions from the international community and attention to a crisis that officials say is being crowded out of the global conversation by conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.

"For a year the Sudanese people have been the victims of a terrible war," French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said. Yet they had also suffered from "being forgotten" and "indifference."

"This is the reason for our meetings today: to break the silence surrounding this conflict and mobilise the international community," he said in opening remarks.

The conference, co-hosted by Germany and the European Union, was to include a ministerial meeting on political matters as well as a humanitarian meeting to raise funds.

Aid workers say a year of war has led to a catastrophe, but the world has turned away from the country of 48 million as conflict rages between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.

Only five percent of the 3.8-billion-euro (US$4.1 billion) target in the UN's latest humanitarian appeal had been funded ahead of the conference this year, according to France's foreign ministry.

At the opening, a total of 840 million euros (US$895 million) had been pledged after announcements from France, Germany, the European Union and the United States.

A diplomatic source, asking not to be named, said total donations could well top "a billion euros" by the end of the meeting.

On the fifth anniversary of a fire that ravaged the French capital's Notre Dame cathedral, Save the Children contrasted the lack of donations for Sudan with the international response to the Paris blaze.

"It is staggering that after a fire in which nobody died, donors from across the world were so moved to pledge funds to restore Notre Dame," said the charity's country director in Sudan, Arif Noor.

"Meanwhile, children in Sudan are left to fend for themselves as war rages around them, starvation and disease are on the increase and almost the entire country's child population has been out of school for a year."

Fourteen million children need humanitarian assistance to survive, Save the Children says.

According to Will Carter, Sudan country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, civilians in Sudan are "enduring starvation, mass sexual violence, large-scale ethnic killing, and executions."

"Millions more are displaced, and yet the world continues to look the other way," he said earlier.

An estimated 1.8 million people have fled Sudan – many to neighbouring Chad, now also suffering a humanitarian crisis – and 6.7 million have been internally displaced.

Human Rights Watch says warring parties have blocked access for humanitarian assistance, pillaged foreign financial aid and targeted humanitarian workers in attacks.

The head of the UN's food agency warned the world should not wait for famine to be officially declared.

"Our goal now is to be able to get in... About 90 percent of the population can't be reached right now," WFP director Cindy McCain said.

"When we start talking about is there famine, is there not famine, the truth is we don't know because we can't get in."

The ministerial meeting, behind closed doors, brings together representatives from Sudan's neighbours, as well as from Gulf nations and Western powers, including the United States and Britain, along with regional organisations and the United Nations.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock lamented the failure of mediation efforts so far and urged "better coordination."

Chad's Foreign Minister Mahamat Saleh Annadif urged "pressure for there to be an immediate ceasefire."

"If we continue like this, in a year's time, Sudan risks disintegrating," he said. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday announced he would step down as premier on May 15 and hand over power to his successor Lawrence Wong.

Wong, 51, is currently the deputy prime minister and finance minister of Singapore, and has been prime minister-in-waiting since 2022.

In a statement posted on the website of the Prime Minister's Office, Lee called the leadership transition a "significant moment".

"I will relinquish my role as Prime Minister on 15 May 2024 and Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong will be sworn in as the next Prime Minister on the same day. Lawrence and...team have worked hard to gain the people's trust, notably during the pandemic."

An election is expected to follow in the months after the handover of power.

Lee, whose father was the island state's founder Lee Kuan Yew, has served as prime minister of Singapore and leader of the ruling People's Action Party since 2004. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[A Chinese woman studying in Australia was one of six people killed when a 40-year-old knifeman rampaged through a Sydney shopping centre at the weekend, the prime minister said Monday.

Yixuan Cheng, the last of the victims to be identified from Saturday's attack, "has lost her life," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a radio interview.

Meanwhile Australian police said the attacker may have targeted women, as the country mourned the victims and hundreds of people laid flowers near the scene.

In the attack on Saturday, five of the six people killed and the majority of the 12 injured were women. Police said on Monday they had finished taking physical evidence at the Westfield Bondi Junction mall.

"It's obvious to me, it's obvious to detectives that seems to be an area of interest that the offender focused on women and avoided the men," New South Wales state Police Commissioner Karen Webb told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.

"The videos speak for themselves, don't they? That's certainly a line for inquiry for us."

Witnesses described how attacker Joel Cauchi, 40, wearing shorts and an Australian national rugby league jersey, ran through the mall with a knife. He was killed by Inspector Amy Scott, who confronted him solo while he was on the rampage.

Police have said Cauchi had mental health issues in the past and there was no indication ideology was a motive.

Violent crimes such as Saturday's stabbing are rare in the country of about 27 million people, which has some of the world's toughest gun and knife laws. (AFP/Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned the international community on Sunday against deeper descent into conflict, addressing the Security Council during a meeting over Iran's weekend attack on Israel.

"Neither the region nor the world can afford more war," Guterres said.

"The Middle East is on the brink," he told the Security Council.

"The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict. Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate," he added, calling for "maximum restraint."

Late on Saturday, Iran launched a direct attack on its long-time arch foe Israel for the first time, firing a wave of more than 300 missiles and drones.

Nearly all of them were intercepted by Israel and others, including the United States, Jordan and Britain.

According to the Israeli army, 12 people were injured.

Iran said its attack came in response to a deadly April 1 air strike on Tehran's consulate building in the Syrian capital Damascus that was widely blamed on Israel.

That attack killed seven Iranian Revolutionary Guards, including two senior generals, and prompted Iranian threats of retaliation.

The unprecedented exchange, marking a major escalation between the two countries, has sparked renewed fears of a broader conflict, including the potential for an Israel counterstrike.

The United States said on Sunday it will not join any Israeli counterattack on Iran, with President Joe Biden warning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to "think carefully" about any escalation.

The rising tensions come against the backdrop of Israel's six-month-old war against Hamas in Gaza, which began after the Palestinian militant group's unprecedented attack in Israel October 7 which resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 33,729 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Since the start of the conflict, Iran-backed groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen have carried out a flurry of attacks on Israeli and Western targets.

Sunday's Security Council meeting to address the simmering crisis came at Israel's request.

During his speech, Guterres repeated his condemnation of Iran's strikes on Israel, and the Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.

"It's time to step back from the brink. It is vital to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East," Guterres said.

He also repeated his call for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire" in Gaza, which experts warn is on the verge of famine. (AFP)]]>

    Ukraine says situation 'tense' on eastern front

    <![CDATA[Ukraine on Sunday said the situation was "tense" on its eastern front, where the Russian army is doubling down on efforts to seize the strategic town of Chassiv Iar.

Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said he had visited troops on the frontier, where Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and running low on ammunition.

He said "the situation is tense," a day after Kyiv warned that the situation on its eastern front was significantly worsening.

If Moscow manages to capture Chassiv Iar, it would "create conditions for a deeper advance" towards the key Ukrainian transport hub of Kramatorsk, said Ukraine's commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky.

Kramatorsk town is the major rail and logistics hub for the Ukrainian army, 30 kilometres from Chassiv Iar.

Russia has been trying to break through to the west of Bakhmut – a town conquered by the Russians in May 2023 after a bloody battle – according to Umerov.

In recent weeks, Moscow has claimed the capture of several small villages, notably near the industrial town of Avdiivka on Saturday.

It has also ramped up its aerial bombardments on Ukraine's infrastructure in recent weeks, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying the Kremlin was aiming to drive people from its second city Kharkiv.

"Rhetoric does not protect the sky," Zelenskyy said on Sunday. 

Zelenskyy said that only "tangible assistance" can stop missiles and drones, adding a plea for the release of US war aid for Ukraine that has long been blocked by Congress. (AFP)]]>

    World urges restraint after Iran's attack on Israel

    <![CDATA[World leaders urged restraint on Sunday after Iran launched an unprecedented wave of missiles and attack drones against its arch foe Israel overnight, at a time the Gaza war has inflamed Middle East tensions.

Iran launched the attack, its first ever to directly target Israeli territory, in retaliation for a deadly air strike widely blamed on Israel that destroyed its consular building in Syria's capital early this month.

Israel and its allies intercepted the vast majority of the incoming projectiles, the Israeli army said, reporting 12 people injured and no deaths, but the attack sharply heightened fears of an Israeli counterstrike.

G7 leaders condemned Iran's unprecedented attack and called for "restraint" on all sides, European Council President Charles Michel wrote on X following a video conference and ahead of a planned 2000 GMT meeting of the UN Security Council.

"We will continue all our efforts to work towards de-escalation. Ending the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible, notably through an immediate ceasefire, will make a difference."

Israel's top ally the United States also urged caution and calm.

"We don't want to see this escalate," White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told NBC. "We're not looking for a wider war with Iran."

President Joe Biden reaffirmed "ironclad" US support for Israel, but also appeared to guide its ally away from a military response against their common adversary Iran.

News outlet Axios reported that Biden had told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he should "take the win" and that Washington would oppose an Israeli counterattack.

Before Tehran attacked, Israel's military had warned Iran it would suffer the "consequences for choosing to escalate the situation any further."

Netanyahu was on Sunday meeting his war cabinet, put in place amid the Gaza conflict sparked by the October 7 attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Through the night, air raid sirens wailed and Israeli citizens sought cover in bunkers and shelters, as missile defence systems and fighter-jets intercepted drones and missiles in the night skies.

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday warned Israel against a "reckless" retaliation, warning that this would spark "a decisive and much stronger response."

Iran's mission to the United Nations also warned Washington to keep out of its conflict with Israel.

It added in a message on X that "the matter can be deemed concluded." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[A small evening vigil was held on Sunday for the six people killed in a knife attack at a busy Sydney shopping centre, which police said was carried out by a local man with a history of mental illness.

Mourners gathered in silent reflection outside the Westfield mall in Bondi Junction, which had been packed with weekend shoppers when 40-year-old itinerant Joel Cauchi went on a stabbing rampage on Saturday.

Police said five women and a Pakistani security guard were killed in the attack, which lasted for about half an hour, until a solo policewoman tracked down Cauchi and shot him dead.

Inspector Amy Scott was hailed by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as a "hero" who "no doubt" had "saved lives through her action."

Among Cauchi's victims were a designer, a volunteer surf lifesaver, the daughter of an entrepreneur, and a new mother whose nine-month-old baby is still in hospital with serious stab wounds.

As night fell on Sunday, a group of about 40 people from a local Muslim association placed flowers on the ever-growing pile outside the shopping centre.

They remembered 30-year-old Faraz Tahir, who had been working as a security guard when he was stabbed.

They stood for a minute of silence with their hands clasped, heads bowed and eyes fixated on the flowers.

The mourners then raised their hands in a moment of prayer. Many wiped away tears.

Australians, largely unaccustomed to violent crime, are still coming to terms with an attack that shattered a city better known for its famed beaches and laid-back bars and restaurants.

On any given weekend the Westfield shopping centre is packed with people shopping for clothes or groceries, with families grabbing a bite to eat or a movie.

Health officials said it would take many eyewitnesses a lifetime to come to terms with what they saw and felt.

"The sound of people screaming was horrific," said one eyewitness, Daphi Kiselstein, who was shopping at the time of the attack and took refuge in a store with other terrified shoppers.

Despite early social media reports falsely linking the attack to events in the Middle East, New South Wales police Assistant Commissioner Anthony Cooke said there was no evidence that Cauchi was "driven by any particular motivation, ideology or otherwise."

Police said he was diagnosed with a mental health issue at age 17.

In a pained statement, Cauchi's parents offered thoughts for the victims and said their son's actions were "truly horrific."

"We are still trying to comprehend what has happened. He has battled with mental health issues since he was a teenager."

The parents also sent a message to the officer who shot their son dead.

"She was only doing her job to protect others and we hope she is coping alright," they said.

Cauchi is believed to have travelled to Sydney about a month ago and hired a small storage unit in the city, according to police. It contained personal belongings, including a boogie board.

He had been living in a vehicle and hostels, and was only in sporadic contact with his family via text messages, his parents said.

A Facebook profile said Cauchi came from Toowoomba, near Brisbane, and had attended a local high school and university.

A distinctive grey, red and yellow dragon tattoo on his right arm was used to help identify him. (AFP)]]>
