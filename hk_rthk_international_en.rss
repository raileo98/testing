    Taylor Swift, 'tortured poet', new album breaks record

    <![CDATA[Taylor Swift's hotly anticipated "The Tortured Poets Department" is here along with a surprise second album - 31 tracks released on Friday in which the megastar purges her inner turmoil while scorching former lovers.

The first album was released as scheduled at midnight (0400 GMT) but two hours later, an additional 15 tracks appeared - giving legions of Swifties plenty to chew on.

By Friday evening, platform Spotify declared the album its most-streamed in a single day, with Swift also becoming the most-streamed artist in a single day.

"I'd written so much tortured poetry in the past 2 years and wanted to share it all with you, so here's the second installment of TTPD: The Anthology. 15 extra songs. And now the story isn't mine anymore... it's all yours," she posted on social media in revealing the extra music.

Swift's album comes on the heels of a remarkably successful and busy year for the artist, whose "Midnights" won her a record-setting fourth Album of the Year Grammy.

She put on the first tour to break the $1 billion mark and is on track to make a second billion by the time it's over.

Swift also released two re-recordings of her earlier albums to resounding success, and broke box office records with an Eras Tour film.

But she also ended a six-year relationship with the British actor Joe Alwyn, after which she was linked to - and dramatically de-linked from - front man Matty Healy of the 1975.

Now she's dating NFL star Travis Kelce, whose Kansas City Chiefs just won the Super Bowl.

And all of the drama is immortalized in song.

When she announced "TTPD," Swift said it would be "an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time -- one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure."

"This period of the author's life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up." (AFP)]]>

    Man dies after setting self ablaze outside Trump trial

    <![CDATA[A man has died on Saturday after setting himself on fire outside the New York courthouse where Donald Trump’s hush-money trial was taking place.

Police identified the man as Max Azzarello, from Florida, who was rushed to hospital in critical condition after police on the scene tried to extinguish the fire.   

He was later pronounced dead by the hospital. 

It was not clear whether the self-immolation had anything to do with Trump's case, but the gruesome incident occurred on the street outside the building where the ex-president and current White House hopeful sat on the 15th floor.

The shocking development came shortly after jury selection for the trial was completed, clearing the way for prosecutors and defense attorneys to make opening statements on Monday in a case stemming from hush money paid to a porn star. The court adjourned later in the afternoon.

The 12 jurors, along with six alternates, will consider evidence in a first-ever trial to determine whether a former U.S. president is guilty of breaking the law. Prosecutors intend to call at least 20 witnesses, according to Trump defense lawyer Susan Necheles.

Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of business fraud as part of a scheme to cover up hush money paid to a porn star so that the story would not come out just before the 2016 presidential election, in which he beat Hillary Clinton.

If convicted, he could face prison but would more likely be fined. (Agencies)

    WHO raises alarm after finding H5N1 in milk

    <![CDATA[The H5N1 bird flu virus strain has been detected in very high concentrations in raw milk from infected animals, the WHO said on Friday, though how long the virus can survive in milk is unknown.

Avian influenza A(H5N1) first emerged in 1996 but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, alongside an increase in the number of infected mammals.

The strain has led to the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, with wild birds and land and marine mammals also infected.

Cows and goats joined the list last month -- a surprising development for experts because they were not thought to be susceptible to this type of influenza.

US authorities earlier this month said a person working on a dairy farm in Texas was recovering from bird flu after being exposed to cattle.

"The case in Texas is the first case of a human infected by avian influenza by a cow," said Wenqing Zhang, head of the global influenza programme at the World Health Organization.

"Bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow and cow-to-bird transmission have also been registered during these current outbreaks, which suggest that the virus may have found other routes of transition than we previously understood," she told a media briefing in Geneva.

It was only the second case of a human testing positive for bird flu in the United States, and came after the virus sickened herds that were apparently exposed to wild birds.

"Now we see multiple herds of cows affected in an increasing number of US states, which shows a further step of the virus spillover to mammals," Zhang said.

"The virus has also been detected in milk from infected animals."

Zhang said there was a "very high virus concentration in raw milk", but experts were still investigating exactly how long the virus is able to survive in milk.

The Texas health department has said the cattle infections do not present a concern for the commercial milk supply, as dairies are required to destroy milk from sick cows. Pasteurisation also kills the virus.

"It is important for people to ensure safe food practices, including consuming only pasteurised milk and milk products," said Zhang.

From 2003 to April 1 this year, the WHO said it had recorded 463 deaths from 889 human cases across 23 countries, putting the case fatality rate at 52 percent.

Zhang noted that the human cases recorded in Europe and the United States in the past few years -- since the virus surged -- have been mild cases.

So far, there is no evidence that A(H5N1) is spreading between humans. (AFP)]]>

    Nato to help Ukraine beef up air defences

    <![CDATA[Nato countries have agreed to give Ukraine more air defences after desperate pleas from Kyiv for advanced systems to shoot down Russian attacks, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday.

"Nato defence ministers have agreed to step up and provide further military support, including more air defence," Stoltenberg said after virtual talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

"Nato has mapped out existing capabilities across the alliance and there are systems that can be made available to Ukraine," he said.

"So I expect new announcements on air defence capabilities for Ukraine soon."

Ukraine has been urgently calling on its Western backers to send more air defences as it has struggled to fend off a surge in Russian attacks on its infrastructure in recent weeks.

Kyiv has above all been calling for more US-designed Patriot systems that are capable of shooting down Russian hypersonic missiles.

Stoltenberg said there were Patriot and also Franco-Italian SAMP/T systems available in stocks of Nato countries that can be given to Ukraine.

But he could not say whether Nato defence ministers had made concrete commitments during the meeting.

Germany earlier this week announced it was giving Ukraine an additional Patriot system, on top of two already supplied.

Officials say that the United States, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Greece, Romania and Poland are the Nato countries with Patriot systems.

US lawmakers will vote on Saturday on a long-stalled US$61-billion aid package for Ukraine that allies hope will reopen support from Washington.

"I count on the bill to pass without further delay," Stoltenberg said.

The hold-up in support from Washington and struggles by Europe to find enough weaponry have left outgunned Ukrainian forces struggling to hold back Moscow's troops.

Stoltenberg said that ministers also discussed Kyiv's "many other pressing needs", including artillery shells, longer range missiles and drones.

"Each NATO ally will decide what to provide. Several allies made concrete commitments during the meeting and are finalising contributions that I expect will be announced soon," he said. (AFP)]]>

    'Israel retaliates, strikes central Iran'

    <![CDATA[Iran's state media reported explosions in the central province of Isfahan on Friday, as US media quoted officials saying Israel had carried out retaliatory strikes on its arch-rival.

Iranian media said no major damage was reported.

"Reports indicate there was no major damage or large explosions caused by the impact of any air threat," the official IRNA news agency said.

Air defence systems over several Iranian cities had been activated.

Israel had previously warned it would hit back after Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel over the weekend. Most of them were intercepted. It followed an April 1 strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that was widely blamed on Israel.

Iran's Fars news agency reported "three explosions" were heard near the Shekari army airbase in the northwest of Isfahan province, while Iran's space agency spokesman Hossein Dalirian said "several" drones had been "successfully shot down".

"There are no reports of a missile attack for now," Dalirian said on social media platform X.

Nuclear facilities in Isfahan were reported to be "completely secure", Iran's Tasnim news agency reported, citing "reliable sources".

ABC and CBS News reported the strikes had been carried out by Israel, quoting US officials. There was no immediate comment from the White House or Pentagon.

CNN quoted an official as saying the target of the Israeli attack was not nuclear.

The Israeli military told AFP: "We don't have a comment at this time."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has vowed to destroy Hamas over its October 7 attack that started the Gaza war, has stressed that Israel "reserves the right to protect itself" against Iran.

The United States, Israel's main ally and military supplier, has made clear it would not join a reprisal attack on Iran, but unveiled sanctions against people and entities involved in producing the drones deployed in the Iranian assault.

"We are holding Iran accountable," US President Joe Biden said on Thursday, announcing the measures after the European Union said it would also sanction Iran's drone programme.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian had warned that Tehran would make Israel "regret" any attack on the Islamic republic.

Flights were suspended across swathes of Iran on Friday.

"Iran's air defence has been activated in the skies of several provinces of the country," Tehran's official IRNA news agency said.

Mehr news agency reported that "flights to Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz, and airports in the west, northwest and southwest have been suspended."

Flight-tracking software showed commercial flights avoiding western Iran, including Isfahan, and skirting Tehran to the north and east.

On Thursday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres painted a dark picture of the situation in the Middle East, warning that spiralling tensions over the war in Gaza and Iran's attack on Israel could devolve into a "full-scale regional conflict."

"The Middle East is on a precipice. Recent days have seen a perilous escalation – in words and deeds," Guterres told the Security Council.

"One miscalculation, one miscommunication, one mistake, could lead to the unthinkable – a full-scale regional conflict that would be devastating for all involved," he said, calling on all parties to exercise "maximum restraint." (AFP)]]>

    Hindu nationalist Modi the favourite as India votes

    <![CDATA[India began voting on Friday in a six-week election with an all but assured victory for Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as a weakened opposition is pushed to the sidelines.

A total of 968 million people are eligible to take part in the world's biggest vote – a staggering logistical exercise that critics say follows a concerted effort to delegitimise rivals.

A long and winding queue was patiently assembled outside a polling station in the Hindu holy city of Haridwar, on the banks of the Ganges river, even before the booths opened.

"I am here because I am happy about the direction the country is headed," said autorickshaw driver Ganga Singh, 27. "I will vote keeping in mind not personal welfare but the country's prosperity."

Modi, 73, remains resoundingly popular after a decade in office that has seen India rise as an economic power.

"I urge all those voting... to exercise their franchise in record numbers," he wrote in a social media post on X as the election began. "Every vote counts and every voice matters!"

Modi has already led the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party through two landslide victories in 2014 and 2019, forged in large part by his appeals to the Hindu faithful.

His prospects have been further bolstered by several criminal probes into his opponents and a tax investigation this year that froze the bank accounts of Congress, India's largest opposition party.

Opposition figures and human rights organisations have accused Modi's government of orchestrating the probes to weaken rivals. (AFP)]]>

    Nato head urges G7 countries to do more for Ukraine

    <![CDATA[Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told a G7 meeting on Thursday that Ukraine had an "urgent, critical need for more air defence", as Kyiv's foreign minister pressed allies for more Patriot systems.

Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven developed nations, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, are gathering on the Italian island of Capri from Wednesday to Friday.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba joined counterparts from Italy, the UK, the US, Japan, Canada, France and Germany for a working session dedicated to the conflict on Thursday.

Kuleba called for other countries to follow Germany, which at the weekend said it was sending an additional Patriot air defence system to Kyiv.

"We will work here at the ministerial (meeting) to make other allies deliver air-defence systems to Ukraine, because it's of fundamental importance," Kuleba told reporters ahead of the session.

Ukraine has said it is running out of weaponry to shoot down Russian missiles and drones as Moscow has ramped up its attacks on infrastructure across the country.

Stoltenberg said there had been "important, encouraging signs" of new support from NATO allies, including the scheduling of a US Congressional vote this weekend on a long-stalled aid package.

"It's of vital importance that Nato allies sustain and step up their support... There's an urgent, critical need for more air defence," Stoltenberg said.

Earlier, Blinken stressed the need for the US Congress to agree to the new aid.

"At this moment, it is urgent that all of the friends and supporters of Ukraine maximise their efforts to provide... Ukraine with what it needs to continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression," Blinken said.

Kubela said the help would "literally, without exaggeration, help save Ukrainians from Russian missile slaughter".

"This is a matter of death and life."

After the day's talks, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani -- whose country holds the rotating G7 presidency this year -- said allies had confirmed "our maximum commitment" to Kyiv.

He confirmed ministers discussed the potential use of Russian assets frozen after the February 2022 invasion to help Ukraine.

"We are evaluating (the idea) in principle, we are also in favour of using the seized assets, but we need the legal basis to do so," Tajani said.

British Foreign Secretary David Cameron called earlier in Capri for "creative" way of using the assets, saying it was "important we try and get agreement" on how.

There have been mounting calls in Washington and Europe to set up a fund for Ukraine using billions of dollars in Russian bank accounts, investments and other assets frozen by the West after the invasion.

The EU froze some 200 billion euros of Russian central bank assets held in the bloc as part of sanctions on Moscow. (AFP)]]>

    EU reaches out to Britain over youth mobility

    <![CDATA[The EU said on Thursday it wants to make it easy once again for its young people to live, study and work in Britain, and vice versa -- a freedom hit hard by Brexit.

When Britain formally left the European Union in 2020, one of the changes most felt by the bloc's citizens was that they could no longer move as they wished to the United Kingdom for study or work.

Now, the European Commission says it is time to repair that -- at least for those aged 18 to 30 -- and wants the 27 EU nations to approve talks after London expressed interest in youth mobility.

Britain left the European student exchange scheme Erasmus after Brexit, but the commission said that should the UK wish to rejoin, it remained "open" to the idea.

The UK government appeared to pour cold water on the proposal, however, preferring bilateral schemes with individual countries.

The Commission's proposal envisages setting university fees in Britain and the bloc at the same level for EU and UK students, as it was before Brexit.

According to the commission, tuition for non-UK residents at British universities now averages 22,000 pounds (HK$214,540) a year, compared to around 9,000 pounds for residents.

The EU said that by comparison the fees in the bloc's universities were "not that high".

Under the commission's plans, young EU and UK citizens would be able to stay in the country of their choice for up to four years and visa fees would not be "excessive".

Currently a young person from the EU seeking to study in the UK must pay £490 while a skilled worker visa costs between £719 and £1,639, it said.

There is also an extra cost for healthcare running into the hundreds of pounds that the commission wants to scrap.

Unlike visas for work or study, which are often limited to specific institutions or jobs, the idea would be that young people can be free to move between the UK and EU countries and undertake different activities.

Commission executive vice president Maros Sefcovic said Brexit had hit young people who wanted to study, work and live abroad "particularly hard".

"Today, we take the first step towards an ambitious but realistic agreement between the EU and the UK that would fix this issue. Our aim is to rebuild human bridges between young Europeans on both sides of the Channel," he added.

A spokeswoman for the UK government suggested it favours its current approach of brokering such agreements with individual countries rather than the European Union as a whole. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Google fired 28 employees following a disruptive sit-down protest over the tech giant's contract with the Israeli government, a Google spokesperson said on Thursday.

The Tuesday demonstration was organized by the group "No Tech for Apartheid," which has long opposed "Project Nimbus," Google's joint US$1.2 billion contract with Amazon to provide cloud services to the government of Israel.

Video of the demonstration showed police arresting Google workers in Sunnyvale, California, in the office of Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian's, according to a post by the advocacy group on X, formerly Twitter.

Kurian's office was occupied for 10 hours, the advocacy group said.

Workers held signs including "Googlers against Genocide," a reference to accusations surrounding Israel's attacks on Gaza.

"No Tech for Apartheid," which also held protests in New York and Seattle, pointed to an April 12 Time magazine article reporting a draft contract of Google billing the Israeli Ministry of Defense more than US$1 million for consulting services.

A "small number" of employees "disrupted" a few Google locations, but the protests are "part of a long-standing campaign by a group of organizations and people who largely don't work at Google," a Google spokesperson said.

"After refusing multiple requests to leave the premises, law enforcement was engaged to remove them to ensure office safety," the Google spokesperson said. "We have so far concluded individual investigations that resulted in the termination of employment for 28 employees, and will continue to investigate and take action as needed."

Israel is one of "numerous" governments for which Google provides cloud computing services, the Google spokesperson said.

"This work is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services," the Google spokesperson said. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Two German-Russian men have been arrested on suspicion of spying for Russia and planning attacks in Germany -- including on US army targets -- to undermine military support for Ukraine, prosecutors said on Thursday.

The pair, identified only as Dieter S. and Alexander J., were arrested in Bayreuth in the southeastern state of Bavaria on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement.

The main accused, Dieter S., is alleged to have scouted potential targets for attacks, "including facilities of the US armed forces" stationed in Germany.

Police have searched both men's homes and places of work.

They are suspected of "having been active for a foreign intelligence service" in what prosecutors described as a "particularly serious case" of espionage.

Interior Minister Nancy Faeser likewise called the allegations "a particularly serious case of suspected agent activity for (Vladimir) Putin's criminal regime".

"We will continue to thwart such threat plans," she said, reiterating Germany's steadfast support for Ukraine.

Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock summoned the Russian ambassador over the arrests, the ministry in Berlin said.

According to prosecutors, Dieter S. had been exchanging information with a person linked to Russian intelligence services since October 2023, discussing possible acts of sabotage.

"The actions were intended, in particular, to undermine the military support provided from Germany to Ukraine against the Russian aggression," prosecutors said.

The accused allegedly expressed readiness to "commit explosive and arson attacks mainly on military infrastructure and industrial sites in Germany".

Dieter S. collected information about potential targets, "including facilities of the US armed forces".

Fellow accused Alexander J. began assisting him from March 2024, they added.

Dieter S. scouted potential targets by taking photos and videos of military transport and equipment. He then allegedly shared the information with his contact person.

Der Spiegel magazine reported that the military facilities spied on included the US army base in Grafenwoehr in Bavaria.

"Among other things, there is an important military training area there where the US army trains Ukrainian soldiers, for example on Abrams battle tanks," Der Spiegel wrote.

Dieter S. faces an additional charge of belonging to a "foreign terrorist organisation". Prosecutors said they suspect he was a fighter in an armed unit of eastern Ukraine's self-proclaimed pro-Russian "People's Republic of Donetsk" in 2014-2016.

Germany is Ukraine's second-largest supplier of military aid, and news of the spy arrests came as Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck was on a visit to Kyiv. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The US and Britain on Thursday imposed a new round of sanctions on Iran as concern grows that Tehran’s unprecedented attack on Israel could fuel a wider war in the Middle East.

The US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control targeted 16 people and two entities in Iran that produce engines which power the drones used in the April 13 attack on Israel. Additionally, Britain is targeting several Iranian military organisations, individuals and entities involved in Iran’s drone and ballistic missile industries.

“We will continue to deploy our sanctions authority to counter Iran with further actions in the days and weeks ahead," US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.

The action comes after US officials earlier this week warned that they were readying new sanctions in response to Iran’s activity in the region and to prevent future attacks. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill also have been quickly pushing forward legislation that would financially punish the Islamic Republic and its leaders.

Tehran says it launched the April 13 attack in retaliation for Israel's suspected April 1 strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus. Israel has said it will retaliate, while a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander on Thursday said Iran could review its "nuclear doctrine" following Israeli threats. (AP/Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Legendary Japanese animators Studio Ghibli will receive an honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May, organisers announced on Wednesday.

The Oscar-winning studio, co-founded by Hayao Miyazaki 40 years ago, is beloved worldwide for its masterpieces like "Spirited Away", "My Neighbour Totoro" and "Howl's Moving Castle".

It will mark the first that that Cannes gives an award to a collective, rather than an individual.

Miyazaki makes few public appearances and his long-time collaborator Isao Takahata died in 2018.

The other founder, producer Toshio Suzuki, said he was "truly honoured and delighted" to be receiving the award.

Ghibli's "characters populate our imaginations with prolific, colourful universes and sensitive, engaging narrations," said the Cannes organisers in a statement.

"With Ghibli, Japanese animation stands as one of the great adventures of cinephilia, between tradition and modernity," they added.

Miyazaki, 83, has announced his retirement more than once, but was back in cinemas last year with "The Boy and the Heron", which won the Oscar for best animated film last month, his second after "Spirited Away" in 2003.

It was already announced that another huge figure in cinematic storytelling, George Lucas, creator of "Star Wars", would also receive an honorary Palme at this year's festival, which runs from May 14 to 25. (AFP)]]>

    Boeing safety in spotlight before US Senate

    <![CDATA[Boeing's safety culture and manufacturing quality, both at the centre of a full-blown crisis following a January mid-air panel blowout, faced scrutiny on Wednesday in two US Senate hearings.

Boeing has been grappling with a safety crisis after the door plug panel blew off an Alaska Airlines flight that took off from Portland, Oregon, on January 5. The planemaker has undergone a management shakeup, US regulators have put curbs on its production, and deliveries fell by half in March.

Testimony at the US Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations raised questions about missing records surrounding the panel, along with production concerns over two separate Boeing widebody jets.

Former Boeing engineer Ed Pierson said he turned over records, sent to him from an internal whistleblower, to the FBI that he said provided information about the plug.

Boeing has said it believed that required documents detailing the removal of the door plug were never created. Boeing directed questions to the National Transportation Safety Board, which was not immediately available for comment.

The FBI declined to comment.

Whistleblower Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer who raised questions about two of the planemaker's widebody jets, claimed he was told to "shut up" when he flagged safety concerns. He has said that he was removed from the 787 programme and transferred to the 777 jet due to his questions.

Salehpour has claimed Boeing failed to adequately shim, or use a thin piece of material to fill tiny gaps in a manufactured product, an omission that could cause premature fatigue failure over time in some areas of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Salehpour said he had reached out to Boeing official Lisa Fahl but was not provided specific safety data.

Fahl has said the 787, which was launched in 2004, had a specification of five-thousandths of an inch gap allowance within a five-inch area, or "the thickness of a human hair."

"When you are operating at 35,000 feet," the size of a human hair can be a matter of life and death, Salehpour told the hearing. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[A volcano erupted several times in Indonesia's outermost region Wednesday, with authorities raising the alert level to its highest point after the dome spewed a column of smoke more than a mile into the sky and forced hundreds to evacuate.

Mount Ruang, a stratovolcano in North Sulawesi Province, first erupted at 9.45 pm on Tuesday and four times throughout Wednesday, the country's volcanology agency said.

The alert level for the volcano, which has a peak of 725 metres above sea level, was then raised on Wednesday evening from three to four, the highest possible level in the four-tiered system.

"Based on the result of visual and instrumental observation that showed an increase in volcanic activity, Mount Ruang's level was raised from Level 3 to Level 4," Hendra Gunawan, head of Indonesia's volcanology agency said in a statement late on Wednesday.

Authorities also widened a four-kilometre exclusion zone to six kilometres on Wednesday evening around the crater.

There were no reports of deaths or injuries, but more than 800 people were evacuated from two Ruang Island villages to nearby Tagulandang Island, which is located more than 100 kilometres north of provincial capital Manado, state agency Antara reported.

The volcanology agency said residents of Tagulandang must be evacuated outside the six-kilometre radius by Wednesday evening.

Gunawan also warned local residents to "be on alert for the potential ejection of rocks, hot cloud discharges and tsunami caused by the collapse of the volcano's body into the sea," the statement said.

Ruang's initial eruption late Tuesday pushed an ash column two kilometres into the sky, with the second eruption pushing it to 2.5 kilometres, Muhammad Wafid, head of the geological agency said in a statement earlier Wednesday.

The volcanology agency said Tuesday that volcanic activity had increased at Ruang after two earthquakes in recent weeks. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Police in Canada and the United States have arrested six people and are seeking three others in connection with the theft of over C$22 million (US$16 million) in gold and cash from an Air Canada cargo facility last year.

In what authorities described as the largest gold heist in Canadian history, suspects including an Air Canada employee forged an airway bill to steal the cargo that had arrived in Toronto from Zurich in April 2023.

The cargo contained 6,600 gold bars weighing 400 kilograms, worth over C$20 million, and C$2.5 million in foreign currency, the Peel regional police told reporters at a briefing.

The suspects have been hit with more than 19 charges by the authorities, who recovered one kilogram of gold and approximately C$434,000 in Canadian currency, police said.

The stolen gold may have been melted and reconstituted, making it difficult to track down, police said.

Police also recovered some 65 firearms that investigators allege were purchased from the proceeds of the theft.

"We believe that they've melted down the gold and then the profits they got from the gold, they use to help finance the firearms," Detective Sergeant Mike Mavity said.

Five suspects were arrested in Canada and conditionally released. One suspect, originally from Brampton, Ontario, was arrested in Pennsylvania along with the firearms and remains in custody in the United States. Canada-wide warrants have been issued for the remaining three suspects, police said.

Following the heist, Miami-based transport and security services provider Brinks sued Air Canada in October, alleging "negligence and carelessness" by the airline.

Brinks had been hired by Swiss bank Raiffeisen Schweiz and precious metals refining company Valcambi to move the valuables from Switzerland to Canada. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Three Russian missiles slammed into the city centre of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine on Wednesday, killing at least 17 people, wounding dozens more and damaging civilian buildings, officials said.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Kyiv's allies to rush in air defence support after the city, which had a pre-war population of 300,000, became the latest target of an intensifying Russian air strike campaign.

"This would not have happened if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence equipment and if the world's determination to counter Russian terror had been sufficient," Zelenskiy wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

Videos showed flames and columns of black smoke rising over Chernihiv, which is about 150 km from the capital Kyiv and about 80 km from the Russian border.

Three explosions ripped through a busy central area of the city just after 9am local time, destroying a hotel, officials said.

The strike also damaged several multi-storey residential buildings, a hospital, an education facility and dozens of private cars, officials said.

"Unfortunately, Russia continues to engage in terrorist activity against civilians and civilian infrastructure as confirmed by this strike on Chernihiv once again," acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako said on national television.

Sixty people, including three children, were wounded, the emergency services said.

Russia, which denies targeting civilians, attacked with three Iskander cruise missiles, governor Vyacheslav Chaus told the Suspilne public broadcaster. (Reuters)]]>

    Snake on a train delays Japanese bullet service

    <![CDATA[Even small delays in Japan's much-vaunted bullet trains are rare, and more unusual still are snakes on board holding up the speedy "shinkansen" services.

On Tuesday evening, a passenger alerted security to a 40-centimetre serpent lurking on a train between Nagoya and Tokyo, resulting in a 17-minute hold-up.

It was unclear whether the cold-blooded commuter was venomous or how it ended up on the train, and there was no injury or panic among passengers, a spokesman for Central Japan Railway Company said.

Shinkansen customers can bring small dogs, cats and other animals, including pigeons on board – but not snakes.

"It's difficult to imagine wild snakes somehow climbing onto the train at one of the stations. We have rules against bringing snakes into the shinkansen," the spokesman said.

"But we don't check passengers' baggage," he added.

The train was originally scheduled to go on to Osaka, but the company decided to use a different train for the trip, causing a delay of about 17 minutes, he said.

Patrols by uniformed security guards onboard bullet trains were scaled up after a fatal stabbing in 2018 on a shinkansen that shocked normally ultra-safe Japan.

Additional security was added for the Olympics in 2021 and Group of Seven meetings last year. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Dubai's major international airport began diverting all incoming flights on Tuesday as heavy rains lashed the city, causing widespread flooding.

The world's busiest air hub for international passengers, which had been expecting more than 100 flights on Tuesday evening, earlier briefly halted its operations in the chaos caused by the storm.

Dubai, the Middle East's financial centre, has been paralysed by the torrential rain that caused floods around the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and left 18 dead in Oman on Sunday and Monday.

"Due to the continued exceptional weather event currently being experienced in the UAE, Dubai International is temporarily diverting inbound flights due to arrive this evening... until the inclement situation improves," a Dubai Airports spokesperson said.

Departures will continue, said the spokesperson, who earlier warned that roads around the airport have suffered major flooding and urged passengers to use public transport.

Airport operations were earlier suspended for 25 minutes before resuming. Unconfirmed images on social media showed planes taxiing across an apron flooded with standing water.

Similar scenes were repeated across Dubai and elsewhere in the UAE as the desert country, better known for its arid climate and intense summer heat, reeled from the storm.

Flagship shopping centres Dubai Mall and Mall of the Emirates both suffered flooding and water was ankle-deep in at least one Dubai Metro station, according to images posted on social media.

Roads and residential communities also suffered heavy flooding and many residents reported leaks from roofs, doors and windows. (AFP)]]>

    Trump trial 'not about his presidency', jurors told

    <![CDATA[Donald Trump's criminal trial on charges stemming from hush money paid to a porn star is not a referendum on his presidency, a prosecutor told prospective jurors on Tuesday in asking whether they could put personal politics aside.

"This case is really not about whether you like Donald Trump. This case is about the rule of law and whether Donald Trump broke it," Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass told the 18 prospective jurors who remained of an initial pool of 96.

Jury selection for the former US president's trial got under way on Monday. He faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. Daniels says she had a sexual encounter with Trump about a decade beforehand.

Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies an encounter took place. The Republican presidential candidate has called the case, brought by Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a partisan witch hunt meant to interfere with his campaign to unseat President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 5 election.

The hush money case is one of four criminal indictments he faces, which stem from alleged mishandling classified information and trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden. He has pleaded not guilty in those cases, which may not go to trial before the election.

The proceedings so far have underscored the challenges of choosing a jury of 12 residents of heavily Democratic Manhattan who can try the case fairly and impartially.

Roughly half of 96 potential jurors summoned on Monday were dismissed after saying they could not impartially judge the polarising businessman-turned-politician.

Six more were excused on Tuesday. They said they had scheduling conflicts, concerns about balancing juror service with their jobs, or had thought further overnight and come to the conclusion they could not be fair.

The jurors allowed to stay on for now after answering questions on Tuesday included an asset manager at Lazard who is originally from Mexico and enjoys scuba diving and skiing, and a corporate lawyer from Oregon who hikes and runs in his spare time and reads the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Trump, wearing a blue tie, at times held a piece of paper up to his face as jurors read out answers to a list of 42 questions. Occasionally he yawned and leaned back in his chair at the defence table. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[A fire ripped through Copenhagen's Old Stock Exchange, one of the Danish capital's most famous landmarks, on Tuesday, engulfing its spire which collapsed in a scene reminiscent of the 2019 blaze at Paris' Notre-Dame Cathedral.

Emergency services, employees from the Danish Chamber of Commerce, including its CEO Brian Mikkelsen, and even passers-by were seen carrying large paintings away from the building in a race to save historic artefacts from the flames.

A video showed the flaming spire breaking in half as it tumbled down, sending a large part crashing to the ground next to a fire truck.

"Everybody is crying at the Danish Chamber of Commerce right now. It's their workplace, but also their history," Mikkelsen told reporters, shaking his head in disbelief.

"It's our cultural heritage that I'm looking at. It's 400 years that have shaped Danish cultural history and the society we live in today."

Denmark's National Museum sent 25 employees to the scene to help evacuate cultural artefacts and paintings, it said on X.

Video from local media showed people sitting on the ground outside the building, looking through paper catalogues listing and depicting the artefacts inside.

"We are saving everything we possibly can," Copenhagen fire department chief Jakob Vedsted Andersen told reporters.

Among the works saved were paintings by Denmark's Peder Severin Kroyer, a renowned 19th century impressionist.

Rescued items would be sent to Denmark's National Museum for examination, its head of collection storage and curation Camilla Jul Bastholm told Reuters.

The historic building, whose spire was shaped as the tails of four dragons intertwined, had been under renovation and clad in scaffolding when the fire broke out.

Parts of the roof had collapsed and the fire spread to several floors of the building, the fire service said, adding the firefighting operation would continue through the night.

There were no reports of injuries, police said, and it was not immediately clear what caused the blaze. (Reuters)]]>
