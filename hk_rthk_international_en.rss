    <![CDATA[Police on Wednesday took back a lecture hall from pro-Palestinian protesters who for hours occupied the building at the University of California, Irvine, then cleared a student encampment that stood for more than two weeks, witnesses said.

Officers from about 10 nearby law-enforcement agencies converged on the campus after university officials requested help because protesters had occupied the lecture hall, leading the school to declare it a "violent protest," police and university officials said.

About four hours later, police had ejected the protesters from both the lecture hall and the plaza that had been the site of the encampment, according to the university and Reuters witnesses.

"The police have retaken the lecture hall," UC Irvine spokesperson Tom Vasich said by telephone from the scene. "The plaza has been cleared by law-enforcement officers."

Vasich said there were a "minimal number of arrests" and characterised the protesters as "begrudgingly cooperative."

The university said all classes would be held remotely on Thursday, asking employees not to come to campus.

The demonstration at Irvine, about 65km south of Los Angeles, is the latest in a series of campus protests across the United States over the war in Gaza in which activists have called for a ceasefire and the protection of civilian lives while demanding universities divest from Israeli interests.

UC Irvine protesters had established an encampment adjacent to the lecture hall on April 29 similar to those at other universities that have led to mass arrests and clashes with police elsewhere in the country.

On Wednesday, 200 to 300 protesters took over the lecture hall at a time when no classes were in session, Vasich said.

Police responded in riot gear and formed a barricade while an officer on a loudspeaker warned the crowd that they had formed an unlawful assembly and risked arrest if they remained, the Orange County Register reported.

Students chanted slogans, banged drums and hoisted banners, with rows of police standing nearby, Reuters witnessed. 

One banner hung from the building declared the site "Alex Odeh Hall," in honor of a Palestinian activist who was killed in a 1985 office bombing in the nearby city of Santa Ana.

Four adjacent research buildings with potentially hundreds of people inside were locked down, and those inside were instructed to shelter in place, Vasich said, though the university later altered that instruction and instead advised them to leave.

Shortly before nightfall, police moved in on the lecture hall, then engaged in a tense standoff with protesters at the encampment.

Helmeted police wielding batons formed a line against protesters. Police gradually moved forward, pushing the students back every few minutes, until the officers rushed the crowd and made more arrests.

Before long most demonstrators had retreated, police held the otherwise empty plaza strewn with trash, and a few onlookers remained at the periphery. (Reuters)]]>

    Canada wildfire doubles in size as thousands flee

    <![CDATA[A wildfire in Canada's major oil-producing region doubled in size as it drew closer to the city of Fort McMurray on Wednesday, but officials were hopeful shifting winds could soon push it away.

The blaze scorched almost 21,000 hectares of forest overnight as it came within 4.5 kilometres of the city, which was partly evacuated the day before.

Alberta Wildfire spokeswoman Christie Tucker told a briefing that cooler temperatures and calmer winds were expected to "push the fire away from Fort McMurray" as well as weaken it.

However, Alberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis urged residents to "remain vigilant," noting that "wildfire conditions can change and deteriorate rapidly."

For many, the fire has brought back terrifying memories of 2016 when a massive blaze gutted Fort McMurray, forcing its entire population of more than 90,000 to flee at a moment's notice.

"I'm sure these memories will create fear and uncertainty for many in Fort McMurray and my sympathy is with everyone facing this situation, but safety must remain our top priority," said Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, after 6,000 residents of four neighborhoods were ordered out on Tuesday.

Many stores and schools were closed as a haze blanketed the city.

Freddy Saulnier, 51, who recently moved to Fort McMurray from New Brunswick on the Atlantic coast, says he is living "a nightmare."

Staying in a hotel room after being ordered to leave his home, he says he can smell the smoke. This fire "is a beast," he said. "It's almost like watching a horror movie, you don't know if the killer is hiding behind a tree, and it's eerily quiet at night."

After being pulled from the front lines the day before, firefighters were back on Wednesday along with water bombers dropping retardant, while heavy equipment operators built fire guards southwest of the town.

Canadian authorities have been bracing for another possibly devastating wildfire season, after the country's worst-ever last year saw flames burning from coast to coast and charring more than 15 million hectares of land. (AFP)]]>

    Biden, Trump to hold first presidential debate in June

    <![CDATA[Joe Biden and Donald Trump agreed on Wednesday to hold a first presidential debate in June after the Democratic incumbent challenged his rival to "make my day" and the scandal-plagued Republican quickly responded he was ready to "rumble."

CNN announced it will hold the first debate on June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia. Biden proposed a second debate for September and Trump accepted.

Biden, 81, had set out his own terms for the debates with political showman Trump, such as time limits for speakers and having no live audience – a condition CNN said it had agreed to.

In his first formal debate offer after months of stalling, the Democrat also shunned the traditional calendar proposed by the commission that has run debates since 1988 as he sought to exercise control over the format.

Trump, 77, accepted the dates even as he set out a starkly different vision with a larger venue for "excitement purposes" and accused the Democrat of being afraid of crowds.

"Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hasn't shown up for a debate. Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal," Biden said in a video on X.

"I'll even do it twice."

Biden also trolled Trump over his ongoing criminal hush money trial in New York, which features a mid-week break, adding: "So let's pick the dates Donald. I hear you're free on Wednesdays."

CNN said in a statement that the debate would be held at its studios in Atlanta in the "crucial battleground state of Georgia."

"To ensure candidates may maximise the time allotted in the debate, no audience will be present. Moderators for the debate and additional details will be announced at a later date," it said.

Biden's debate offer appeared to show him taking the calculated risk of putting Trump back into American living rooms ahead of November's election, hoping it could reverse the Republican's poll lead in a series of battleground states.

The Biden campaign has increasingly been trying to remind voters of what they say is the true face of the mercurial president who lost in 2020, amid what they fear is Trump "nostalgia" in some quarters – even as the Republican details his stark vision for an authoritarian second term in various interviews.

For his part, Trump has previously said he would debate his rival "anytime, anywhere" as he seeks to portray Biden as old and incapable of leadership.

After Biden's challenge, Trump – who avoided any debates with his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination this year – said he was "ready to Rumble!!!" for the proposed June and September debates. (AFP)]]>

    Slovakia PM shot, fighting 'life-threatening' injuries

    <![CDATA[Slovakia Prime Minister Robert Fico was on Wednesday shot multiple times and rushed to hospital with life-threatening injuries after a cabinet meeting, officials said, in an attack condemned by EU chiefs.

Fico, a populist leader accused of being Kremlin-friendly, has been prime minister since last year.

"Today, after the government meeting in Handlova, there was an assassination attempt on the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Robert Fico," the government said in a post on social media.

"He is currently being transported by helicopter to Banska Bystrica in a life-threatening condition, because it would take too long to get to Bratislava due to the necessity of an acute intervention," it said.

Fico was shot multiple times, said a post on his official Facebook page.

"We confirm the attack on the prime minister," police spokesman Matej Neumann said.

Handlova local hospital director Marta Eckhardtova said "Fico was brought into our hospital and he was treated at our vascular surgery clinic."

She was unable to describe his injuries.

The Dennik N daily said its reporter heard several shots fired and then saw security guards lift the premier off the ground and into a car.

The newspaper also reported that police had detained the suspected gunman.

Slovak President Zuzana Caputova said she was "utterly shocked by today's brutal and reckless attack on Slovakia's prime minister... which I condemn in (the) strongest possible terms."

"I wish him a lot of strength in this critical moment and early recovery," she said on X, formerly Twitter.

Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala also called the news of the attack "shocking."

"I hope the prime minister will get well as soon as possible. We must not tolerate violence, it must have no place in society," he said on X.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said: "Robert, my thoughts are with you in this very difficult moment."

As well as his current stint as premier, Fico also headed the government in 2006-10 and 2012-18.

Since he was elected last October, Fico has made a string of remarks that have soured ties between Slovakia and neighbouring Ukraine.

He has notably questioned Ukraine's sovereignty and called for a compromise with Russia.

He also sparked mass protests with controversial changes, including a media law that critics say will undermine the impartiality of public television and radio.

At a press conference following the shooting, MP Lubos Blaha from Fico's Smer party lashed out against his critics.

"You, the liberal media, and progressive politicians are to blame. Robert Fico is fighting for his life because of your hatred," Blaha said. (AFP)]]>

    Indonesia floods kill 67, rescuers search for missing

    <![CDATA[Indonesian rescuers raced on Wednesday to find dozens of people still unaccounted for after flash floods and cold lava flow that inundated neighbourhoods and swept away houses over the weekend left 67people dead.

Hours of torrential rain on Saturday caused mud and rocks to flow into districts near one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, sweeping away dozens of houses and damaging roads and mosques.

The national disaster agency chief Suharyanto on Wednesday said dozens remained missing, with the figure increasing periodically.

Rescuers said many of the retrieved bodies were found in or around nearby rivers after locals were swept away by the deluge of volcanic material, mud and rain that tore through neighbourhoods.

Cold lava, also known as lahar, is volcanic material such as ash, sand and pebbles carried down a volcano's slopes by rain.

Heavy equipment was deployed to clear debris from the areas worst hit by flooding, which has affected transport access in six districts, said Suharyanto, who goes by one name.

More than 3,300 people have been forced to evacuate from affected areas.

To aid the rescue effort, authorities on Wednesday deployed weather modification technology, the term Indonesian officials use for cloud seeding.

In this case, it is being used in a bid to make clouds rain earlier so the rainfall's intensity is weakened by the time it reaches the disaster-struck area.

Indonesia is prone to landslides and floods during the rainy season.

In 2022, about 24,000 people were evacuated and two children were killed in floods on Sumatra island, with environmental campaigners blaming deforestation caused by logging for worsening the disaster.

Trees act as a natural defence against floods, slowing the rate at which water runs down hills and into rivers. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Beijing's "genuine desire" to help resolve the Ukraine crisis, in an interview with Chinese state media published on Wednesday ahead of a two-day visit to the country.

Putin arrives in Beijing on Thursday to meet his "dear friend" Xi Jinping, seeking to win greater support from China for his war effort in Ukraine and isolated economy.

The visit, in which he will also travel to the northeastern city of Harbin for a trade and investment expo, is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and his second in just over six months to China.

"We commend China's approaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine," Putin told the Xinhua state news agency in a Moscow interview, which was also carried in English on the Kremlin website.

"Beijing is well aware of its root causes and global geopolitical significance," Putin said, referring to a 12-point position paper published by China in February 2023 on reaching a political settlement to the crisis.

"The ideas and proposals contained in the document show the genuine desire of our Chinese friends to help stabilise the situation," Putin said. (AFP)]]>

    Biden plans $1 bn in new arms for Israel

    <![CDATA[US President Joe Biden's administration informed Congress on Tuesday of a $1 billion weapons package for Israel, official sources told AFP, a week after threatening to withhold some arms over concerns of a Rafah assault.

The administration informally notified the weapons package to Congress, which will need to approve it, a US official said, while a congressional aide who also requested anonymity said the weapons bought from US weapons makers amounted to around $1 billion.

The weapons would come out of a major $95 billion package recently approved by Congress in defense support for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, and the Biden administration has repeatedly said it planned to go ahead and appropriate the funds through purchases from US manufacturers.

But the deal comes a week after Biden warned he may withhold bombs and artillery shells to Israel if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went ahead in defiance of US warnings with an assault on Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than one million Palestinians have taken shelter after half a year of war.

The Biden administration also confirmed last week that for the first time it had halted a shipment including 2,000-pound bombs, fearing they would be used with devastating risks for civilians in Rafah.

Congress could still block the weapons sale to Israel, with left-leaning members of Biden's Democratic Party outraged by the toll on civilians in the Gaza war.

But the overall package passed despite opposition from the left, with the rival Republican Party almost unanimously in support of arms for Israel.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the new arms package. It said it could potentially include $700 million in tank ammunition and $500 million in tactical vehicles.

The Biden administration, while increasingly critical of Israel, has made clear it will continue to support its ally's security and pointed to US assistance last month in shooting down Iranian drones launched in retaliation for a strike on a diplomatic facility.

"We are continuing to send military assistance, and we will ensure that Israel receives the full amount provided in the supplemental," Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, told reporters on Monday.

"We have paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs because we do not believe they should be dropped in densely populated cities. We are talking to the Israeli government about this," he said.

Since the October 7 Hamas attack that triggered the massive Israeli retaliation, the Biden administration has twice cited emergency needs to avoid the regular 30-day review by Congress of military transfers.

Critics also point out that the Biden administration has sent a regular flow of weapons unknown to the public as they fall below the threshold for congressional notification. (AFP)]]>

    Riots rock France's New Caledonia over voting reform

    <![CDATA[One person was killed, hundreds more were injured, shops were looted and public buildings torched during a second night of rioting in New Caledonia, authorities said on Wednesday, as anger over constitutional reforms from Paris boiled over.

Protests against the reform turned violent Monday night, with shots fired at security forces, vehicles torched and shops looted in the worst unrest the French overseas territory has seen since the 1980s.

In response, authorities deployed a heavy security contingent, imposed a curfew, banned public gatherings and closed the main airport.

"More than 130 arrests have been made and several dozen rioters have been taken into custody and will be brought before the courts," the French High Commission of the Republic in New Caledonia said in a statement early Wednesday morning.

Describing the "serious public disturbances" as ongoing, the High Commission decried widespread looting and torching of businesses and public property, including schools.

It added that classes will remain scrapped until further notice and the main airport shut to commercial flights.

The unrest flared as lawmakers in France debated a bill that would increase the number of people eligible to cast ballots in the territory's provincial elections, a change critics fear could marginalise Indigenous people.

Following lengthy and at times tense debates, the National Assembly in Paris adopted the reform shortly after midnight, by 351 votes to 153.

Afterwards, French President Emmanuel Macron appealed for calm on all sides.

In the Noumea Accord of 1998, France vowed to gradually give more political power to the Pacific island territory of nearly 300,000 people.

Under the agreement, New Caledonia has held three referendums over its ties with France, all rejecting independence. But independence retains support, particularly among the Indigenous Kanak people.

The Noumea Accord has also meant that New Caledonia's voter lists have not been updated since 1998 -- meaning that island residents who arrived from mainland France or elsewhere in the past 25 years do not have the right to take part in provincial polls.

The French government has branded the exclusion of one out of five people from voting as "absurd", while separatists fear that expanding voter lists would benefit pro-France politicians and reduce the weight of the Kanaks. (AFP)]]>

    Hunger striking Thai rights activist dies in detention

    <![CDATA[A Thai rights activist detained on royal defamation charges died on Tuesday while on hunger strike in custody, the kingdom's department of corrections said.

Netiporn Sanae-sangkhom, an activist from the pro-democracy "Thaluwang" group, had been held in pre-trial detention since January.

She was charged under Thailand's tough royal insult laws over a royal motorcade protest in 2020 during the peak of the kingdom's youth-led pro-democracy movement.

Some of the world's strictest lese-majeste laws protect King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family, with each offence carrying a potential 15-year sentence.

The 28-year-old went on hunger strike shortly after detention to protest against the Thai justice system, and was immediately transferred to the medical correctional hospital over health concerns.

According to the statement released by the department of corrections, Netiporn – also known by her nickname "Boong" – suffered from weak legs and arms as well as anaemia.

She refused "minerals and vitamins" given by the hospital, the statement said.

"She had a cardiac arrest on Tuesday morning and wasn't responsive to the treatment, which led her to die peacefully at 11:22 am (0422 GMT)," the statement said.

It added that the hospital will conduct an autopsy to identify the cause of death.

The Southeast Asian regional branch of the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said it was "deeply disturbed" by Netiporn's death.

"We call for transparent & impartial investigation into her death & care. Freedom of expression & peaceful assembly are fundamental rights," the office wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

According to the Human Rights Lawyer Association, there are at least two political prisoners in Thailand who went on hunger strike.

In 2023, two Thai hunger strikers held under royal insult law were given temporary release over health concerns. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Thousands of people took part on Tuesday in an annual march through the ruins of villages that Palestinians were expelled from during the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation.

Wrapped in keffiyeh scarves and waving Palestinian flags, men and women rallied through the abandoned villages of Al-Kassayer and Al-Husha – many holding signs with the names of dozens of other demolished villages their families were displaced from.

"Your Independence Day is our catastrophe," reads the rallying slogan for the protest that took place as Israelis celebrated the 76th anniversary of the proclamation of the State of Israel.

The protest this year was taking place against the backdrop of the ongoing war in Gaza, where fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas has displaced the majority of the population, according to the United Nations.

Among those marching on Tuesday was 88-year-old Abdul Rahman al-Sabah.

He described how members of the Haganah, a Zionist paramilitary group, forced his family out of Al-Kassayer, near the northern city of Haifa, when he was a child.

They "blew up our village, Al-Kassayer, and the village of Al-Husha so that we would not return to them, and they planted mines," he said, his eyes glistening with tears.

The family was displaced to the nearby town of Shefa-Amr.

"But we continued (going back), my mother and I, and groups from the village, because it was harvest season, and we wanted to live and eat," he said.

"We had nothing, and whoever was caught by the Israelis was imprisoned."

Palestinians remember this as the "Nakba", or catastrophe, when around 760,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes during the war that led to the creation of Israel.

The descendants of the 160,000 Palestinians who managed to remain in what became Israel presently number about 1.4 million, around 20 percent of Israel's population. (AFP)]]>

    Georgia passes so-called 'foreign influence' bill

    <![CDATA[Georgia's parliament on Tuesday adopted a controversial "foreign influence" law that has sparked weeks of mass protests against the measure, which Brussels has warned would undermine Tbilisi's European aspirations.

Lawmakers voted 84 to 30 in favour during the third and final reading of the law, which was widely denounced as mirroring repressive Russian legislation used to silence dissent.

The vote came as street protesters skirmished with riot police outside the building in the centre of the capital, where demonstrations have taken place over the last month.

Scuffles had broken out inside the chamber earlier as opposition lawmakers clashed with members of the ruling Georgian Dream party.

Critics say the bill is a symbol of the ex-Soviet republic's drift closer to Russia's orbit over recent years.

Around 2,000 mainly young protesters gathered outside parliament and chanted "no to the Russian law," as news spread that lawmakers had adopted the law.

Tbilisi has seen weeks of mass rallies over the bill that culminated on Saturday, when up to 100,000 people took to the streets in the largest anti-government rally in Georgia's recent history.

The EU has said the law is "incompatible" with Georgia's longstanding bid to join the 27-nation bloc, while Washington has warned its adoption would signal Tbilisi's departure from the Western orbit.

The US Assistant Secretary of State, James O'Brien, on Tuesday met in Tbilisi with Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, whose office said each had "expressed their concerns" over recent developments in Georgia.

UK Secretary of State for Defence, Grant Shapps, labelled the foreign influence law an act of "Russian interference in Georgia."

Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov hit back, accusing the West of "undisguised interference in Georgia's internal affairs."

Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said that he would be travelling on Tuesday to Georgia together with his counterparts from Iceland, Estonia and Latvia to express "our concerns."

Both protesters and the ruling Georgian Dream party have vowed not to back down and fresh rallies have been called.

Some protesters say their ultimate goal is to vote out Georgian Dream, which has been in power since 2012.

The bill requires NGOs and media outlets that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as bodies "pursuing the interests of a foreign power."

Russia has used a similar law to silence public figures and organisations that disagree with or deviate from the Kremlin's views.

The EU on Tuesday repeated its position that the bill undermines Tbilisi's desire to move closer to the bloc.

"EU member countries are very clear that if this law is adopted it will be a serious obstacle for Georgia in its European perspective," said its spokesman, Peter Stano.

Last year, Georgia was granted official EU candidacy, and Brussels is set to decide in December on the formal launch of accession talks – an unlikely prospect after the law's adoption.

Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili, who is at loggerheads with the government, has vowed to veto the law, though Georgian Dream has enough lawmakers in parliament to override her veto.

"This law is taking away my future," 19-year-old protester Anano Plievi said outside parliament.

"I am angry, and proud of all these people at the same time. We are going to keep going towards Europe."

Georgian society is staunchly anti-Kremlin. Georgia's bid for membership of the EU and NATO is enshrined in its constitution and – according to opinion polls – supported by a majority of the population.

NGOs and government critics have reported months of intimidation and harassment in the run-up to the bill being reintroduced in a targeted campaign that has escalated amid the tensions.

Georgian Dream has depicted the protesters as violent mobs, insisted it is committed to joining the EU, and said the bill is aimed at increasing transparency of NGO funding.

The controversy surrounding the bill comes five months before a parliamentary election seen as a crucial democratic test for the Black Sea country. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin would make a two-day state visit to China from May 16 to 17.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced that Putin was coming at the invitation of President Xi Jinping.

The ministry added Putin would meet Xi on Thursday.

The Kremlin also confirmed the trip. 

It said this would be Putin’s first foreign trip since he was sworn in as president and began his fifth term in office.

The Foreign Ministry said Xi would discuss with Putin “cooperation in various fields of bilateral relations...as well as international and regional issues of common concern.”

Analysts have said Russia is increasingly dependent on China since the West hit it with sanctions over its military action in Ukraine.

Beijing has hailed its "no limits" partnership as it enjoys access to vast natural resources, including steady gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline. (Xinhua/Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit meant to reassure Ukrainians of continued American support and flow of weapons as Russia pummels the northeastern Kharkiv region.

Marking his fourth visit to Kyiv since the start of the war in February 2022, Blinken arrived by overnight train from Poland. 

Blinken will aim to reassure Ukrainian officials including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of enduring American support and deliver a speech focused on Ukraine's future.

Kyiv has been on the back foot on the battlefield for months as Russian troops have slowly advanced, mainly in the Donetsk region to the south, taking advantage of Ukraine's shortages of troop manpower and artillery shells. 

Russia's forces hold a significant advantage in manpower and munitions.

On Monday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Washington was trying to accelerate "the tempo of the deliveries" of weapons to Ukraine to help it reverse its disadvantage. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for better relations with South Korea as he met with his counterpart from Seoul during rare talks in Beijing, Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.

The visit by Cho Tae-yul to the capital on Monday and Tuesday is the first visit by a South Korean foreign minister to Beijing in over six years.

Ties between the two countries "have been facing difficulties and challenges", Wang said, according to Xinhua.

He called for the two sides to "understand and respect each other, strengthen communication and exchanges, eliminate misunderstandings and enhance mutual trust", the Xinhua report stated.

He also hoped that Seoul would "properly and prudently" handle Taiwan-related issues and abide by the one-China policy.

Meanwhile, Cho said better ties were in the common interests of both countries and that Seoul was willing to expand mutual trust, according to Xinhua.

Cho also told Wang their countries should work together and "even if there are difficulties, momentum of cooperation should be continued while carefully managing the relations," according to the South Korean foreign ministry.

He added that they could continue to prepare for a summit of the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan in Seoul, planned for the end of May. The leaders of the three countries last met in China in 2019.

The Chinese statement made no mention of the summit.

Wang and Cho also agreed, according to their ministries, that the economic ties of the two countries had been a force in each other's development, and agreed to strengthen their cooperation, including the ensuring of stable supply chains. (AFP/Reuters)]]>

    Fierce fighting rocks Gaza after US warning of anarchy

    <![CDATA[Israel battled Hamas in Gaza on Monday, including in far-southern Rafah, despite US warnings against a full-scale invasion of the crowded city and of the threat from post-war anarchy or insurgency.

Clashes also raged in northern and central Gaza as Israel marked a sombre Memorial Day, followed by Independence Day from Monday night, more than seven months into the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.

Israelis marked a moment's silence and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that "our war of independence is not over yet. It continues even today... We are determined to win this struggle."

AFP correspondents in Gaza reported helicopter strikes and heavy artillery shelling in the east of Rafah, as well as battles in northern Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp and Gaza City's Zeitun neighbourhood.

Israel last week defied a chorus of warnings -- including from top ally Washington which paused a shipment of bombs -- and sent tanks and troops into the east of Rafah to pursue militants.

The city on the Egyptian border had been sheltering 1.4 million Palestinians, according to the United Nations, but Israel's military operation sparked an exodus of nearly 360,000 people from Rafah so far, said the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).

The agency warned that "no place is safe" in the territory, much of which has been reduced to a grey landscape of rubble.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that Washington had not seen any credible Israeli plan to protect civilians in Rafah, and that "we also haven't seen a plan for what happens the day after this war in Gaza ends".

"Israel's on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy and probably refilled by Hamas," he told NBC. (AFP)]]>

    Cohen testifies against former boss in New York

    <![CDATA[Donald Trump's one-time fixer and the star prosecution witness in the former president's historic criminal trial testified on Monday that he lied and bullied for his former boss who looked on silently.

Michael Cohen's testimony followed last week's court proceedings in which adult film star Stormy Daniels gave toe-curling detail about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump which is at the heart of the case.

Trump, 77, is accused of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer Cohen for a hush-money payment to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election, when the story could have proved politically fatal.

Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen if, as a lawyer-fixer for the property tycoon, he lied and bullied people on behalf of Trump.

"Yes... It was what was needed in order to accomplish the task," said Cohen who periodically glanced over at Trump who was slouched in his chair at the defendant's table.

Cohen spent just over 13 months in jail and a year and a half under house arrest after he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for lying to Congress and financial crimes.

In the first weeks of the trial in New York, jurors have heard from witnesses that Cohen was a difficult character who cajoled others to get his way, while the defence counsel have painted him as a pathological liar and convicted criminal.

Cohen testified on Monday that he worked on both personal and corporate issues for Trump, who he claimed did not have an email address for fear of leaving a paper trial that could be used to prosecute him.

Daniels, who claims to have had sex with Trump in 2006, has denied she threatened him if he did not buy her silence for US$130,000, a payment that prosecutors say Trump then covered up.

The trial is taking place six months before the November election, when Trump will try to defeat Democratic President Joe Biden.

During nearly eight hours over two days last week, Daniels walked the jury through the one-night stand she said she had with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament, and then the financial settlement she says ensued.

Trump had sat impassively for much of Daniels's testimony, apparently cursing at times, and railing against proceedings in his comments to reporters as he entered and left the Manhattan courtroom.

Trump has denied having sex with Daniels, and his lawyers asked the judge for a mistrial on the grounds her testimony was "extremely prejudicial" in what is essentially a financial records and election-related case.

Judge Juan Merchan denied two mistrial requests last week.

Merchan has imposed a gag order on Trump prohibiting him from publicly attacking witnesses, and the ex-president -- who has traded insults with Daniels for years, calling her "horseface" and other crude slurs -- has not commented directly on her testimony.

Trump spoke at a rally on a beach in New Jersey on Saturday and condemned the judge as "conflicted" and the prosecutor in the case, Alvin Bragg, as a "radical Democrat."

But he appeared to heed the gag order and avoided naming any witnesses in the case, including Cohen.

In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

He has also been charged in Florida with allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House but that case has been postponed indefinitely. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The world's biggest banks financed fossil fuels to the tune of US$705 billion in 2023, with US and Japanese lenders leading the way, an annual report by climate campaigners said on Monday.

Since the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the top 60 banks have provided a total of US$6.9 trillion to the sector, according to the coalition's 15th annual report titled "Banking on Climate Chaos".

"Financiers and investors of fossil fuels continue to light the flame of the climate crisis," said Tom BK Goldtooth, executive director of Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the report's authors.

Last year's fossil fuel funding was down 9.5 percent from 2022, the report said.

But some banks increased their exposure to climate risk, it said.

JPMorgan was the top financier last year, providing US$41 billion, a 5.4 percent increase from 2022, according to the report.

Japan's Mizuho moved up to second place with US$37 billion, followed by Bank of America at US$33.7 billion.

"As one of the world's largest financiers to both traditional and clean energy companies, we help power today's global economy," said a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson in response.

"We believe our data reflects our activities more comprehensively and accurately than estimates by third parties. Reflecting our strategy of supporting the build-out of zero-carbon power, we set a net-zero aligned Energy Mix target and will disclose a clean energy supply financing ratio." (AFP)]]>

    Rishi Sunak defends beleaguered Tories' track record

    <![CDATA[UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted on Monday that his beleaguered governing Conservative party can win a general election despite polls consistently indicating the opposite, but refused to set a date for the vote.

Sunak mounted a defence of the Tories' 14 years in power and claimed that Britain would be less safe under Keir Starmer's Labour opposition, which is widely tipped to come back to power.

The UK leader said he was "confident" his party would win a fifth consecutive term but conceded that Labour, out of government since 2010, may ultimately inflict defeat.

"I'm clear-eyed enough to admit that, yes, maybe they can depress their way to victory," Sunak said in a speech in central London, accusing Labour of "scaremongering" and "gaslighting".

"But I don't think it will work because at heart we are a nation of optimists," he added, before warning of several dangers himself.

Sunak cited Russia's war in Europe, Iran's firing of missiles in the Middle East and the uncertainty posed by artificial intelligence as threats that needed to be tackled.

He also referred to "authoritarian" states, including and North Korea, Scottish nationalists who want to break away from the United Kingdom and "cancel culture".

"Our country stands at a crossroads," he said.

"I'm convinced that the next few years will be some of the most dangerous, yet most transformational, our country has ever known," Sunak added.

Sunak's speech at the right-wing Policy Exchange think-tank is a clear pre-election pitch to voters, as Labour increasingly puts flesh on the bones of its policies before a manifesto launch.

Its repeated attacks on Starmer also gave an indication of a potentially bitter and personal election battle ahead.

But Sunak refused again to be drawn on when he would call the vote, repeating his well-trodden line that he was aiming for the second half of the year.

He can go to the polls no later than January 2025.

Labour has enjoyed double-digit leads over the Tories in surveys since the disastrous short-lived premiership of Liz Truss that ended in October 2022, and inflicted heavy losses on the Conservatives in local elections earlier this month.

The opposition -- overhauled since Starmer took over in the aftermath of Boris Johnson's election landslide for the Conservatives in 2019 -- has pledged to run the economy responsibly and hopes to match Sunak's recent pledge to raise defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP.

But the prime minister argued that only his party can protect Britons' safety and financial security, even after a decline in defence spending from 2010 to 2016 and the financial meltdown caused by Truss.

"There are storms ahead. The dangers are all too real," said Sunak, a former finance minister.

"But Britain can feel proud again. Britain can feel confident again. Because with bold action and a clear plan, we can and we will create a secure future."

Asked about Sunak's speech, Starmer said security would be the "first priority" of a Labour administration.

He said the choice at the ballot box would be between "a changed Labour Party that puts the country first and party second" and "the chaos and division" of the Conservatives. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[London's Metropolitan Police on Monday said three men were charged with allegedly assisting Hong Kong intelligence services and with foreign interference.

The men have appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged under Britain's National Security Act.

Chi Leung Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, have each been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service. They were not asked to enter any pleas to the charges and will next appear in court on May 24. All three men were granted bail.

Seven men and one woman who were not charged were released from custody, police added.

The Chinese Embassy in the UK said it has made serious representations to UK officials over the matter.

"The Chinese side firmly rejects and strongly condemns the UK’s fabrication of the so-called case and its unwarranted accusation against the HKSAR government," it said in a statement.

The SAR Government said it had "demanded the UK Government to provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter concerned, and the latter's response is awaited".

"The duties of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London are to maintain close liaison with interlocutors in the local government, business, think tanks and various sectors, with a view to enriching bilateral ties in different areas such as trade, investment, arts and culture, enhancing local people and enterprises' knowledge of Hong Kong's unique strengths, and promoting the economic and trade interests of Hong Kong," it said in a statement.

It said it had demanded that London "fairly handle the matter, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office's Office Manager who was alleged to be involved, and ensure that the normal work of the Economic and Trade Office is not affected".

London police said a total of 11 people had been detained earlier this month, nearly all of whom were arrested in the Yorkshire area in northern England.

A police spokesman said, “this investigation remains ongoing, but now that charges have been brought, I urge people not to speculate or comment further in relation to this case.” (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[Millions of Indian citizens across 96 constituencies began casting their ballots on Monday as the country's gigantic, six-week-long election edges past its halfway mark. 

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third straight term with an eye on winning a supermajority in Parliament.

Monday’s polling in the fourth round of multi-phase national elections across nine states and one union territory will be pivotal for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.

Crucial seats in Maharashtra and Bihar states, where the BJP governs in alliances with regional parties, were also up for grabs in this phase.

In Bihar’s Samastipur city, hundreds of voters lined up at a polling station that opened at 7am amid tight security arrangements. Voters said they were concerned about rising food prices, lack of employment and economic development in the state.

Most polls predict a win for Modi and his BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.

The staggered election will run until June 1 and nearly 970 million voters, more than 10 percent of the world’s population, will elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years. 

The votes are scheduled to be counted on June 4. (AP)]]>
