    <![CDATA[The United Nation's human rights chief has voiced concern over heavy-handed steps to remove protesters from university campuses in the United States where pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been taking place.

The statement comes as dozens of helmeted police on Tuesday night marched onto Columbia University in New York City – the epicentre of the student protests – and began evicting a building that had been barricaded by pro-Palestinian student protesters.

“Freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly are fundamental to society – particularly when there is sharp disagreement on major issues,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said in a statement.

It continued by saying that many of the protests have been held without incident and that at a number of locations, they have been dispersed or dismantled by security forces.

Hundreds of students have been arrested, while others face charges or academic sanctions, the statement said, adding that enforcement actions by universities or law enforcement to restrict such expression "need to be carefully scrutinised".

The statement continued by quoting Türk as saying: “I am concerned that some of [the] law enforcement actions across a series of universities appear disproportionate in their impacts."

The demonstrations – the most sweeping and prolonged unrest to rock US college campuses since the Vietnam war protests of the 1960s and 70s – have posed a challenge to university administrators trying to balance free speech rights with complaints that the rallies have veered into anti-Semitism and hate.

The unrest has swept through US higher education institutions like wildfire, with many student protesters erecting tent encampments on campuses from coast to coast.

Footage of police in riot gear summoned at various colleges has been viewed around the world. (Additional reporting by AFP)]]>

    Binance chief Zhao jailed for four months

    <![CDATA[Changpeng Zhao, the former chief executive of Binance, was sentenced on Tuesday to four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US laws against money laundering at the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Once considered the most powerful crypto industry figure, Zhao, known as "CZ," is the second major crypto boss to be sentenced to prison.

The sentence imposed by US District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle was significantly shorter than the three years sought by prosecutors, and below the maximum one and a half years recommended under federal guidelines.

It was also much lighter than the 25 years behind bars that Sam Bankman-Fried received in March for stealing US$8 billion from customers of his now-bankrupt FTX exchange. Bankman-Fried is appealing his conviction and sentence.

Still, prosecutors cheered the outcome of what had been a years-long investigation into Binance and Zhao, a billionaire who had been living beyond US reach in the United Arab Emirates.

"This was an epic day,” US Attorney Tessa Gorman told reporters outside the courthouse. “Incarceration was critical in this case and we’re pleased with the result.”

Before handing down the sentence, Jones faulted Zhao for making Binance's growth and profitability a higher priority than complying with US laws.

"You had the wherewithal, the finance capabilities, and the people power to make sure that every single regulation had to be complied with, and so you failed at that opportunity," he said.

Zhao, 47, did not visibly react upon hearing his sentence.

"'Crime pays' is the message sent today," Dennis Kelleher, head of the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets, wrote in an email, noting Zhao will still get to keep his vast wealth.

Prosecutors said Binance employed a "Wild West" model that welcomed criminals, and did not report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups including Hamas, al-Qaeda and Islamic State.

"I'm sorry," Zhao told the judge before being sentenced. (Reuters)]]>

    Georgia police break up 'foreign agents' law protest

    <![CDATA[Georgian security forces used water cannon, tear gas and stun grenades against protesters outside parliament late on Tuesday, sharply escalating a crackdown after lawmakers debated a "foreign agents" bill which is viewed by the opposition and Western nations as authoritarian and Russian-inspired.

Eyewitnesses said they saw some police officers physically attack protesters, who threw eggs and bottles at them, before using tear gas, water cannon and stun grenades to force demonstrators from the area outside the parliament building.

Levan Khabeishvili, the leader of Georgia's largest opposition party, the United National Movement, posted a picture on X with his face bloodied and sporting a black eye. A party official said Khabeishvili was beaten by police after disappearing from central Tbilisi.

After being dispersed from parliament, around two thousand protesters continued to block Tbilisi's main Rustaveli Avenue, barricading it with cafe tables and rubbish bins. Some shouted "Slaves" and "Russians" at police.

Earlier, riot police used pepper spray and batons to clear some protesters who were trying to prevent lawmakers from leaving the back entrance of parliament.

Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili,  whose powers are mostly ceremonial, said in a post on X the crackdown had been "totally unwarranted, unprovoked and out of proportion," and that the protests had been peaceful.

The bill has heightened divisions in the southern Caucasus country, setting the ruling Georgian Dream party against a protest movement backed by opposition groups, civil society, celebrities and the figurehead president.

Parliament, which is controlled by the Georgian Dream and its allies, is likely to approve the bill, which must pass two more readings before becoming law. Lawmakers ended Tuesday's session without a vote and the debate will resume on Wednesday.

On Monday, a government-organised rally in support of the bill was attended by tens of thousands of people.

At that rally, former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire who founded Georgian Dream, told attendees that a "global party of war" had hijacked the EU and Nato and that it was bent on using those institutions to undermine Georgian sovereignty.

The bill would require organisations receiving more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as "foreign agents". Georgian critics have labelled the bill "the Russian law", comparing it to Moscow's "foreign agent" legislation, which has been used to crack down on dissent there. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Tuesday to launch a ground offensive on the Gaza Strip's far-southern city of Rafah "with or without" a truce deal being agreed with Hamas.

The hawkish premier issued the warning despite strong concerns raised by top ally Washington and hours before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was set to arrive in Israel on his latest Middle East crisis tour.

Netanyahu promised "total victory" and said stopping the war "before achieving all of its goals is out of the question".

"We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there with or without a deal," he told families of some of the hostages still being held in Gaza, his office said.

Netanyahu's comments came as Hamas was weighing the latest plan for a truce proposed in Cairo talks with US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators that had raised cautious hopes for an end to the fighting after nearly seven months.

The Palestinian militant group said it was considering a plan for a 40-day ceasefire and the exchange of scores of hostages for larger numbers of Palestinian prisoners.

Washington has heightened pressure on all sides to reach a ceasefire - a message pushed by Blinken, who was on his seventh regional tour since the war broke out.

As diplomacy continued, Israel kept up its bombardment that has flattened swathes of Gaza.

An AFP correspondent reported air strikes on Gaza City, Khan Yunis and Rafah, while Israel said "fighter jets struck a number of terror targets in central Gaza".

Palestinians in Rafah mourned the latest victims as children were being pulled from the rubble. (AFP)]]>

    Protesters take over Columbia University building

    <![CDATA[Dozens of protesters took over a building at Columbia University in New York early on Tuesday, barricading the entrances and unfurling a Palestinian flag out of a window in the latest escalation of demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war that have spread to US college campuses nationwide.

Video footage showed protesters on Columbia's Manhattan campus locking arms in front of Hamilton Hall and carrying furniture and metal barricades to the building, one of several that was occupied during a 1968 civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protest on the campus. 

Posts on an Instagram page for protest organisers shortly after midnight urged people to protect the encampment and join them at Hamilton Hall.

The student radio station, WKCR-FM, broadcast a play-by-play of the hall’s takeover, which occurred nearly 12 hours after Monday’s 2pm deadline for the protesters to leave an encampment of around 120 tents or face suspension. 

Representatives for the university did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment on Tuesday.

Universities across the US are grappling with how to clear out encampments as commencement ceremonies approach, with some continuing negotiations and others turning to force and ultimatums that have resulted in clashes with police. Dozens of people were arrested on Monday during protests at universities in Texas, Utah and Virginia, while Columbia said hours before the takeover of Hamilton Hall that it had started suspending students.

Demonstrators are sparring over the Israel-Hamas war and its mounting death toll, and the number of arrests at campuses nationwide is approaching 1,000 as the final days of class wrap up. The outcry is forcing colleges to reckon with their financial ties to Israel, as well as their support for free speech. Some Jewish students say the protests have veered into anti-semitism and made them afraid to set foot on campus.

On Monday, student activists at Columbia defied the 2pm deadline to leave the encampment. Instead, hundreds of protesters remained. A handful of counter-demonstrators waved Israeli flags, and one held a sign reading, “Where are the anti-Hamas chants?”

While the university didn’t call police to roust the demonstrators, school spokesperson Ben Chang said suspensions had started but could provide few details. 

Protest organisers said they were not aware of any suspensions as of Monday evening.

Columbia’s handling of the demonstrations also has prompted federal complaints.

A class-action lawsuit on behalf of Jewish students alleges a breach of contract by Columbia, claiming the university failed to maintain a safe learning environment, despite policies and promises. It also challenges the move away from in-person classes and seeks quick court action requiring Columbia to provide security for the students.

Meanwhile, a legal group representing pro-Palestinian students is urging the US Department of Education’s civil rights office to investigate Columbia’s compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for how they have been treated. (AP)]]>

    Indonesia volcano erupts, triggers highest alert

    <![CDATA[Indonesia’s Mount Ruang volcano erupted on Tuesday for a second time in two weeks, spewing ash almost 2 kilometres into the sky, closing an airport and peppering nearby villages with debris.

The alert level of the volcano on Sulawesi Island was again raised to the highest level by the Indonesian geological service, after sensors picked up increasing volcanic activity. 

The agency urged residents and climbers to stay at least 6 kilometres from the volcano’s crater.

The 725-metre volcano in North Sulawesi province is about 95 kilometres northeast of Sam Ratulangi International Airport in Manado, the provincial capital.

The airport was closed on Tuesday morning due to reduced visibility and the dangers posed to aircraft engines by ash, said Ambar Suryoko, head of the regional airport authority.

Ash, grit and rock fell from the sky in towns and cities across the region, including Manado, a city with more than 430,000 people where motorists had to switch on their headlights during daytime.

“It was dark with rocks raining at the post from the eruption,” said Yulius Ramopolii, the head of Mount Ruang monitoring post. “The vibrations were intense and knocked out power, and volcanic earthquakes shook the glass windows and everything around us.”

He said the eruption blocked out the sun and peppered several villages with falling debris. No casualties have been reported, Ramopolii said.

More than 11,000 people had evacuated after the April 17 eruption when authorities warned that a major eruption might collapse part of the volcano into the sea and cause a tsunami that could endanger nearby villages.

Fewer than 3,000 remained at temporary shelters after the government lowered its alert level to the second highest from four levels and reopened the airport after four days.

Indonesia’s geological agency on Tuesday warned people on Tagulandang Island, especially those who live near the coast, of the potential of hot volcanic clouds and a tsunami due to eruptions of material entering the sea or collapse of volcanic dome into the sea.

Ruang is among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia. The country is prone to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” – a series of fault lines stretching from the western coasts of the Americas through Japan and Southeast Asia. (AP)]]>

    HSBC says chief executive Noel Quinn 'to retire'

    <![CDATA[HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn will retire, the bank said on Tuesday, in a surprise departure from the business that he has overhauled in the past five years through a sweeping series of asset sales across the globe.

The bank said it has already launched a formal process to find a successor, with Chief Financial Officer Georges Elhedery likely the leading internal candidate for the job.

At the same time, HSBC reported a 1.8 percent drop in first-quarter profit as it struggles to cope with rising costs from expansion in Asia and amid inflationary pressures.

Pretax profit came in at US$12.7 billion for the quarter ended March versus US$12.9 billion a year earlier.

The results were better than the US$12.6 billion average of analysts' forecasts compiled by HSBC.

The London-headquartered bank also announced US$3 billion worth of share buybacks on top of US$2 billion in share purchases announced in February. 

Speaking during a media call, Quinn said he informed the group's chairman Mark Tucker of his decision last month, saying he wanted to have a better work-life balance after an "intense" five-year period in the top job.

"I would never have dreamed of being the CEO in the bank 37 years ago and it's a privilege. But you also have to look forward and say what's right for you personally, and I did a lot reflecting on that over Christmas, the New Year, and January," he said.

"I think it's right for me, but also think it's right for the bank, it's a natural transition point for the bank," adding he would work hard to ensure a smooth transition for his successor.

Tucker thanked Quinn for his leadership and for his years of work at the bank, and said he and the board fully "support and respect that decision". (Reuters)

The HSBC group chairman also said the board and its nomination committee hoped to name a new chief executive in the second half of this year.

    Nato chief says 'not too late' for Ukraine to win war

    <![CDATA[Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday it was "not too late" for Ukraine to win the war, agreeing with President Volodymyr Zelensky that Kyiv needs more weapons, while Russian forces advance.

Stoltenberg was in Ukraine when Russia claimed the capture of two eastern villages in 24 hours, rushing an advance in the Donetsk region before crucial US weapons reach Kyiv's exhausted forces on the front.

"Ukraine has been outgunned for months, forced to ration its ammunition... But it's not too late for Ukraine to prevail," the Nato secretary general said at a press conference with Zelensky.

He said months-long delays in US military aid to Ukraine had "serious consequences on the battlefield."

Stoltenberg said that "more support is on the way."

"Our allies are looking into what more they can do and I expect new announcements soon. So we are working hard to meet Ukraine's urgent needs," he promised.

Ukraine has been dependent on Western military aid to counter Russia's larger and more powerful army.

Zelensky urged faster deliveries to bolster the front line.

"The Russian army is now trying to take advantage of the situation when we are expecting supplies from our partner," the Ukrainian leader said.

"That is why promptness in supply literally means stabilisation of the front line," he said.

"Together we must disrupt the Russian offensive," he said.

Speaking of the long-awaited aid, Zelensky said "some things have started to arrive" but declined to "go into details."

US President Joe Biden gave final approval for the aid – blocked in Congress for months – last week, saying shipments will start "right away."

On Sunday, Ukraine said the situation was deteriorating for its troops in the eastern Donetsk region. (AFP)]]>

    Dozens killed as dam bursts in flood-hit Kenya

    <![CDATA[At least 46 people including children died when a makeshift dam burst its banks in Kenya's Rift Valley in the early hours of Monday, a local official said, as torrential rains and floods battered the country.

Scores of people have been killed over the March-May wet season in Kenya as heavier than usual rainfall pounds East Africa, compounded by the El Nino weather pattern.

Residents said the accident occurred in the dead of night when the dam burst near the town of Mai Mahiu in Nakuru county, sending torrents of water and mud gushing down a hill and engulfing everything in its path.

The deluge cut off a road, uprooted trees, washed away homes and sent vehicles flying, devastating the village of Kamuchiri.

"We heard what sounded like an earthquake and roars like a moving train," said Margaret Wangechi, a 52-year-old teacher.

Joyce Ncece, chief officer for disaster management in Nakuru County, said on Monday evening that there were 46 bodies at the mortuary, but warned that the number could increase.

The dead included 20 women and 17 children, she said.

Nakuru governor Susan Kihika said 110 people were being treated in hospital.

Rescuers dug through the debris, using hoes and in some cases just their bare hands in a desperate search for survivors.

"We collected some of the bodies held by trees and we don't know how many are under the mud," Stephen Njihia Njoroge, a local resident involved in the emergency efforts, said.

The disaster occurred at Old Kijabe dam, a hillside barrier formed naturally over decades after railway construction work by Kenya's former British colonial rulers.

The Red Cross has set up a desk at a local school to help families find lost loved ones.

Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki said the government had called for inspections of all dams and reservoirs within 24 hours in case there is a need for evacuations.

He also said on X that the authorities would arrest people engaging in "risky behaviour," including motorists attempting dangerous crossings and anyone seeking to transport "passengers across flooded rivers or storm water by unsafe canoes or boats."

His comments came after a crowded boat capsized at the weekend in flooded Tana River county in eastern Kenya.

Kindiki said two bodies had been found and 23 people rescued, and that search and rescue efforts were ongoing.

The Kenyan government spokesman said on Monday that 103 people had lost their lives in floods since March, in a statement that did not mention the dam disaster.

More than 28,000 households have been displaced and over 185,000 people affected, the statement said.

The education ministry announced on Monday it would postpone the reopening of schools following mid-term holidays to May 6 because of the rains.

The weather has also wreaked havoc in neighbouring Tanzania, where at least 155 people have been killed in flooding and landslides. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday he was hopeful Hamas would accept an "extraordinarily generous" offer to halt Israel's Gaza offensive in return for the release of hostages.

"Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel," Blinken said in Riyadh at the World Economic Forum.

"In this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas," he said.

"They have to decide – and they have to decide quickly," Blinken said. "I'm hopeful that they will make the right decision."

"We can have a fundamental change in the dynamic" in more than half-a-year of bloodshed, Blinken said.

A delegation from Hamas was due on Monday in Egypt, which with Qatar has been seeking to broker a deal that would halt the Israeli offensive and see hostages freed.

Blinken also discussed the ceasefire proposal on Monday in Riyadh with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan of Turkey, where Hamas maintains an office and the militants' chief Ismail Haniyeh is a frequent visitor.

Blinken in the talks with Fidan "urged that all efforts be brought to bear to convince Hamas to accept the immediate ceasefire proposal that is on the table," a State Department statement said.

Turkey recognises Israel but President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been a strident critic of its Gaza offensive.

Erdogan has voiced an eagerness for a greater role in mediating the Gaza conflict after Qatar in recent weeks indicated it would take a step back. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday said that after a period of reflection about his future he had decided to continue as the country's leader.

Sanchez said he had informed King Felipe VI of his decision.

His decision to continue draws a line under a week in which Spanish politics was thrown into further turmoil by the prospect of facing another parliamentary vote to choose a new prime minister or even a fourth general election in five years.

Sanchez, 52, surprised both foes and allies alike when he said last Wednesday he was taking several days away from public duty to consider quitting, provoking large demonstrations from his followers in the country over the weekend.

He made his announcement on the same day a court said it would investigate his wife, Begona Gomez, for influence peddling and business corruption, allegations he said were false and orchestrated by his conservative opponents. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday arrived in Riyadh at the start of a new trip to the Middle East aimed at pushing for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and increasing humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.

The top US diplomat will also visit Jordan and Israel on his seventh visit to the region since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel which triggered the Israeli assault on Gaza.

In Saudi Arabia, Blinken was expected hold new talks with the Saudi leadership on potential normalisation of relations with Israel, a US State Department official said.

Saudi Arabia was considering the step -- which would carry massive significance as the kingdom is guardian of Islam's two holiest sites -- before October 7.

The United States has sought to keep up momentum, dangling the prospect of normalisation to encourage moderation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a long-time opponent of Palestinian statehood.

Blinken will also meet in Riyadh with a number of Gulf Arab and European foreign ministers who are visiting for a World Economic Forum meeting and Gulf Cooperation Council talks.

Blinken will discuss "day-after" plans for reconstruction of post-war Gaza, according to the US State Department.

Plans could include funding to rebuild Gaza -- the vast majority of whose people have been displaced -- or support for installing new governance structures.

Blinken arrived hours after US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu spoke by phone about ongoing talks to halt Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for the release of hostages.

Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce between Israel and Hamas for months, as public pressure mounts for a deal. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[At least four people died, including a four-month-old baby, and scores were injured in the state of Oklahoma after dozens of twisters swept the US Southern Plains, while weather alerts on Sunday put more than 7 million Americans under tornado warnings.

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt on Sunday declared a disaster emergency for the state, freeing up more money for first responders and recovery operations.

"Definitely the most damage since I've been governor," Stitt said in Sulphur, one of the hardest-hit communities, as he provided an update on fatalities and damage. 

Stitt began his first term as governor in 2019.

In a call with the Oklahoma governor, President Joe Biden offered the full support of the federal government to help with the recovery efforts, the White House said in a statement.

Storm warnings for high winds, heavy rain and hail also were issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) on Sunday for more than 47 million people stretching from East Texas north through Illinois and Wisconsin.

The NWS reported 38 possible twisters hit the area and that the worst of the storms rolled through Central Oklahoma on Saturday into early Sunday morning, spreading into northwest Texas, western Missouri and Kansas.

The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said area hospitals reported 100 injuries. 

Twisters destroyed or damaged dozens of structures, including the hospital in the town of Marietta, although no injuries were reported there.

More than 20,000 customers in the state remained without power as of Sunday evening, according to officials, as emergency personnel worked to clear roads and repair power lines. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he will host a meeting of state and territory leaders on Wednesday to discuss a coordinated response towards violence against women.

Thousands protested in cities around the country at the weekend to draw attention to the deaths of 27 women so far this year allegedly caused by acts of gender-based violence in a population of 27 million.

Albanese on Monday described domestic violence as a “national crisis”, and said the rallies were a call to action for all levels of Australian government to do more to prevent gender-based violence.

"Quite clearly, we need to do more. It’s not enough to just have empathy,” Albanese told Nine Network television.

"The fact that... a woman dies every four days on average at the hand of a partner is just a national crisis,” he added.

There were 17 rallies held across Australia over the weekend, with an estimated 15,000 people demonstrating in the city of Melbourne.

Albanese, his Women’s Minister Katy Gallagher and Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth received a hostile response when they attended a rally in the capital Canberra on Sunday.

Protesters yelled at the government leaders, “we want action” and “do your job.”

Albanese said there needed to be more focus on perpetrators and prevention of violence. “We need to change the culture, we need to change attitudes, we need to change the legal system,” he told the rally. (AP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Ukraine's army leader admitted on Sunday that Kyiv's position on the battlefield has worsened after Russian forces captured another village in the east, pressing their advantage in manpower and ammunition.

Russia's troops are advancing in the eastern Donetsk region as Kyiv awaits the arrival of much-needed US weapons that it hopes will stabilise the fragile front lines.

"The situation at the front has worsened," Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky said in a Facebook post on Sunday.

Ukrainian troops had "retreated" westwards to new defensive lines in a section of the front that runs past the city of Donetsk, controlled by pro-Russian forces since 2014.

Russia has "a significant advantage in forces and means" and had been able to notch up advances amid "heavy fighting," Syrsky said.

"In some sectors the enemy had tactical success, and in some areas our troops managed to improve the tactical position," he added.

Russia's defence ministry earlier on Sunday claimed its troops had captured the village of Novobakhmutivka in the Donetsk region – around 10 kilometres north of Avdiivka, which they seized in February.

The stark assessment of the picture facing Ukrainian troops comes at the end of week of ups and downs for Kyiv.

The United States finally approved a US$61 billion package of financial aid after months of political wrangling, unlocking much-needed arms for Ukraine's stretched troops.

But on the battlefield Russia chalked up more successes.

Its troops managed to make rapid advances in a narrow column to the northwest of Avdiivka. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[US President Joe Biden spoke with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Sunday and "reviewed ongoing talks" to free hostages taken by Hamas during their October 7 attack on Israel, the White House said.

The two allies "reviewed ongoing talks to secure the release of hostages together with an immediate ceasefire in Gaza," the White House statement said, as diplomatic efforts intensified to reach a long-sought truce in the war-battered region.

The Israeli government has come under intense pressure from its global allies to reach a ceasefire, as well as from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages seized by the Palestinian militant group during the attack that triggered the war.

Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce for months.

Biden and Netanyahu "also discussed increases in the delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza including through preparations to open new northern crossings starting this week," the statement said.

"The President stressed the need for this progress to be sustained and enhanced in full coordination with humanitarian organisations," it said.

With humanitarian agencies sounding ever more dire warnings of a crisis in Gaza, Israel has come under increasing pressure – globally and from the United States specifically – to allow more aid into the territory.

Biden also "reiterated his clear position" on any Israeli assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the statement said.

Netanyahu has vowed to send troops into Rafah, where more than 1.5 million civilians have taken refuge.

The Biden administration, while backing Israel, has repeatedly voiced alarm over the heavy toll on civilians in the Gaza offensive and has pressed Israel to hold off on any Rafah assault. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[An exceptional number of powerful tornadoes have ravaged parts of Oklahoma and nearby Great Plains states in the US, with one small town reportedly hit by two separate tornadoes within hours, authorities said on Sunday.

After 78 tornadoes were reported on Friday, mostly in Nebraska and Iowa, a separate weather system on Saturday brought 35 tornado reports from northern Texas to Missouri, the National Weather Service said.

At least two people, including a four-month-old child, died in the Oklahoma town of Holdenville, according to multiple reports in state and local media, though crews on Sunday were still sifting through the mounds of rubble.

The storms dumped up to 18 centimetres of rain in some places within hours, and meteorologists warned of a continuing danger of extreme weather on Sunday, including flash flooding, hail and more tornadoes.

Videos and images posted on social media showed scores of building flattened in the small town of Sulphur, in south-central Oklahoma, with vehicles smashed or overturned and trees stripped of branches and leaves.

Postal trucks in Sulphur rested precariously atop the nearly unrecognisable wreckage of buildings, one video showed. Rescue crews went house to house and vehicle to vehicle in search of victims or survivors.

"DO NOT COME TO SULPHUR UNLESS YOU ARE A FIRST RESPONDER!!!" the Murray County sheriff's office said in a Facebook post.

A tornado that struck Ardmore, Oklahoma tossed debris up to 6,100 metres high, the Washington Post reported. Then two other tornadoes came close to the town in the ensuing two hours.

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt declared a 30-day state of emergency to expedite aid to 12 of the hardest-hit counties.

More than 50,000 homes in Texas and more than 30,000 in Oklahoma were without power as of late Sunday morning, the poweroutage.us website reported.

The region is known for the frequency and power of the tornadoes that rumble through every spring. But having separate major outbreaks in succeeding days is exceedingly rare, meteorologists said. (AFP)]]>

    Gaza truce effort builds as Hamas heads to Egypt

    <![CDATA[Diplomatic efforts intensified on Sunday to reach a long sought-after truce and hostage-release deal in Gaza, as Hamas said it would travel to mediator Egypt to deliver its response to Israel's latest proposal.

The Israeli government has come under intense pressure to reach a ceasefire from its global allies, as well as from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages seized by Hamas during their October 7 attack that triggered the war.

A Hamas delegation will arrive in Egypt on Monday to deliver the group's response to Israel's new hostage and truce counterproposal, a senior official of the militant group said.

Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.

Hamas has previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire – a condition that Israel has rejected.

However the Axios news website, citing two Israeli officials, reported that Israel's latest proposal includes a willingness to discuss the "restoration of sustainable calm" in Gaza after hostages are released.

It is the first time in the nearly seven-month war that Israeli leaders have suggested they are open to discussing an end to the war, Axios said.

A Hamas source close to the negotiations said that the group "is open to discussing the new proposal positively."

The source added that the group is "keen to reach an agreement that guarantees a permanent ceasefire, the free return of displaced people, an acceptable deal for (prisoner) exchange and ensuring an end to the siege" in Gaza.

The new hopes of a potential truce came as world leaders and humanitarian groups warned that a looming Israeli invasion of the southernmost city of Rafah would lead to massive civilian causalities.

Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas appealed to the US to stop Israel from invading Rafah, which he said would be "the biggest disaster in the history of the Palestinian people." (AFP)]]>

    Nearly 200 detained in US campus protests

    <![CDATA[Police detained nearly 200 people at three US universities on Saturday as they cleared pro-Palestinian encampments, in the latest campus clashes triggered by protests over Israel's war against Hamas.

On the East Coast, police in Boston detained about 100 people while clearing a protest camp at Northeastern University, with social media posts showing security forces in riot gear and officers loading tents onto the back of a truck.

The action was taken after some protesters resorted to "virulent anti-Semitic slurs, including 'Kill the Jews,'" Northeastern University said in a statement on social media platform X.

On the opposite side of the country, Arizona State University police arrested 69 people for trespassing after the group set up an "unauthorised encampment" on campus.

Arizona State officials said a protest group – "most of whom were not ASU students, faculty or staff" – had set up a camp on Friday and then ignored repeated orders to disperse.

And in the US heartland, police at Indiana University arrested 23 people as they cleared a campus protest camp, the Indiana Daily Student newspaper reported.

Police with shields, batons and other riot gear broke through a line of protesters who had linked arms, tackling those who did not move, the paper said.

The campus activists are calling for a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas, as well as for colleges to sever ties with the country and with companies they say profit from the conflict.

The protests have posed a major challenge to university administrators who are trying to balance commitments to free expression with complaints that the rallies have veered into anti-Semitism and hate speech.

Police have carried out large-scale arrests at universities in recent days, at times using chemical irritants and tasers to disperse demonstrators.

In a statement on X, Northeastern said the area on campus where the protests were held was now "fully secured" and "all campus operations have returned to normal."

The school said it made the move after "what began as a student demonstration two days ago was infiltrated by professional organisers with no affiliation to Northeastern."

It added that detained individuals who produced a valid school ID have been released and will face disciplinary proceedings, not legal action.

"Those who refused to disclose their affiliation were arrested," the school said.

Dozens of students remained encamped on Saturday at the University of Pennsylvania, despite the college president ordering disbandment after what he said were "credible reports of harassing and intimidating conduct."

Meanwhile, Columbia University in New York, where the protests originated, was relatively calm. Officials there announced on Friday that they would not be calling police back to campus after more than 100 people were arrested last week.

"To bring back the NYPD at this time would be counterproductive, further inflaming what is happening on campus, and drawing thousands to our doorstep who would threaten our community," school leaders said in a statement, referring to the New York Police Department.

Canada saw its first campus protest camp spring up on Saturday at McGill University. 

The school in Montreal said such encampments, which are not permitted, increase "the potential for escalation and confrontation, as we have seen at some colleges throughout the US."

Hamas militants staged an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that left around 1,170 people dead, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.

Palestinian militants also took roughly 250 people hostage. Israel estimates 129 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,388 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[An ammunition explosion at a base in southwestern Cambodia killed 20 soldiers and wounded several others, Prime Minister Hun Manet said.

Hun Manet said in a Facebook post that he was “deeply shocked” when he received the news of the blast on Saturday afternoon at the base in Kampong Speu province. 

It wasn't immediately clear what caused it.

Images from the scene showed several badly damaged buildings still smoldering, at least one with its roof blown off, and soldiers receiving treatment in a hospital. 

Other photos showed houses with holes in their roofs.

Four buildings – three for storage and one work facility – were destroyed and several military vehicles damaged, Colonel Youeng Sokhon, an army officer at the site, said in a brief report to army chief General Mao Sophan, posted on social media. 

He added that 25 villagers' homes were damaged as well.

Kiripost, an online English language news service, quoted a nearby resident as saying a major explosion occurred at about 2.30pm, followed by smaller blasts for another hour.

Pheng Kimneang was quoted as saying the windows of a factory nearby were shattered, and homes as far as a kilometre (a half-mile) away suffered minor damage. Photos of the base show it in a large field, apparently with no civilian structures close by.

Hun Manet offered condolences to the soldiers’ families and promised the government would pay for their funerals and provide compensation both to those killed and those wounded. (AP)]]>
