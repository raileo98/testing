    Three European nations to recognise Palestine as state

    <![CDATA[Several major European countries on Wednesday announced they would recognise Palestine as a state at the end of the month.

Norway and Spain said they would formally recognise Palestine as a state from May 28 onwards while Ireland also made a similar pledge.

Israel recalled its envoys from Ireland and Norway for "urgent consultations" in response to their decisions.

Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the decision to recognise a Palestinian state undermined Israel's right to self-defence and efforts to return the 128 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza.

The Palestinian Authority and its rival group Hamas both welcomed the recognition of a Palestinian state by the three countries.

Most Western governments, including the United States, say they are willing to one day recognise Palestinian statehood, but not before agreement is reached on thorny issues like its final borders and the status of Jerusalem.

However, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez charged that his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu's campaign of "pain and destruction" in the Gaza Strip was now putting the two-state solution in danger.

Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said "recognition of Palestine is a means of supporting the moderate forces which have been losing ground in this protracted and brutal conflict".

"In the midst of a war, with tens of thousands killed and injured, we must keep alive the only alternative that offers a political solution for Israelis and Palestinians alike: Two states, living side by side, in peace and security."

Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris called the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel "barbaric", but added that "a two-state solution is the only way out of the generational cycles of violence, retaliation and resentment". (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[China said Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing will attend the memorial service of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi who died in a helicopter crash last weekend.

According to the Foreign Ministry, Zhang, as President Xi Jinping's special representative, will attend the service in the capital Tehran.

Meanwhile, huge crowds of Iranians thronged the streets of Tehran on Wednesday for the funeral procession of Raisi and his entourage.

In the city centre, mourners clutching portraits of Raisi gathered in and around the University of Tehran, where Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led the prayers.

Flanked by top officials, Khamenei said prayers over the coffins of the dead, who also included Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.

Raisi's helicopter crashed into a fog-shrouded mountainside in northwestern Iran on Sunday as he headed back to the city of Tabriz after attending a ceremony on the border with Azerbaijan.

A huge search and rescue operation was launched, involving help from Turkey, Russia and the European Union. Iranian state television announced Raisi's death early on Monday.

Raisi, who was widely expected to succeed Khamenei as supreme leader, was 63.

In the capital, huge banners have gone up hailing the late president as "the martyr of service", while others bade "farewell to the servant of the disadvantaged".

Tehran residents received phone messages urging them to "attend the funeral of the martyr of service".

From the university, the coffins will be driven to the huge Enghelab Square in the city centre and on to Azadi Square, state media said.

Funeral rites for Raisi and his entourage began on Tuesday with processions through Tabriz and the Shiite clerical centre of Qom drawing tens of thousands of black-clad mourners.

From Tehran, the bodies will be taken to Iran's second city of Mashhad, Raisi's hometown in the northeast, where he will be buried on Thursday evening after funeral rites at the Imam Reza shrine. (AFP and agencies)

    <![CDATA[Renowned Sherpa mountain guide Kami Rita scaled Mount Everest for a record 30th time on Wednesday, completing his second climb this month to the top of the world.

Rita reached the 8,849-metre summit at 7:49am local time, according to Khim Lal Gautam, a Nepalese government official at Everest base camp.

His first ascent of this year's climbing season was on May 12 guiding foreign clients.

He also climbed Mount Everest twice last year, setting the record for the most climbs of the world's highest mountain on the first and extending it less than a week later.

His closest competitor for the most climbs of Mount Everest is fellow Sherpa guide Pasang Dawa, who has 27 successful ascents of the mountain.

Rita first climbed Everest in 1994 and has been making the trip nearly every year since. 

He is one of many Sherpa guides whose expertise and skills are vital to the safety and success each year of foreign climbers who seek to stand on top of the mountain. (AP)]]>

    Schools, cars burn in N Caledonia before Macron visit

    <![CDATA[Arsonists torched schools and hundreds of cars overnight in New Caledonia, officials said on Wednesday, as French President Emmanuel Macron embarked on a surprise visit aiming to end nine days of deadly riots on the French Pacific archipelago.

Macron left Paris on Tuesday on a flight to the troubled territory, a popular holiday destination where roads are now littered with charred vehicles, and scores of shops, schools and other buildings are in cinders.

Clashes have left six people dead and hundreds injured since unrest erupted on May 13 on the Pacific islands, home to 270,000 people.

French authorities said the violence had eased since 1,050 troops, tactical police and national security reinforcements from Paris were deployed, including to "highly sensitive" areas.

Nevertheless, two primary schools and 300 cars in a dealership were torched in the territory's capital Noumea during the night, the mayor's office said.

The deadliest unrest in four decades has been blamed on French plans to give voting rights to thousands of non-indigenous residents, which Indigenous Kanaks say will dilute their votes.

An official close to the president said Macron aims to "listen to, talk and hold discussions with New Caledonian elected officials" in an attempt to restore order.

He wants to "give answers to the many legitimate questions Caledonians are asking, both on the reconstruction side and the political side", the official added.

But one Kanak manning an unofficial roadblock north of the capital Noumea said Macron needed to understand Indigenous opposition to the vote reform.

"I don't know why our fate is being discussed by people who don't even live here," said the 52-year-old, who gave only his first name Mike. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[China will continue to strengthen strategic cooperation with Iran, safeguard common interests, and make endeavours for regional and world peace, state media reported on Wednesday, citing comments from Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

Wang made the remarks in talks on Tuesday with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahdi Safari, while attending a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

"Iran has lost outstanding leaders and China has lost good friends and partners, said Wang, according to Xinhua News Agency. "In this difficult time, China firmly stands by Iranian friends", he said, referring to the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday.

Safari, for his part, thanked President Xi Jinping and Wang for expressing condolences at the earliest opportunity on the deaths of Raisi and Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and thanked China for its steadfast support for Iran.

He emphasised that Iran's domestic and foreign policies will remain unchanged, and the country will continue to advance the process of national development under the leadership of the supreme leader.

Safari added that Iran attaches great importance to its relationship with China, and is committed to enhancing cooperation in political, economic, cultural and other fields. (Reuters/Xinhua)]]>

    <![CDATA[British police are investigating the unexplained death of a man, who was charged earlier this month for allegedly helping Hong Kong authorities gather intelligence in the United Kingdom.

Matthew Trickett was due to appear in court on Friday to face charges under Britain's National Security Act.

British police said Trickett, who was 37, was found dead in a park in Maidenhead, west of London, on Sunday afternoon after a report from a member of the public.

Police said an investigation was ongoing into the death and an autopsy would be conducted.

Trickett’s lawyer said he was "shocked" by the news and was supporting Trickett's family.

The suspect was a former Royal Marine who'd worked for the UK border force. He was also the director of a security consultancy.

In early May, Trickett was arrested along with Peter Wai and Bill Yuen, the office manager of Hong Kong's Trade Office in London. 

The three men were granted bail and were due to appear in court on Friday. 

When they were charged, the Chinese Embassy in the UK said it made serious representations to UK officials over the matter, saying it firmly rejected and strongly condemned "Britain's fabrication of the so-called case".

The SAR Government, meanwhile, said it had "demanded the UK Government provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter. (Agencies)]]>

    WHO says north Gaza hospitals barely operational

    <![CDATA[North Gaza's last two functioning hospitals, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan, are barely operational, doctors and the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday with the Israel-Hamas war now in its eighth month.

Hospital officials said Israeli forces had fired on the facilities and that snipers had been deployed near one of them.

"Today marks the third day of the siege on Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza," said the hospital's acting director Dr Mohammad Saleh.

He reported that Israeli forces had been "firing at the hospital buildings" and that "snipers" have taken up position in nearby houses.

Dr Saleh said the "southern wall" of the hospital "has been destroyed" and "all medical staff and patients" are inside the hospital wards.

Moving around the hospital was "extremely difficult," he said.

But staff still had to transfer water "from the second building to the first one because the occupation (Israeli) forces hit the first building with a shell on the fifth floor yesterday (Monday), destroying the water tanks."

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference in Geneva that "148 hospital staff, 22 patients and their companions are trapped inside" the hospital.

The WHO regularly visited Al-Awda in April to deliver medical supplies and fuel, but Ghebreyesus also reported snipers aiming at the building and artillery hitting the fifth floor.

Dounia Dekhili, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Gaza, said "nothing is coming in or out" of the hospital because of fears of sniper fire.

"Our operating theatre supervisor has been hiding for a few days, he can hear gunshots," Dekhili said after speaking to the man inside Al-Awda.

Dr Saleh did not report any casualties, but said the episode was reminiscent of the last Israeli military operation in the area of the northern Gaza hospital, which is located next to the Jabalia refugee camp.

In December, Israeli forces besieged Al-Awda for days, killing two staff and detaining others, MSF reported at the time.

The Israeli military has yet to comment on the operation in Al-Awda.

Tuesday also saw patients and staff being evacuated from another north Gaza hospital, Kamal Adwan, said its director Dr Hossam Abu Safia.  

"Currently, the hospital is being evacuated of the wounded, patients, and medical staff," he said, adding that "there are several patients that the medical teams have not been able to evacuate".

He said "the reception and emergency entrance gate of Kamal Adwan Hospital was targeted by an artillery shell from the Israeli army," as soldiers advanced towards the complex.

Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative in the Palestinian Territories, said on Tuesday from Jerusalem that the hospital's intensive care unit reception area had been hit.

"At the moment, 20 health staff and 13 patients remain," Peeperkorn said, adding that "these are ... functional hospitals we cannot afford to lose," referring to both Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda.

"These are the only two functional hospitals remaining in northern Gaza. Ensuring their ability to deliver health services is imperative," Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.

Israeli troops have previously raided other medical facilities in Gaza, including Al-Shifa in Gaza City, the territory's largest hospital, now reduced to rubble after a March operation, the WHO said.

Israel's military accuses Hamas of using hospitals as command centres to plan and launch attacks against its forces, a charge the militant group denies.

The Gaza Strip has been gripped by war since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,647 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory's health ministry. (AFP)]]>

    Trump doesn't testify, defence rests case in trial

    <![CDATA[Donald Trump's defence lawyers rested their case on Tuesday – without the former president following through on a vow to testify – as the judge planned jury deliberations in the historic criminal trial for early next week.

After approximately five weeks, 19 witnesses, reams of documents and sometimes salacious testimony, judgment day in the first ever trial of a former US president was drawing closer.

New York law means the trial has not been shown on television and experts are divided on whether the airing of Trump's dirty laundry is having much of a political impact. However, with a clash against President Joe Biden less than six months away, the looming jury verdict represents a moment of acute peril for the Republican.

Judge Juan Merchan told jurors that closing arguments would take place next Tuesday when each side would make their pitch to the 12 New Yorkers who will ultimately decide Trump's fate.

"I will expect you will begin your deliberations hopefully at some point on Wednesday," Merchan said.

Trump's lawyers have sought to undermine key testimony against the former president, who is accused of illegally covering up hush money paid to a porn star over an alleged encounter that could have derailed his successful 2016 White House bid against Hillary Clinton.

Lawyer Robert Costello was grilled on emails he sent to prosecution star witness Michael Cohen after the FBI raided him in 2018, with Trump's lawyers seeking to undermine Cohen and the prosecution case.

Costello sparred with Merchan on Monday, prompting the magistrate to rebuke him for poor courtroom etiquette. Trump, in one of his regular tirades outside the courtroom, accused Merchan of being a "tyrant" in what he claimed was a "show trial."

Earlier on Monday, both sides asked their final questions of Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and ultra-loyal fixer who eventually turned on his boss.

Cohen recounted last week how he kept Trump informed about US$130,000 paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

Trump's lawyers set out to paint Cohen as a convicted criminal and habitual liar, recalling his time in prison for tax fraud and lying to Congress.

Trump lawyer Todd Blanche also probed Cohen's loyalty to Trump and then to the prosecution, looking to show jurors that Cohen is self-serving.

Blanche vied to goad Cohen, who has a reputation for a short temper that could have hurt him on the stand – but the witness largely maintained his composure.

Cohen's story generally lined up with Daniels and David Pecker, the tabloid boss who said he worked with Trump and Cohen to suppress negative coverage during the Republican's 2016 White House run.

After Blanche finished with him, the prosecution returned for redirect, with prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asking Cohen what the whole experience has meant for him.

"My entire life has been turned upside down," Cohen said, emotion in his voice. "I lost my law licence, my financial security..., my family's happiness... just to name a few."

Throughout the trial, which has upended the political and legal order, Trump has complained his 2024 election campaign for another White House term is being stymied by the weeks-long court proceedings, which he has to attend every day.

He did so again on Monday, complaining to journalists he's "not allowed to have anything to do with politics because I'm sitting in a very freezing cold, dark room for the last four weeks. It's very unfair."

Calling the case politicised, a coterie of leading Republicans have stood in the wings behind him as he gives remarks to reporters outside the courtroom.

The growing list includes several lawmakers eyeing Trump's vice presidential pick, including Ohio Senator JD Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.

Yet despite the palace intrigue and courtroom drama, the charges ultimately hinge on financial records, and whether falsifying them was done with intent to sway the 2016 presidential vote. (AFP)]]>

    UK blood scandal victims to receive payouts this year

    <![CDATA[Victims of a decades-long contaminated blood scandal that has killed about 3,000 people in Britain will start receiving final compensation payments this year, the government announced on Tuesday.

More than 30,000 people, including children, were infected with viruses such as HIV and hepatitis after being given the tainted blood between the 1970s and early 1990s.

Victims are still dying from what has been described as the biggest treatment disaster in the eight-decade history of the state-run National Health Service (NHS).

It follows similar scandals including the wrongful prosecution for fraud of hundreds of UK Post Office workers because of faulty software, and the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which falsely blamed football fans for the tragedy that killed 97.

A bombshell report released on Monday found the tainted blood affair was covered up by successive governments and health officials, and largely could have been avoided.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak issued a "wholehearted and unequivocal" apology and promised compensation for everyone affected.

Updating parliament on those plans on Tuesday, government minister John Glen said victims would receive interim payments of £210,000 (US$267,000) within 90 days, before the final scheme becomes operational.

"Our expectation is that final payments will start before the end of the year," he added.

Glen said there was "no restriction" on the total cost of the package, which according to media reports could total more than £10 billion.

Friends, family members and carers of those infected will also be eligible for compensation, he announced.

Compensation will be paid to the estate of any person who has died from the scandal and money will be distributed either in a lump sum or via regular payments, Glen added.

Victims included those needing blood transfusions for accidents and in surgery, and those suffering from blood disorders such as haemophilia who were treated with donated blood plasma products, as well as the partners of those infected.

Judge Brian Langstaff's report, running to more than 2,500 pages, found a "catalogue of failures" with "catastrophic" consequences for victims and their loved ones.

It concluded that blood donors were not screened properly, the risk of AIDS was downplayed and too many transfusions were also given when they were not necessarily needed.

In some instances, children with bleeding disorders were treated as "objects for research."

When victims were told the truth, sometimes years later, this was sometimes done in "insensitive" and "inappropriate" ways, the report said.

There were even attempts to conceal the scandal, including evidence that officials in the health department destroyed documents in 1993, according to the report.

Sunak's official spokesman told reporters on Tuesday: "We must fundamentally rebalance the system so that we finally address this pattern so familiar from other inquiries like Hillsborough where innocent victims have to fight for decades just to be believed and heard.

"We will work together across government, our health services and civil society to ensure that nothing like this can ever happen in our country again." (AFP)]]>

    1 dead after Singapore Airlines flight hits turbulence

    <![CDATA[One passenger was killed and 30 injured after a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence en route on Tuesday, forcing it to make an emergency landing in Bangkok, officials and the airline said.

"Singapore Airlines offers its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. We deeply apologise for the traumatic experience that our passengers and crew members suffered on this flight," the airline said, adding it was working with Thai authorities to provide all necessary assistance.

One male passenger died, Kittipong Kittikachorn, Director of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport, said. Eighteen people have been hospitalised and 12 are being treated in hospitals, Singapore Airlines said.

It was not immediately possible to reconstruct the incident from publicly available tracking data, but a spokesperson for FlightRadar 24 said it was analysing data at around 3:49 pm Hong Kong time, which shows the plane tilting upwards and return to its cruising altitude over the space of a minute.

A passenger who was on the flight said that the incident involved the sensation of rising then falling.

"Suddenly the aircraft starts tilting up and there was shaking so I started bracing for what was happening, and very suddenly there was a very dramatic drop so everyone seated and not wearing a seatbelt was launched immediately into the ceiling," Dzafran Azmir, a 28-year-old student on board the flight said.

"Some people hit their heads on the baggage cabins overhead and dented it, they hit the places where lights and masks are and broke straight through it," he said.

The spokesperson for FlightRadar 24 said with regard to data showing a drop in height, "our initial thinking is the turbulence event is prior to the standard descent from 37,000 to 31,000 feet. That appears to just be a flight level change in preparation for landing".

The Boeing 777-300ER plane with 211 passengers and 18 crew was headed to Singapore when it made the emergency landing, the airline said.

Singapore news outlet CNA carried blurry pictures supplied by readers that it said appeared to be from the flight. They showed anxious passengers clinging to seats, with oxygen masks hanging from above, personal items strewn across the aisle and rubbish spilled on the floor of the cabin crew area.

Suvarnabhumi airport said the plane requested an emergency landing at 4:35 pm Hong Kong time and landed at 4:51 pm. 

Singapore Airlines, which is widely recognised as one of the world's leading airlines and is a benchmark for much of the industry, has not had any major incidents in recent years.

Singapore Airlines has had seven accidents according to records by the Aviation Safety Network.

Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[The Israeli army said on Monday that the bodies of four hostages retrieved from Gaza last week were found in tunnels under Jabalia, where troops have been engaged in fierce fighting in recent days.

The army said last week it had recovered the bodies of Ron Benjamin, Yitzhak Gelerenter, Shani Louk, and Amit Buskila, all of whom it said had been killed in Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel.

Their remains were recovered "from underground tunnels in Jabalia in northern Gaza," the army said late on Monday in a statement.

During a military operation, Israeli soldiers searched a suspected building in which a tunnel shaft was located, the army said.

"Soldiers then entered the underground tunnel route in a night operation and inside it conducted combat," it said.

During the fighting the soldiers "located the bodies of the hostages and rescued them from the tunnels," the army said.

The four were taken hostage during the attack on the Nova music festival.

Thousands of young people had gathered on October 6 and 7 to dance to electronic music at the event held near Re'im kibbutz close to the Gaza border.

Fighters from Hamas crossed over from Gaza and killed more than 360 people at the festival, Israeli officials have said.

The Nova festival victims accounted for nearly a third of the more than 1,170 people killed in the October 7 attack, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.

Out of the 252 people taken hostage that day, 124 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 37 the army says are dead.

Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 35,562 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.

Since early May the Israeli military has been engaged in renewed street battles in northern and central Gaza.

On Friday, the army said that the fighting in the northern town of Jabalia was "perhaps the fiercest" in over seven months of war. (AFP)]]>

    UK PM 'sorry' for cover-up over infected blood scandal

    <![CDATA[UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday apologised to thousands of people infected with contaminated blood in a decades-long scandal that a damning report concluded was covered up and largely could have been avoided.

More than 30,000 people were infected with viruses such as HIV and hepatitis after being given the tainted blood in Britain between the 1970s and early 1990s, the Infected Blood Inquiry concluded.

Victims included those needing blood transfusions for accidents and in surgery, and those suffering from blood disorders such as haemophilia who were treated with donated blood plasma products, as well as the partners of those infected.

Some 3,000 people died, and more will follow, in what has been described as the biggest treatment disaster in the eight-decade history of the state-run National Health Service (NHS).

"I am truly sorry," Sunak told the House of Commons, calling the findings of the long-awaited report "a day of shame for the British state."

"Time and again people in positions of power and trust had the chance to stop the transmission of those infections and failed to do so," he added, promising "whatever it costs" to compensate victims.

The total figure is expected to be above £10 billion (US$12 billion) when the government announces the package on Tuesday.

The report, running to more than 2,500 pages, laid bare a "catalogue of failures" with "catastrophic" consequences for victims and their loved ones.

In some instances, children with bleeding disorders were treated as "objects for research."

At one school where 122 pupils with haemophilia were given infected blood products between 1970 and 1987, only 30 now survive, the report said.

"I have to report that it could largely, though not entirely, have been avoided," concluded its author, judge Brian Langstaff.

His team found that successive governments and health professionals failed to mitigate risks despite it being apparent by the early 1980s that the cause of AIDS could be transmitted by blood.

Blood donors were not screened properly and blood products were imported from abroad, including from the United States where drug users and prisoners were used for donations.

Too many transfusions were also given when they were not necessarily needed, the report added.

There were even attempts to conceal the scandal, including evidence that officials in the health department destroyed documents in 1993.

"Viewing the response of the NHS and of government overall, the answer to the question, 'Was there a cover-up?' is that there has been," the report stated.

"Not in the sense of a handful of people plotting in an orchestrated conspiracy to mislead, but in a way that was more subtle, more pervasive and more chilling in its implications.

"In this way there has been a hiding of much of the truth," it added.

On top of the 3,000 patients who died, many more were left with lifelong health problems.

Langstaff said that "the scale of what happened is horrifying" and said people's suffering had been compounded by repeated denials and false assurances that they had received good treatment.

When victims were told the truth, sometimes years later, this was sometimes done in "insensitive" and "inappropriate" ways.

"What I have found is that disaster was no accident. People put their trust in doctors and the government to keep them safe and that trust was betrayed," Langstaff told reporters.

Former prime minister Theresa May launched the inquiry – one of the country's largest – in 2017.

Campaigners hailed the report as the culmination of a decades-long struggle but noted that it came too late for many of the victims who will never see justice.

Andy Evans, chairman of the Tainted Blood campaign group, described the report as "momentous" and that he felt "validated and vindicated."

"We have been gaslit for generations... Sometimes we felt like we were shouting into the wind during the last 40 years," he told reporters. (AFP)]]>

    Trump trial resumes, with closing arguments next week

    <![CDATA[Donald Trump's trial on charges of covering up hush money payments to a porn star approached its final stages on Monday, with closing arguments expected early next week.

Due to an upcoming holiday weekend as well as legal squabbles over jury instructions among other yet undisclosed "issues," Judge Juan Merchan told the court "it's become apparent that we are not going to be able to sum up tomorrow" as he had hoped.

It's still unclear if the defence will present a case – they are not required to – or whether Trump himself will testify.

Most experts say it is highly unlikely he will take the stand in his watershed criminal trial, the first ever of a former US president, as it would expose him to unnecessary legal jeopardy and forensic cross-examination by prosecutors.

But Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche has raised the prospect his client could step up as a witness, telling the judge last week "that's another decision we need to consider."

Before the prosecution can rest, defence lawyers will first conclude grilling the state's star witness, Michael Cohen.

Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer turned tormentor, recounted last week how he kept Trump informed about US$130,000 paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

Over several days of questioning that continued on Monday, Trump's lawyers have set out to paint Cohen as a convicted criminal and habitual liar, recalling his time in prison for tax fraud and lying to Congress.

Blanche has also probed Cohen's loyalty both past and present, to Trump and the prosecution respectively, looking to show jurors that the former fixer is self-serving and willing to go to great lengths to accomplish his aims.

Cohen has said repeatedly he takes "responsibility" for his actions and has faced the consequences. Prior to the trial, including in his books, he had done little to hide his contempt for his former boss.

Blanche has striven to ruffle Cohen, who has a reputation for a temper that could hurt him on the stand – but the witness has stayed largely composed and on topic.

Cohen's story has generally lined up with Daniels and David Pecker, the tabloid boss who said he worked with Trump and Cohen to suppress negative coverage during the Republican's 2016 White House run. (AFP)]]>

    WikiLeaks founder Assange stalls extradition to US

    <![CDATA[WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Monday won a legal bid to appeal against his extradition from Britain to the United States on espionage charges.

High Court judges Victoria Sharp and Jeremy Johnson said Assange had grounds to challenge the UK government’s extradition order. 

Assange faces 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse over his website’s publication of a trove of classified US documents almost 15 years ago.

The Australian has spent the last five years in a British high-security prison after taking refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for seven years.
 
Lawyers for Assange argued Monday the US provided “blatantly inadequate” assurances the WikiLeaks founder would have free press protections if extradited to America to face espionage charges.

Lawyer Edward Fitzgerald said prosecutors had failed to guarantee that Assange, who is an Australian citizen and claims protections as a journalist for publishing US classified information, could rely on press protections of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. (AP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on Monday said he was seeking arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in connection with their actions during the war in Gaza.

Karim Khan said that he believes Netanyahu, his defence minister Yoav Gallant and three Hamas leaders — Yehya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh — were responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel.

Speaking of the Israeli actions, Khan said in a statement that “the effects of the use of starvation as a method of warfare, together with other attacks and collective punishment against the civilian population of Gaza are acute, visible and widely known...they include malnutrition, dehydration, profound suffering and an increasing number of deaths among the Palestinian population, including babies, other children, and women.”

Of the Hamas actions on October 7, he said he saw for himself "the devastating scenes of these attacks and the profound impact of the unconscionable crimes charged in the applications filed today. Speaking with survivors, I heard how the love within a family, the deepest bonds between a parent and a child, were contorted to inflict unfathomable pain through calculated cruelty and extreme callousness. These acts demand accountability.” (AP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Iranian state media on Monday said President Ebrahim Raisi died after his helicopter crashed in a mountainous region of the country.

Rescue teams had been scouring the area since Sunday afternoon after a helicopter carrying Raisi, the foreign minister and other officials had gone missing.

Early Monday, relief workers located the missing helicopter, with state TV saying the president had died.

"The servant of Iranian nation, Ayatollah Ebrahim Raisi has achieved the highest level of martyrdom whilst serving the people," state television said on Monday, with Mehr news agency also saying he was dead.

State television broadcast photos of Raisi, with the voice of a man reciting the Koran playing in the background.

Iran's vice president for executive affairs Mohsen Mansouri posted on X a Koranic verse used to express condolences.

Rescue teams had fought blizzards and difficult terrain through the night to reach the wreckage in East Azerbaijan province in the early hours of Monday.

A Turkish drone had identified a source of heat suspected to be the helicopter's wreckage and had shared the coordinates of the possible crash site with Iranian authorities, Anadolu news agency said earlier on X. Iranian state news agency IRNA said Raisi was flying in a US-made Bell 212 helicopter.

China had earlier said it was "deeply concerned" about Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi after his helicopter went down.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.

The chief of staff of Iran's army ordered all resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guards to be put to use in search and rescue operations.

Earlier, the national broadcaster had stopped all regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country. (Agencies)

    Spain pulls ambassador over Milei speech row

    <![CDATA[Spain recalled its ambassador to Buenos Aires for consultations on Sunday after Argentina's President Javier Milei made derogatory comments about Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's wife during a far-right rally in Madrid.

Milei had called Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez "corrupt" during a rally in Madrid organised by the far-right Vox party and attended by many of its international allies.

Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said he expected an apology from Milei.

Other ministers also condemned Milei's speech, in which he described socialism as "cursed and carcinogenic". Sanchez leads Spain's Socialist Party.

"With his behaviour, Milei has brought the relationship between Spain and Argentina to its most serious state in recent history," Albares said in a video statement.

Milei's visit broke with diplomatic protocol as he refused to meet Spain's King Felipe and Sanchez, instead preferring to promote his book alongside Vox leader Santiago Abascal at the party rally.

The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in a post on social messaging app X that "attacks against family members of political leaders have no place in our culture".

Spain's main opposition party, the conservative People's Party (PP), refused to support Madrid's stance, with party sources saying that Sanchez should have provided explanations about the alleged corruption case weeks ago.

A city court said in April it was looking into accusations of influence peddling and business corruption against Sanchez's wife, brought in a private complaint by Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, an anti-corruption activist group.

However, Madrid's prosecuting authority later said it was appealing to have the case thrown out for lack of evidence. Sanchez decided to stay in office after five days of weighing his future once the probe against his wife was announced. (Reuters)]]>

    Bezos' Blue Origin launches first flight since 2022

    <![CDATA[Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin launched a six-person crew – including the first US Black astronaut candidate from the 1960s – from West Texas to the edge of space on Sunday, resuming its centerpiece space tourism business for the first time since its suborbital New Shepard rocket was grounded in 2022.

"I am ecstatic," Ed Dwight, who at age 90 years and eight months became the oldest person in space, said upon landing.

Dwight and the other passengers, seated in a gumdrop-shaped capsule atop the rocket, were launched from Blue Origin facilities near the remote desert town of Van Horn. The rocket separated from the capsule, which then ascended further beyond the boundary of Earth's atmosphere to 105.7km, while the booster returned to land as planned.

The capsule then returned to Earth under parachutes, capping a mission lasting roughly 10 minutes. One of the capsule's three parachutes did not fully inflate, a hitch that may draw scrutiny before the rocket's next flight.

Dwight was the first Black astronaut candidate who was picked by former US President John Kennedy in 1961 to train as an astronaut, but until now had never flown to space. Dwight stepped out of the capsule once it landed and thrust his fists into the air in celebration.

"I thought I really didn't need this in my life, but now I need it in my life," Dwight told a Blue Origin interviewer upon landing.

Blue Origin has now flown 37 private astronauts, including in 2021 "Star Trek" star William Shatner, who was 90 years and six months old at the time.

The passengers, also including a venture capitalist and a pilot, were paying customers of Blue Origin's space tourism business, though Dwight's seat was sponsored by a space-focused nonprofit and a private foundation. Blue Origin has not disclosed how much it charges customers.

The grounding of New Shepard, Blue Origin's only active rocket, came after a mid-flight failure in September 2022 during an uncrewed research mission. A structural failure in the rocket's engine nozzle, the company concluded, forced the capsule full of science experiments to abort. (Reuters)]]>

    Iran leader's helicopter crashes; fog hampers rescue

    <![CDATA[A helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his foreign minister crashed on Sunday as it was crossing mountain terrain in heavy fog, an Iranian official told Reuters, and rescuers were struggling to reach the site of the incident.

The official said the lives of Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian were "at risk following the helicopter crash", which happened on the way back from a visit to the border with Azerbaijan in Iran's northwest.

"We are still hopeful but information coming from the crash site is very concerning," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

State TV quoted an official as saying that at least one passenger and one crew member had been in contact with rescuers. It also said the helicopter had been found, though Iran's Red Crescent denied this report.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.

Iranian state media said bad weather was the cause of the crash and was complicating rescue efforts. The chief of staff of Iran's army ordered all the resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guard to be put to use in search and rescue operations.

"It is dark and it has started raining, but the search continues. Rescue teams have reached the area ... however, the rain has created mud, making the search difficult," a local reporter told state TV.

The national broadcaster had earlier stopped all its regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country and, in a corner of the screen, live coverage of rescue teams deployed on foot in the mountainous area in heavy fog.

The rescue teams were expected to reach the probable site of the crash later on Sunday evening.

Neighbouring countries expressed concern and offered assistance in any rescue. The European Union offered emergency satellite mapping technology to help Iran with the search.

    <![CDATA[Peaceful dialogue is the only way to address the concerns of students protesting around the world in solidarity with the people of Gaza amid the war between Israel and Hamas, a US economist and Columbia University scholar said.

Professor Jeffrey Sachs made the remarks after pro-Palestinian protests that first began at Columbia University in New York City spread across some 140 campuses in the US, and subsequently reached Europe, Australia and India.

There have been calls to stop the war and for universities to divest and cut ties with Israel.

"These are protests against an ongoing brutal war that Israel is waging in Gaza. And I think the protests in one form or another are going to continue and perhaps intensify if this war continues this way. So students are just seeing injustice and cruelty, and they are responding to it," Sachs told RTHK. 

He said while different schools have handled the protests in different ways, the use of violence to clamp down on demonstrators will only make matters worse.

"Some universities responded very calmly, discussed with the students, the students appreciated the discussions, and the crisis was averted," he said.

"In other cases, the universities called in the police right away. And this escalated the tensions, and I think did unnecessary damage."

The scholar highlighted the importance for school administrators to listen to the students and set up designated areas for demonstrations. 

"Students want respect. They're open for discussion. Administrators are right to keep the universities properly functioning, but that leaves a lot of room for peaceful discussion, deliberation and agreements," he said.]]>
