    Israel qualifies for Eurovision final amid protest

    <![CDATA[Israel qualified for this weekend's Eurovision song contest grand finale as thousands of demonstrators marched through Sweden's Malmo on Thursday to protest its participation over the Gaza war.

Singer Eden Golan performed her song "Hurricane" in Thursday's second semi-final without incident in front of 9,000 spectators at the Malmo Arena and booked her place in Saturday's final after a televote.

Earlier in the day, more than 10,000 people including climate activist Greta Thunberg gathered in Malmo's main square before marching through the southern city's central pedestrian shopping street, according to police estimates.

"I am a Eurovision fan and it breaks my heart, but I'm boycotting," 30-year-old protester Hilda, who did not want to provide her surname, told AFP.

"I can't have fun knowing that Israel is there participating when all those kids are dying. I think it's just wrong."

Alongside signs that read: "Liberate Palestine", banners that said "EUR legitimises genocide" and "colonialism cannot be washed in pink" could be seen in the crowd.

About 50 protesters made it to the front of the Malmo Arena, where the event is taking place, before being dispersed by a heavy police presence.

Protesters also entered the Eurovision Village, where spectators can follow the concert on large screens.

In a different neighbourhood, about 100 counter-protesters gathered under police protection to express their support for Israel.

Earlier on Thursday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday wished Golan good luck and said she had "already won" by enduring the protests that he called a "horrible wave of anti-Semitism".

In 2022, Russia's state broadcaster was excluded from the European Broadcasting Union, which oversees Eurovision, in the wake of the war in Ukraine.

"I feel like if they can remove Russia why can they not do it to Israel?" said protester Marwo Mustafa.

"Hurricane" has already been partially re-written and given a new title after Eurovision organisers deemed the original version to be too political.

Since the beginning of the year, several petitions have demanded Israel's exclusion from the 68th edition of the annual music competition, which opened with the first semi-final on Tuesday.

At the end of March, contestants from nine countries, including Swiss favourite Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire.

Protester Cecilia Brudell told AFP: "At six and nine, my children are now at an age where they want to watch Eurovision but this year we are completely boycotting it." (AFP)]]>

    First faculty-led Gaza protest encampment set up in NY

    <![CDATA[Faculty members of The New School, a private university in New York, on Wednesday set up a pro-Palestine encampment in the lobby of the campus building near Union Square in what’s reportedly the first faculty-led protest in the United States.

The New School Free Press reported that protesting staff are calling for measures such as divestment from weapons manufacturing companies, dismissal of charges against student protesters and the removal of New York police on campus.

About 20 professors occupied the lobby with tents and banners reading "Faculty Against Genocide." 

The staff at The New School named their encampment after Refaat Alareer, a Palestinian poet and professor, who was killed in an airstrike in December 2023.

This comes almost a week after after police cleared an earlier encampment and arrested around 40 students who were subsequently suspended from the New School.

Tensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the United States, with more than 2,500 people arrested.

Some colleges cracked down immediately, while others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in the police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.

In Boston, police detained several people on Thursday at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after demonstrators blocked a parking garage in their ongoing protest movement connected to the Israel-Hamas war.

Protesters have been asking administrators to end all research contracts with Israel’s Ministry of Defense, which they estimate total US$11 million since 2015.

On Thursday, the school issued an alert just before 2 pm local time, saying protesters were blocking the entrance to a campus parking garage and spilling onto a nearby street.

About two hours later, authorities split protesters up and pushed them away from the garage. At least three people were detained.

Protesters walked away continuing to chant “free Palestine.” 

MIT officials said later Thursday that fewer than 10 people were arrested by MIT police during the incident and the Stata Garage and Vassar Street were reopened.

Hannah Didehbani, an MIT student and one of the leaders of the protest, said the decision to block the garage was part of a larger effort to bring attention to what she described as MIT’s complicity with the Israeli military.

Didehbani said she has been issued a suspension and an eviction notice by the school but said MIT cannot suspend the larger student movement.

“They’d much rather do those things than cut ties to a state that is currently enacting a genocide,” she said. (Xinhua, AP)]]>

    TikTok says will label AI-made videos automatically

    <![CDATA[TikTok on Thursday said it will begin labelling AI-generated content automatically from several platforms, including OpenAI's Dall-E and the company's own tools and generators.

Authentication has become a major concern in the fast development of AI, with authorities worried about the proliferation of deepfakes that could disrupt society.

"AI-generated content is an incredible creative outlet, but transparency for viewers is critical," said Adam Presser, Head of Trust & Safety at TikTok.

The automatic labelling of AI-generated or edited content would be a first for social media platforms.

TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, said it would begin testing a label "that we eventually plan to apply automatically to content that we detect was edited or created with AI."

The company told the Financial Times that this will include content made using Adobe's Firefly tool, TikTok's own AI image generators and OpenAI's Dall-E.

It also said it was joining a coalition of technology and media groups, led by Adobe, that incorporate industry-wide labelling into AI-generated products, sometimes called watermarking.

The technology from the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (or C2PA) sets a technical standard to better flag and identify the provenance of AI-generated content.

"By partnering with peers to label content across platforms, we're making it easy for creators to responsibly explore AI-generated content, while continuing to deter the harmful or misleading AI generated content that is prohibited on TikTok," Presser said.

TikTok said that the auto-labelling will be gradual at first, but as more platforms mark their AI-generated content according to the C2PA standard "we'll be able to label more content."

OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence company behind the popular image generator Dall-E and ChatGPT, on Tuesday also joined the initiative and announced the launch of a tool aimed at detecting whether digital images have been created by AI. (AFP)]]>

    Israel says Biden threat to stop arms 'disappointing'

    <![CDATA[A top Israeli official criticised US President Joe Biden on Thursday for threatening to stop certain arms supplies to Israel if it invades the crowded Gaza city of Rafah.

"This is a difficult and very disappointing statement to hear from a president to whom we have been grateful since the beginning of the war," Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, said on public radio in Israel's first reaction to Biden's warning.

Israel has defied international objections by sending in tanks and conducting "targeted raids" in the eastern areas of Rafah.

It says Rafah is home to Hamas's last remaining battalions but the city on the border with Egypt is also crammed with displaced Palestinian civilians.

"If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used... to deal with the cities," Biden told CNN, in his starkest warning to Israel since the start of the war.

"Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs," Biden said. "It's just wrong."

Erdan said Biden's comments would be seen by Israel's foes Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah as "something that gives them hope to succeed."

"If Israel is restricted from entering an area as important and central as Rafah where there are thousands of terrorists, hostages and leaders of Hamas, how exactly are we supposed to achieve our goals?" he said. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping on Thursday said the China-Hungary relationship is now at its best in history.
 
Speaking at a meeting with his Hungarian counterpart Tamas Sulyok at the Sandor Palace in Budapest, Xi said the friendship between the two nations had taken deep roots among the people, and cooperation in various fields had yielded fruitful outcomes. 

Xi also expressed his readiness to foster a good working relationship and friendship with Sulyok, increase exchanges and communication on matters of mutual interest, and jointly promote the high-level development of bilateral relations.

Hungary and China, which mark their 75th year of diplomatic relations, were also expected to sign at least 16 new cooperation agreements, one of which could be a large-scale infrastructure project linked to the Belt and Road Initiative.

Xi arrived in Budapest late on Wednesday after visiting France and Serbia. It is the last stop on his three-nation tour of Europe. (Xinhua/Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol on Thursday said his government's efforts to improve people's lives had fallen short, conceding his ruling party's crushing election defeat last month reflected voters' assessment of his two years in office.

In his first press conference in 21 months, Yoon pledged to focus on improving the economy and tackling what he called the national emergency of flagging birth rates over the three years he has left in office.

"I think the important thing going forward is indeed the economy," he said.

"Corporate growth and job creation are important too but what I think is more important is to try harder to look for what is inconvenient in the life of each and every person and to resolve them."

South Korea's economy beat most forecasts to grow 1.3 percent in the first three months of this year, but living costs have remained stubbornly high, despite some progress in tackling inflation.

In a new policy push, a government ministry would be set up to tackle the record low birth rate and fast-ageing population, Yoon said in opening remarks from his office, behind a plaque reading "The Buck Stops Here."

South Korea's fertility rate, already the world's lowest, maintained its dramatic decline in 2023, as women cited concerns about bearing most of the burden for raising children, lost career opportunities, and the financial cost of raising kids as reasons to delay childbirth or to not have babies.

    <![CDATA[Students at Ireland's Trinity College Dublin (TCD) on Wednesday ended a five-day protest against Israel's actions in Gaza after they said their demands were met by the university.

In a statement posted on its website, the university said "an agreement was reached" after "successful talks between the university's senior management and the protesters".

Laszlo Molnarfi, president of the institution's student union, said TCD's statement was a "testament to grassroots student-staff power".

TCD said the university "will complete a divestment from investments in Israeli companies that have activities in the occupied Palestinian Territory and appear on the UN blacklist in this regard."

Protesters had demanded the university end any relationships it had with Israel.

Security staff had closed the campus gates -- which are usually open to the public -- during the protest.

Student activists began their action last Friday as a "solidarity encampment with Palestine" echoing similar protests in the United States. 

Pro-Palestinian protests have rocked US campuses for weeks, spreading to countries in Europe as well as Australia. (AFP)]]>

    Biden warns Israel US will stop weapons supply

    <![CDATA[President Joe Biden on Wednesday publicly warned Israel for the first time that the US would stop supplying it weapons if Israeli forces make a major invasion of Rafah, a refugee-packed city in southern Gaza.

“I made it clear that if they go into Rafah ... I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah,” Biden said in an interview with CNN.

The American leader's comments represent his strongest public language to date in his effort to deter an Israeli assault on Rafah while underscoring a growing rift between the US and Israel.

Biden acknowledged US weapons had been used by Israeli forces to kill civilians in Gaza, where the Jewish state has mounted a seven-month-old offensive aimed at destroying Hamas following its October 7 attack on Israel that killed more than 1,000 people. 

Israel's campaign has so far killed at least 30,000 Palestinians, many of them civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

"Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centres," he said when asked about 2,000-pound bombs sent to Israel.

Israel's UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan, earlier this week called Washington's decision to delay shipments "very disappointing" although he did not believe the US would stop supplying arms to Israel.

Israel this week attacked Rafah, where more than one million Palestinians have sought refuge, but Biden said he did not consider Israel’s strikes a full-scale invasion because they have not struck “population centres.” (Reuters)]]>

    Brazil flooding death toll reaches 100

    <![CDATA[The death toll from devastating floods that have ravaged southern Brazil for days reached 100 on Wednesday, authorities said, as the search continued for dozens of people still missing.

Nearly 400 municipalities have been affected by the worst natural calamity ever to hit the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with hundreds of people injured and 160,000 forced from their homes.

Many have no access to drinking water or electricity – or even the means to call for help with telephone and internet services down in many places.

On Tuesday, state governor Eduardo Leite had warned the human toll was likely to rise as "the emergency is continuing to develop" in the state capital of Porto Alegre and other cities and towns.

Some 15,000 soldiers, firefighters, police and volunteers were at work across the state, many in boats, and even jet skis, to rescue those trapped and transport aid.

Authorities urged people not to return to affected areas due to possible landslide and health hazards.

Many people are loathe to leave their homes for the safety of shelters amid reports of abandoned properties being looted.

"Contaminated water can transmit diseases," civil defence spokeswoman Sabrina Ribas warned on Wednesday.

The National Confederation of Municipalities said nearly 100,000 homes had been damaged or destroyed by unprecedented rains and floods in the state, with losses estimated at about 4.6 billion reais (more than US$900 million.)

Porto Alegre is home to about 1.4 million people and the larger metropolitan area has more than double that number.

The state's Guaiba River, which runs through Porto Alegre, reached historic levels and five dams are at risk of rupturing. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Hospitals in the southern Gaza Strip have only three days of fuel left, the head of the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday, due to closed border crossings.

Despite international objections, Israel sent tanks into the overcrowded southern city of Rafah on Tuesday and seized the nearby crossing into Egypt that is the main conduit for aid into the besieged Palestinian territory.

"The closure of the border crossing continues to prevent the UN from bringing fuel. Without fuel all humanitarian operations will stop. Border closures are also impeding delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly Twitter.

"Hospitals in the south of Gaza only have three days of fuel left, which means services may soon come to a halt."

Tedros said Al-Najjar, one of the three hospitals in Rafah, was no longer functioning due to the ongoing hostilities in the vicinity and the military operation in Rafah.

"At a time when fragile humanitarian operations urgently require expansion, the Rafah military operation is further limiting our ability to reach thousands of people who have been living in dire conditions without adequate food, sanitation, health services and security," he said.

"This must stop now."

The Geneva-based WHO is the UN's health agency.

Israel bombarded Rafah on Wednesday as talks resumed in Cairo aimed at agreeing the terms of a truce in the seven-month war.

Gaza's bloodiest-ever war began following Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.

Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has conducted a retaliatory offensive that has killed more than 34,800 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Police cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University in Washington DC on Wednesday and arrested demonstrators, hours after dozens marched to the home of the school’s president as city officials prepared to appear before Congress on the protest’s handling.

Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and District of Columbia’s Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith were called to testify on Wednesday afternoon at the Republican-led House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, but the hearing was cancelled after the arrests.

Tensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters of the Israel-Hamas war on campuses across the United States, and increasingly in Europe. 

Some colleges cracked down immediately. Others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.

District of Columbia police said officers moved to disperse demonstrators because “there has been a gradual escalation in the volatility of the protest.” It said 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer and unlawful entry. Some protesters were pepper sprayed as police blocked them from the camp.

George Washington University had warned of possible suspensions for continuing the camp on University Yard. Protesters carrying signs that read, “Free Palestine” and “Hands off Rafah,” also marched to school President Ellen Granberg’s home on Tuesday night.

“While the university is committed to protecting students’ rights to free expression, the encampment had evolved into an unlawful activity, with participants in direct violation of multiple university policies and city regulations,” a school statement said.

In France, police detained 86 people following an operation to remove students staging a pro-Palestinian occupation at the Sorbonne university in Paris, prosecutors said on Wednesday.

Those arrested in the police operation on Tuesday night were being held for a variety of public order offences, said the statement.

They include wilful damage, rebellion, violence against a person holding public authority, intrusion into an education establishment and holding a meeting designed to disrupt order. Some are also being held for participation in a group with a view to preparing violence or damage to property.

The day before police moved in, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said there would never be a right to disrupt France's universities with such protests.

In the Netherlands, pro-Palestinian protesters built barricades at the University of Amsterdam, using desks and railings to block off the canalside entrance in the heart of the city as they vowed to stay put until the institution severs all ties with Israel.

Riot police used a bulldozer to knock down barricades at another University of Amsterdam site on Tuesday and detained 169 people, but said the university had not yet asked for similar intervention on Wednesday. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[The EU's climate monitor on Wednesday said last month was the hottest April on record and the 11th consecutive month of historic global heat.

Oceans were also overheating with April marking the 13th straight monthly high for sea surface temperatures, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).

Each month since June 2023 has ranked as the planet's hottest on record, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, the C3S said in a monthly bulletin.

Including April, the world's average temperature was the highest on record for a 12-month period - 1.61 degrees Celsius above the average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.

Some of the extremes - including months of record breaking sea surface temperatures - have led scientists to investigate whether human activity has now triggered a tipping point in the climate system.

"I think many scientists have asked the question whether there could be a shift in the climate system," said Julien Nicolas, C3S Senior Climate Scientist.

Still, the EU's climate monitor also said the natural El Nino phenomenon which warms the Pacific Ocean and contributes to hotter weather globally "continued to weaken" in April towards more "neutral conditions". (Reuters/AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Protests by students demanding universities sever ties with Israel over the Gaza war spread across western Europe on Tuesday, sparking clashes and dozens of fresh arrests.

Students at various European universities, inspired by ongoing demonstrations at US campuses, have been occupying halls and facilities, demanding an end to partnerships with Israeli institutions because of Israel's punishing assault on Gaza.

Several hundred protesters resumed a demonstration around the University of Amsterdam campus, where police the previous night were filmed baton-charging them and smashing up their tents after they refused to leave the grounds.

As protests resumed on Tuesday night, demonstrators erected barriers to access routes watched over by a heavy police deployment.

Police said in a statement that a total of 169 people had been arrested when officers broke up Monday night's protests.

All had been released apart from two still in custody on suspicion of public disorder offences.

Violence had briefly erupted Monday when a small group of counter-protesters wielding flares stormed the main protest.

Around 50 demonstrators were also protesting Tuesday outside the library in Utrecht University and a few dozen at the Technical University of Delft, according to local news agency ANP.

In the eastern German city of Leipzig, the university said in a statement that 50 to 60 people occupied a lecture hall on Tuesday, waving banners that read: "University occupation against genocide".

Protesters barricaded the lecture hall doors from the inside and erected tents in the courtyard, according to the university.

The institution called in the police in the afternoon, and filed a criminal complaint.

Criminal proceedings have been initiated against 13 people who were in the lecture hall on suspicion of trespassing. No arrests have been made so far.

Earlier, at Berlin's Free University, police cleared a demonstration after up to 80 people erected a protest camp in a courtyard of the campus.

The protesters, some of whom wore the keffiyeh scarf that has long been a symbol of the Palestinian cause, sat in front of tents and waved banners.

They later tried to enter rooms and lecture halls and occupy them, according to the university, which said it then called in police to clear the protest.

The university said property was damaged while classes in some buildings were suspended for the day. Berlin police said they made some arrests for incitement to hatred and trespassing.

In Paris, police twice intervened at the prestigious Sciences Po university to disperse about 20 students who had barricaded themselves in the main hall.

Security forces moved in to allow other students to take their exams and made two arrests, according to Paris prosecutors.

The university said exams proceeded without incident.

At the nearby Sorbonne university building, police late Tuesday moved to eject about 100 students who had occupied an amphitheatre and made 88 arrests, police sources said.

In Switzerland, protests spread to three universities in Lausanne, Geneva and Zurich.

The University of Lausanne said in a statement it "considers that there is no reason to cease these relations" with Israeli universities as protesters demand.

In Austria, dozens of protesters have been camped on the campus of Vienna University, pitching tents and stringing up banners since late Thursday. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Police in riot gear cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at the University of Chicago on Tuesday after administrators who had initially adopted a permissive approach said the protest had crossed a line and caused growing concerns about safety.

University president Paul Alivisatos issued a message after officers blocked access to the school's Quad.

“The university remains a place where dissenting voices have many avenues to express themselves, but we cannot enable an environment where the expression of some dominates and disrupts the healthy functioning of the community for the rest,” he wrote.

Hundreds of protesters had gathered for at least eight days at the university until campus administrators warned them on Friday to leave the area or face removal.

On Tuesday, law enforcement dismantled the encampment. Officers later picked up a barricade erected to keep protesters out of the Quad and moved it toward the demonstrators, some of whom chanted, “Up, up with liberation. Down, down with occupation!”

Tensions have continued to ratchet up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the US — and increasingly, in Europe — nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University. 

Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.

Some colleges have cracked down immediately on protests against the Israel-Hamas war.

Since April 18, just over 2,600 people have been arrested on the campuses of 50 colleges and universities, according to figures based on reporting by the Associated Press and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.

As pro-Palestinian protests continue to spread, the White House said President Joe Biden welcomes peaceful protests at college commencement ceremonies where he and other administration officials will speak.

White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden welcomed peaceful protests on campuses and elsewhere, but would continue to condemn hate speech, antisemitism or violence.

"We have been very clear. We believe all Americans should have the right to peacefully protest," she added. "What we don't want to see is hate speech, violence."

Biden is due to give a commencement speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on May 19.

He warned on Tuesday that the threat of antisemitism is growing in the United States, including on college campuses, joining a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.

Biden last week addressed the campus unrest, saying Americans have the right to protest "but not a right to cause chaos" through vandalism, breaking windows or shutting down campuses. (Agencies)]]>

    UN atomic chief bemoans lack of cooperation from Iran

    <![CDATA[UN atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi on Tuesday decried "completely unsatisfactory" cooperation from Tehran after returning from Iran where he urged leaders to adopt "concrete" measures to address concerns over its nuclear programme.

Grossi's visit came at a time of heightened regional tensions and with his International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) criticising Iran for lack of cooperation on inspections and other outstanding issues.

"The present state is completely unsatisfactory for me. We are almost at an impasse and this needs to be changed," Grossi told reporters at the airport in Vienna, where the IAEA is based.

He said there was no "magic wand" to solve a "very, very complex set of issues," while he pressed the Islamic republic to "deliver very soon."

"But of course, for me and also I would say for the international community, there is a need to have some results sooner rather than later," he said.

Earlier on Tuesday, at a news conference in the Iranian city of Isfahan, Grossi said he had proposed to Iranian officials that they "focus on the very concrete, very practical and tangible measures that can be implemented in order to accelerate" cooperation.

Grossi held talks with senior Iranian officials including Atomic Energy Organisation's head Mohammad Eslami and spoke at Iran's first International Conference on Nuclear Science and Technology held in Isfahan.

Grossi insisted on the need to "settle differences" on the nuclear issue while the Middle East was going through "difficult times", particularly the war between Israel and the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

"Sometimes, political conditions pose obstacles to full-fledged cooperation" between Iran and the international community, Grossi told reporters.

Grossi said a March 2023 agreement with Iran was "still valid" but required more "substance."

The agreement was reached during Grossi's last visit to Iran and outlined basic cooperation measures including on safeguards and monitoring.

The IAEA chief said, however, that there had been a "slowdown" in the agreement's implementation, including Iran reducing the number of inspections and withdrawing the accreditation of a group of IAEA experts.

Iran suspended compliance with a landmark 2015 deal setting caps on nuclear activities after the United States unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and reimposed sweeping sanctions. (AFP)]]>

    Canadian police probe shooting near Drake's home

    <![CDATA[Canadian police on Tuesday were investigating a pre-dawn shooting at the home of superstar rapper Drake, whose sprawling property in a tiny Toronto neighbourhood remained cordoned off.

Police inspector Paul Krawczyk said a security guard at the mansion on The Bridle Path road was taken to hospital with serious injuries sustained from an apparent gunshot wound after suspects in a vehicle opened fire.

The shooting, captured on grainy security camera footage that has not been released to the public, happened at 2:09 am (0609 GMT).

The guard was standing outside the gates in front of the residence when the shooting occurred, Krawczyk told reporters.

"I cannot confirm if Drake was home at the time the incident occurred, but I can tell you that we are in contact with his team and they are cooperating," the inspector added.

He said the suspects fled in the vehicle, but no descriptions were offered.

Police taped off most of the area. Several small orange markers, believed to indicate locations of shell casings, could be seen scattered on the road's edge in front of the mansion.

The 37-year-old Drake, known for hits such as "God's Plan" and "Hotline Bling," was the highest-grossing rapper in the world last year.

He is currently embroiled in a feud with Kendrick Lamar, with the rappers exchanging barbed "diss tracks" that have drawn widespread attention.

Beefs are nothing new in hip-hop, a genre long known both for its artists' boasts and their strongly worded takedowns of rivals.

There was no indication that the shooting had any relation to the rap battle.

Asked about the bad blood between Drake and Kendrick Lamar, Krawczyk said he was aware of it, but added, "it is so early in the investigation that we don't have a motive at this time, and so I cannot comment further on that." (AFP)]]>

    Stormy Daniels takes witness stand at Trump trial

    <![CDATA[Stormy Daniels, the porn star at the heart of Donald Trump's hush money case, took the witness stand on Tuesday at the blockbuster trial of the former US president.

"The people call Stormy Daniels," prosecutor Susan Hoffinger announced as the 77-year-old Trump sat at the defence table in the Manhattan courtroom flanked by his lawyers.

Daniels' testimony is expected to be a pivotal moment in the courtroom drama rocking the scandal-plagued Republican's attempt to recapture the White House.

Daniels, 45, a long-time actor and director in the adult film industry, says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and was then paid to keep quiet about it on the eve of his 2016 election against Hillary Clinton, when the news could have sunk his campaign.

Trump denies ever having sex with Daniels and Susan Necheles, a lawyer for the former president, lodged an objection with the judge presiding over the trial to allowing her to testify about any "sexual acts."

"It is unduly prejudicial," Necheles told Judge Juan Merchan.

Hoffinger said Daniels' testimony would not be graphic and would "omit details that are too salacious."

Prosecutors say that Trump – desperate to kill Daniels' story before it could wreck his chances in the narrow 2016 race – illegally reimbursed his fixer and lawyer, Michael Cohen, to cover up the US$130,000 hush money payment.

He is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.

Cohen, who has become a vocal critic of his former boss, is also expected to testify at the trial as a prosecution witness. (AFP)]]>

    Macron hosts Xi Jinping in French mountains

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping on Tuesday continued his state visit to France by visiting the Pyrenees mountains, where he met his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.

At the Tarbes-Lourdes Pyrenees airport, Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, were greeted by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, who took them to lunch high up in the mountains.

After watching traditional dancers perform under the snowy peaks, they ate locally grown ham, lamb, cheese and blueberry pie. Xi said he would give the ham some publicity and also praised the cheese.

Macron gifted Xi a woollen blanket made in the Pyrenees, a Tour de France jersey and armagnac from the nearby southwestern region.

Advisers to the French president described the Pyrenees trip as breaking with protocol for a chance for one-on-one chats with Xi in mountains dear to Macron as the birthplace of his maternal grandmother.

Xi has said he would welcome more high-level talks on trade frictions, and has denied there was a Chinese "overcapacity problem". 

Macron has made trade a priority in the talks, underscoring that Europe must defend its "strategic interests" in its economic relations with China.

Meanwhile, Chinese and French companies had concluded some agreements on Monday ranging from energy, finance and transport on the sidelines of Xi's visit, but most were agreements to cooperate or renewed commitments to work together, and there were no significant deals.

In a sign of some progress, China will allow imports of pig origin protein feed as well as pork offal from France effective immediately, according to statements from Chinese customs and the French farm ministry.

But European hopes of an Airbus plane order to coincide with Xi's visit appear to have been dashed, with the two sides agreeing only to expand co-operation.

Xi travels later on Tuesday to Serbia. 

Writing in Serbian daily Politika ahead of arriving in Belgrade, Xi criticised Nato for its "flagrant" bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in 1999, warning Beijing would "never allow such tragic history to repeat itself". (Reuters/AFP)]]>

    Police break up student protest in Berlin

    <![CDATA[German police on Tuesday broke up a protest by several hundred pro-Palestinian activists who had occupied a courtyard at Berlin’s Free University earlier in the day, the latest such action by authorities as protests that have roiled campuses in the United States spread across Europe.

The protesters had put up about 20 tents and formed a human chain around them. Most had covered their faces with medical masks and had draped kufiyah scarves around their heads, shouting slogans such as “Viva, viva Palestina”.

Police had called on the students via loudspeakers to leave the campus, and officers could also be seen carrying some students away, and using pepper spray against some of the protesters.

The school's administrators said in a statement that the protesters had rejected any kind of dialogue and they had therefore called in police to clear the campus.

“This form of protest is not geared towards dialogue. An occupation is not acceptable on the Free University Berlin campus,” university president Guenter Ziegler said.

The administrators said some protesters attempted to enter rooms and lecture halls at Free University in order to occupy them.

In recent days, students have held protests or set up encampments in Finland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France and Britain, following earlier protests at US campuses. (AP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Vladimir Putin began his fifth term on Tuesday as Russian leader at a glittering Kremlin inauguration, setting out on another six years in office.

Already in office for nearly a quarter-century, and the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, Putin’s new term doesn’t expire until 2030, when he will be constitutionally eligible to run again.

At the ceremony inside the gilded Grand Kremlin Palace, Putin placed his hand on the Russian Constitution and vowed to defend it as a crowd of hand-picked dignitaries looked on.

At 71, Putin dominates the domestic political landscape. 

On the international stage, he is locked in a confrontation with Western countries he accuses of using Ukraine as a vehicle to try to defeat and dismember Russia.

Putin in March won a landslide victory in a tightly controlled election from which two anti-war candidates were barred on technical grounds.

His best known opponent, Alexei Navalny, died suddenly in an Arctic penal colony a month earlier, and other leading critics are in jail or have been forced to flee abroad.

Putin first became Russian leader in late 1999, when he succeeded Boris Yeltsin as president. (Agencies)]]>
