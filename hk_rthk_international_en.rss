    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin would make a two-day state visit to China from May 16 to 17.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced that Putin was coming at the invitation of President Xi Jinping.

The ministry added Putin would meet Xi on Thursday.

The Kremlin also confirmed the trip. 

It said this would be Putin’s first foreign trip since he was sworn in as president and began his fifth term in office.

The Foreign Ministry said Xi would discuss with Putin “cooperation in various fields of bilateral relations...as well as international and regional issues of common concern.”

Analysts have said Russia is increasingly dependent on China since the West hit it with sanctions over its military action in Ukraine.

Beijing has hailed its "no limits" partnership as it enjoys access to vast natural resources, including steady gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline. (Xinhua/Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit meant to reassure Ukrainians of continued American support and flow of weapons as Russia pummels the northeastern Kharkiv region.

Marking his fourth visit to Kyiv since the start of the war in February 2022, Blinken arrived by overnight train from Poland. 

Blinken will aim to reassure Ukrainian officials including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of enduring American support and deliver a speech focused on Ukraine's future.

Kyiv has been on the back foot on the battlefield for months as Russian troops have slowly advanced, mainly in the Donetsk region to the south, taking advantage of Ukraine's shortages of troop manpower and artillery shells. 

Russia's forces hold a significant advantage in manpower and munitions.

On Monday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Washington was trying to accelerate "the tempo of the deliveries" of weapons to Ukraine to help it reverse its disadvantage. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for better relations with South Korea as he met with his counterpart from Seoul during rare talks in Beijing, Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.

The visit by Cho Tae-yul to the capital on Monday and Tuesday is the first visit by a South Korean foreign minister to Beijing in over six years.

Ties between the two countries "have been facing difficulties and challenges", Wang said, according to Xinhua.

He called for the two sides to "understand and respect each other, strengthen communication and exchanges, eliminate misunderstandings and enhance mutual trust", the Xinhua report stated.

He also hoped that Seoul would "properly and prudently" handle Taiwan-related issues and abide by the one-China policy.

Meanwhile, Cho said better ties were in the common interests of both countries and that Seoul was willing to expand mutual trust, according to Xinhua.

Cho also told Wang their countries should work together and "even if there are difficulties, momentum of cooperation should be continued while carefully managing the relations," according to the South Korean foreign ministry.

He added that they could continue to prepare for a summit of the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan in Seoul, planned for the end of May. The leaders of the three countries last met in China in 2019.

The Chinese statement made no mention of the summit.

Wang and Cho also agreed, according to their ministries, that the economic ties of the two countries had been a force in each other's development, and agreed to strengthen their cooperation, including the ensuring of stable supply chains. (AFP/Reuters)]]>

    Fierce fighting rocks Gaza after US warning of anarchy

    <![CDATA[Israel battled Hamas in Gaza on Monday, including in far-southern Rafah, despite US warnings against a full-scale invasion of the crowded city and of the threat from post-war anarchy or insurgency.

Clashes also raged in northern and central Gaza as Israel marked a sombre Memorial Day, followed by Independence Day from Monday night, more than seven months into the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.

Israelis marked a moment's silence and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that "our war of independence is not over yet. It continues even today... We are determined to win this struggle."

AFP correspondents in Gaza reported helicopter strikes and heavy artillery shelling in the east of Rafah, as well as battles in northern Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp and Gaza City's Zeitun neighbourhood.

Israel last week defied a chorus of warnings -- including from top ally Washington which paused a shipment of bombs -- and sent tanks and troops into the east of Rafah to pursue militants.

The city on the Egyptian border had been sheltering 1.4 million Palestinians, according to the United Nations, but Israel's military operation sparked an exodus of nearly 360,000 people from Rafah so far, said the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).

The agency warned that "no place is safe" in the territory, much of which has been reduced to a grey landscape of rubble.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that Washington had not seen any credible Israeli plan to protect civilians in Rafah, and that "we also haven't seen a plan for what happens the day after this war in Gaza ends".

"Israel's on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy and probably refilled by Hamas," he told NBC. (AFP)]]>

    Cohen testifies against former boss in New York

    <![CDATA[Donald Trump's one-time fixer and the star prosecution witness in the former president's historic criminal trial testified on Monday that he lied and bullied for his former boss who looked on silently.

Michael Cohen's testimony followed last week's court proceedings in which adult film star Stormy Daniels gave toe-curling detail about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump which is at the heart of the case.

Trump, 77, is accused of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer Cohen for a hush-money payment to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election, when the story could have proved politically fatal.

Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen if, as a lawyer-fixer for the property tycoon, he lied and bullied people on behalf of Trump.

"Yes... It was what was needed in order to accomplish the task," said Cohen who periodically glanced over at Trump who was slouched in his chair at the defendant's table.

Cohen spent just over 13 months in jail and a year and a half under house arrest after he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for lying to Congress and financial crimes.

In the first weeks of the trial in New York, jurors have heard from witnesses that Cohen was a difficult character who cajoled others to get his way, while the defence counsel have painted him as a pathological liar and convicted criminal.

Cohen testified on Monday that he worked on both personal and corporate issues for Trump, who he claimed did not have an email address for fear of leaving a paper trial that could be used to prosecute him.

Daniels, who claims to have had sex with Trump in 2006, has denied she threatened him if he did not buy her silence for US$130,000, a payment that prosecutors say Trump then covered up.

The trial is taking place six months before the November election, when Trump will try to defeat Democratic President Joe Biden.

During nearly eight hours over two days last week, Daniels walked the jury through the one-night stand she said she had with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament, and then the financial settlement she says ensued.

Trump had sat impassively for much of Daniels's testimony, apparently cursing at times, and railing against proceedings in his comments to reporters as he entered and left the Manhattan courtroom.

Trump has denied having sex with Daniels, and his lawyers asked the judge for a mistrial on the grounds her testimony was "extremely prejudicial" in what is essentially a financial records and election-related case.

Judge Juan Merchan denied two mistrial requests last week.

Merchan has imposed a gag order on Trump prohibiting him from publicly attacking witnesses, and the ex-president -- who has traded insults with Daniels for years, calling her "horseface" and other crude slurs -- has not commented directly on her testimony.

Trump spoke at a rally on a beach in New Jersey on Saturday and condemned the judge as "conflicted" and the prosecutor in the case, Alvin Bragg, as a "radical Democrat."

But he appeared to heed the gag order and avoided naming any witnesses in the case, including Cohen.

In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

He has also been charged in Florida with allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House but that case has been postponed indefinitely. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The world's biggest banks financed fossil fuels to the tune of US$705 billion in 2023, with US and Japanese lenders leading the way, an annual report by climate campaigners said on Monday.

Since the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the top 60 banks have provided a total of US$6.9 trillion to the sector, according to the coalition's 15th annual report titled "Banking on Climate Chaos".

"Financiers and investors of fossil fuels continue to light the flame of the climate crisis," said Tom BK Goldtooth, executive director of Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the report's authors.

Last year's fossil fuel funding was down 9.5 percent from 2022, the report said.

But some banks increased their exposure to climate risk, it said.

JPMorgan was the top financier last year, providing US$41 billion, a 5.4 percent increase from 2022, according to the report.

Japan's Mizuho moved up to second place with US$37 billion, followed by Bank of America at US$33.7 billion.

"As one of the world's largest financiers to both traditional and clean energy companies, we help power today's global economy," said a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson in response.

"We believe our data reflects our activities more comprehensively and accurately than estimates by third parties. Reflecting our strategy of supporting the build-out of zero-carbon power, we set a net-zero aligned Energy Mix target and will disclose a clean energy supply financing ratio." (AFP)]]>

    Rishi Sunak defends beleaguered Tories' track record

    <![CDATA[UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted on Monday that his beleaguered governing Conservative party can win a general election despite polls consistently indicating the opposite, but refused to set a date for the vote.

Sunak mounted a defence of the Tories' 14 years in power and claimed that Britain would be less safe under Keir Starmer's Labour opposition, which is widely tipped to come back to power.

The UK leader said he was "confident" his party would win a fifth consecutive term but conceded that Labour, out of government since 2010, may ultimately inflict defeat.

"I'm clear-eyed enough to admit that, yes, maybe they can depress their way to victory," Sunak said in a speech in central London, accusing Labour of "scaremongering" and "gaslighting".

"But I don't think it will work because at heart we are a nation of optimists," he added, before warning of several dangers himself.

Sunak cited Russia's war in Europe, Iran's firing of missiles in the Middle East and the uncertainty posed by artificial intelligence as threats that needed to be tackled.

He also referred to "authoritarian" states, including and North Korea, Scottish nationalists who want to break away from the United Kingdom and "cancel culture".

"Our country stands at a crossroads," he said.

"I'm convinced that the next few years will be some of the most dangerous, yet most transformational, our country has ever known," Sunak added.

Sunak's speech at the right-wing Policy Exchange think-tank is a clear pre-election pitch to voters, as Labour increasingly puts flesh on the bones of its policies before a manifesto launch.

Its repeated attacks on Starmer also gave an indication of a potentially bitter and personal election battle ahead.

But Sunak refused again to be drawn on when he would call the vote, repeating his well-trodden line that he was aiming for the second half of the year.

He can go to the polls no later than January 2025.

Labour has enjoyed double-digit leads over the Tories in surveys since the disastrous short-lived premiership of Liz Truss that ended in October 2022, and inflicted heavy losses on the Conservatives in local elections earlier this month.

The opposition -- overhauled since Starmer took over in the aftermath of Boris Johnson's election landslide for the Conservatives in 2019 -- has pledged to run the economy responsibly and hopes to match Sunak's recent pledge to raise defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP.

But the prime minister argued that only his party can protect Britons' safety and financial security, even after a decline in defence spending from 2010 to 2016 and the financial meltdown caused by Truss.

"There are storms ahead. The dangers are all too real," said Sunak, a former finance minister.

"But Britain can feel proud again. Britain can feel confident again. Because with bold action and a clear plan, we can and we will create a secure future."

Asked about Sunak's speech, Starmer said security would be the "first priority" of a Labour administration.

He said the choice at the ballot box would be between "a changed Labour Party that puts the country first and party second" and "the chaos and division" of the Conservatives. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[London's Metropolitan Police on Monday said three men were charged with allegedly assisting Hong Kong intelligence services and with foreign interference.

The men have appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged under Britain's National Security Act.

Chi Leung Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, have each been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service. They were not asked to enter any pleas to the charges and will next appear in court on May 24. All three men were granted bail.

Seven men and one woman who were not charged were released from custody, police added.

The Chinese Embassy in the UK said it has made serious representations to UK officials over the matter.

"The Chinese side firmly rejects and strongly condemns the UK’s fabrication of the so-called case and its unwarranted accusation against the HKSAR government," it said in a statement.

The SAR Government said it had "demanded the UK Government to provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter concerned, and the latter's response is awaited".

"The duties of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London are to maintain close liaison with interlocutors in the local government, business, think tanks and various sectors, with a view to enriching bilateral ties in different areas such as trade, investment, arts and culture, enhancing local people and enterprises' knowledge of Hong Kong's unique strengths, and promoting the economic and trade interests of Hong Kong," it said in a statement.

It said it had demanded that London "fairly handle the matter, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office's Office Manager who was alleged to be involved, and ensure that the normal work of the Economic and Trade Office is not affected".

London police said a total of 11 people had been detained earlier this month, nearly all of whom were arrested in the Yorkshire area in northern England.

A police spokesman said, “this investigation remains ongoing, but now that charges have been brought, I urge people not to speculate or comment further in relation to this case.” (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[Millions of Indian citizens across 96 constituencies began casting their ballots on Monday as the country's gigantic, six-week-long election edges past its halfway mark. 

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third straight term with an eye on winning a supermajority in Parliament.

Monday’s polling in the fourth round of multi-phase national elections across nine states and one union territory will be pivotal for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.

Crucial seats in Maharashtra and Bihar states, where the BJP governs in alliances with regional parties, were also up for grabs in this phase.

In Bihar’s Samastipur city, hundreds of voters lined up at a polling station that opened at 7am amid tight security arrangements. Voters said they were concerned about rising food prices, lack of employment and economic development in the state.

Most polls predict a win for Modi and his BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.

The staggered election will run until June 1 and nearly 970 million voters, more than 10 percent of the world’s population, will elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years. 

The votes are scheduled to be counted on June 4. (AP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Dozens of students walked out of Duke University's commencement ceremony on Sunday to protest its guest speaker, comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who has supported Israel throughout the war in Gaza.

About 30 of the 7,000 students present left their seats, chanting “free Palestine” amid a mix of boos and cheers. Some waved the red, green, black and white Palestinian flag.

Videos posted on social media also showed several attendees leaving the viewing stands, including a person wearing a keffiyeh, which can be an emblem of solidarity with the Palestinian cause.

Others shouted "Jerry! Jerry!" as the actor received an honorary degree, and Seinfeld delivered his speech without major interruptions.

"A lot of you are thinking, 'I can't believe they invited this guy.' Too late," he said, after vowing to "defend" the concept of privilege.

"I say, use your privilege. I grew up a Jewish boy from New York. That is a privilege if you want to be a comedian," he added.

"We understand the depth of feeling in our community, and as we have all year, we respect the right of everyone at Duke to express their views peacefully, without preventing graduates and their families from celebrating their achievement," said Duke spokesperson Frank Tramble in a statement.

The walkout at Duke's graduation was the latest manifestation of protests that have roiled US campuses as students call for universities to divest from arms suppliers and other companies profiting from the war, and amnesty for students and faculty who have been disciplined or fired for protesting.

At Emerson College in Boston, chants interrupted remarks by the school's president during its commencement ceremony on Sunday.

Some students could be seen on a recording of the event walking across the stage to receive their degrees carried signs of their support for Palestinians, including one woman who unfurled a Palestinian flag.

The protests have prompted US universities such as Columbia in New York and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles to cancel their main graduation ceremonies this month.

Other colleges and universities have relocated or modified commencement ceremonies. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[Indonesian officials on Monday said the death toll from flash floods and mudslides in Western Sumatra had risen to at least 41 people.

Rescue teams were still searching for another 17 people who remain missing, authorities added.

Torrential rain on Saturday evening caused flash floods, landslides, and cold lava flow, which is a mixture of volcanic ash, rock debris and water that flows like mud, in three districts in West Sumatra province, according to officials.

The cold lava flow, known in Indonesia as a lahar, came from Mount Marapi, one of Sumatra's most active volcanoes.

Officials said around 400 personnel, consisting of local rescuers, police, and military were deployed to search for the missing people on Monday, helped by excavators and drones.

The rescue efforts that began on Sunday were complicated by damaged roads, making it difficult for rescuers to pass through.

The national disaster and management agency (BNPB) said almost 200 houses were damaged and 72 hectares of land, including rice fields, were affected. 

At least 159 people had been evacuated to nearby school buildings, the BNPB said. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Clashes reignited between the Sudanese army and rival paramilitaries earlier this week in the key Darfur town of El-Fasher, the United Nations said on Sunday, killing at least 27 people in one day.

Eyewitnesses have reported air strikes, artillery fire and machine gun clashes battering the city since Friday, when an hours-long battle left an estimated 850 people displaced, according to the UN.

It also killed at least 27 that day, based on what the UN said were "unconfirmed reports", as the city suffers a near-total communications blackout, with medics and human rights defenders barely able to get news to the world.

The fighting has since continued, eyewitnesses said Sunday, reporting air strikes and artillery shelling that left "houses on fire", one resident told AFP.

According to French medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF), two children and a caregiver were killed in an intensive care unit Saturday following a nearby military air strike.

Since April of last year, Sudan has been in the grips of a devastating war between the army, headed by the country's de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.

The RSF has seized four out of five state capitals in Darfur, a region about the size of France and home to around one quarter of Sudan's 48 million people.

El-Fasher is the last major city in Darfur that is not under paramilitary control. The international community, including the UN and the United States, have for weeks warned against a looming offensive on the city. 

MSF said Sunday that an air strike carried out by the army -- which maintains a functional monopoly on the skies -- landed 50 metres from the Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital.

It caused the roof of the ICU to collapse, resulting in "the death of two children who remained receiving treatment there, as well as the death of at least one caregiver," according to a statement.

"The children who were killed were in a critical condition in our ICU, but their lives could have been saved," MSF's head of emergency operations Michel-Olivier Lacharite said. (AFP)]]>

    Kremlin unveils military shakeup, new defence minister

    <![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday moved to replace defence minister Sergei Shoigu in a major shake-up to Russia's military leadership more than two years into war with Ukraine.

Putin proposed economist Andrey Belousov as Shoigu's replacement, according to a list of the ministerial nominations published by the Federation Council, Russia's upper house of parliament.

The move comes at a key time in the conflict with Russian troops advancing in eastern Ukraine and having just launched a major new ground operation against the northeastern Kharkiv region.

Despite a string of military setbacks in the first year of the campaign -- including the failure to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and retreats from the Kharkiv and southern Kherson regions -- Putin had stood by Shoigu until now.

That included when Wagner paramilitary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin launched a bloody insurrection last year calling for Shoigu's removal.

Explaining the timing of the decision, the Kremlin said it needed the defence ministry to stay "innovative".

"The defence ministry must be absolutely open to innovation, to the introduction of all advanced ideas, to the creation of conditions for economic competitiveness," state media quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying in a briefing on the appointments.

"The battlefield is won by whoever is more open to innovation," Peskov said.

"That is likely why the president has settled on the candidacy of Andrey Belousov," he added.

Belousov, who has no military background, has been one of Putin's most influential economic advisers over the last decade.

Shoigu, 68, was appointed Russian defence minister in 2012 and has had a decades-long political career of unmatched longevity in post-Soviet Russia.

His presence at the centre of power in Moscow pre-dates that of Putin himself.

Prior to Russia launching its full-scale military campaign on Ukraine in February 2022, he was seen as one of Putin's most trusted lieutenants.

The pair were regularly photographed on nature retreats in the Siberian wilderness, hunting and fishing together.

In one famous snap from 2017 shared by the Kremlin, they are sitting bare-chested under the sun on a beach by a lake.

On Sunday, Putin simultaneously issued decrees naming Shoigu as the new secretary of the Security Council, replacing his longstanding ally Nikolai Patrushev.

The Kremlin also said Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the General Staff, would stay in post overseeing daily military operations in Ukraine.

"As for the military component, the appointment (of Belousov) will in no way change the current frame of reference," state media quoted Peskov as saying in a briefing on Sunday.

"The military component has always been the prerogative of the Chief of the General Staff. He will continue his activities, and no changes are envisaged there at the moment," he added.

Along with Shoigu, Gerasimov had been targeted by a hardcore group of influential pro-offensive military bloggers for Moscow's perceived military failures.

Prigozhin, who marched on Moscow calling for the pair's removal, died in a plane crash weeks after his aborted mutiny.

Putin is constitutionally required to name a new set of government ministers -- or reappoint existing ones -- following his victory in a March election devoid of opposition.

Lawmakers in Russia's rubber-stamp parliament need to approve the president's nominations, which they are set to do over the coming days.

The future of Patrushev, an arch-hawk who is sometimes seen as a possible successor to Putin, was unclear.

There was no immediate high-level reaction to the shake-up in Ukraine. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Thai authorities intercepted a tonne of crystal methamphetamine in one of the kingdom's biggest ever single seizures of the illegal drug, police said Sunday.

The haul, with an estimated value of more than US$25 million on the international market, was found when officers stopped a pickup truck in central Nakhon Nayok province on Friday.

Acting National Police Chief Kittharath Punpetch said police, military and local officials had been monitoring several smuggling gangs and learned of a plan to move a large amount of the drug, commonly known by the street name "ice".

Kittharath told a news conference that 40 bags of the drug, weighing a tonne in total, were found in the truck.

Its driver was arrested but investigators believe the head of the smuggling network is a Thai national based in a neighbouring country.

The kingdom is a major transit route for illicit drugs produced in the so-called "Golden Triangle" region where northern Thailand, Laos and Myanmar meet.

Myanmar is a major source of amphetamine, much of it produced in illegal labs in border areas controlled by ethnic minority armed groups. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The first living patient to receive a genetically modified pig kidney transplant has died two months after the procedure.

"Mass General is deeply saddened at the sudden passing of Mr. Rick Slayman. We have no indication that it was the result of his recent transplant," the Boston hospital said in a statement issued late on Saturday.

In a world first, surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital in March successfully transplanted the genetically edited pig kidney into Slayman, who was 62 years old at the time and suffering from end-stage kidney disease.

"Slayman will forever be seen as a beacon of hope to countless transplant patients worldwide and we are deeply grateful for his trust and willingness to advance the field of xenotransplantation," the hospital statement said.

Organ shortages are a chronic problem around the world and Mass General said in March that there were more than 1,400 patients on its waiting list for a kidney transplant.

The pig kidney used for the transplant was provided by a Massachusetts biotech company called eGenesis and had been modified to remove harmful pig genes and add certain human genes, according to the hospital.

Slayman, who suffered from Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, had received a transplanted human kidney in 2018, but it began to fail five years later.

When the hospital announced the successful transplant in March, Slayman said he had agreed to the procedure "not only as a way to help (him), but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive."

In a statement posted on Mass General's website, his family said while they were "deeply saddened about the sudden passing of our beloved Rick" they took "great comfort knowing he inspired so many."

The family said they were "comforted by the optimism he provided patients desperately waiting for a transplant".

More than 89,000 patients were on the national kidney waiting list as of March this year, according to a US health department website.

On average, 17 people die each day while waiting for an organ transplant. (AFP)]]>

    Thousands flee Rafah as Israel begins assault

    <![CDATA[War-weary Gazans flooded towards coastal areas of the Gaza Strip's southern city of Rafah on Sunday, fleeing heavy bombardment in eastern zones after Israel ordered them to evacuate.

"We endured three days that can be considered hell," said Mohammed Hamad, a 24-year-old resident of eastern Rafah who was among the 300,000 Palestinians that Israel says have fled the fighting.

Despite international opposition to any major military operation in Rafah, Israel has shifted its focus to the heavily populated area in what it says is an effort to destroy the last bastion of Hamas.

Eastern parts of the city have been heavily bombarded in recent days, according to witnesses, as Israel sent tanks and ground troops into the areas in "targeted raids".

"They were among the worst nights for us since the beginning of the war," Hamad told AFP from Al-Mawasi, an area Israel has designated a "humanitarian zone" despite aid groups warning that it is unprepared for such an influx.

Rafah's population had swelled to around 1.4 million after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled fighting in other areas of the Gaza Strip and sought shelter there during more than seven months of war.

"They started by distributing flyers in the morning, and immediately began brutal artillery and aerial bombardment without giving people a chance to think or organise their belongings properly," Hamad said.

AFP photographers saw dozens of families loading furniture and household items on trucks and fleeing from Rafah, many heading for Khan Yunis, the main city in the south of the Palestinian territory.

Many people, especially women and children, lingered on streets outside their homes before moving out.

The war began with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,034 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.

Israeli forces on Tuesday seized and closed the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing into Egypt -- through which all fuel passes into Gaza.

"There are no medical services or humanitarian aid being provided to the displaced people in the northern Gaza Strip," said Mahmud Basal, spokesman for Gaza's civil defence agency.

"What we are witnessing in terms of killing and destruction reminds us of the early days of the aggression."

Umm Mohammed Al-Mughayyir said she has had to move her family seven times to escape the fighting.

"We have reached a point where we wish for death," she said.

"We have people with special needs, elderly individuals, and children with us. Where do we go when the bombardment never stops, day and night?"

Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said on Sunday that a full-scale Israeli assault on Rafah "cannot take place", insisting that it cannot be squared with international law.

"The latest evacuation orders affect close to a million people in Rafah. So where should they go now? There is no safe place in Gaza!" he said. (AFP)]]>

    At least 34 killed in floods, lahar flow in Sumatra

    <![CDATA[At least 34 people were killed and 16 more were missing in western Indonesia after flash floods and cold lava flow from one of the archipelago's most active volcanoes damaged homes, roads and mosques, local officials said on Sunday.

Hours of heavy rain caused flooding in two districts -- Agam and Tanah Datar -- in West Sumatra province on Saturday evening, threatening thousands after it swept ash and large rocks down Mount Marapi.

"Until now our data shows that 34 people died: 16 in Agam and 18 in Tanah Datar. At least 18 others are injured. We are also still searching for 16 other people," West Sumatra disaster agency spokesman Ilham Wahab told AFP.

He said the search effort involved local rescuers, police, soldiers and volunteers.

Abdul Malik, head of Padang Search and Rescue Agency, told reporters three more people had died but they were yet to be confirmed by other authorities.

Agam and Tanah Datar were hit with flash floods and cold lava flow at around 10:30 pm (1530 GMT) on Saturday, according to the Basarnas search and rescue agency.

Cold lava, also known as lahar, is volcanic material such as ash, sand and pebbles carried down a volcano's slopes by rain.

About 370,000 people live in Tanah Datar, where several mosques and a public pool were damaged, with large rocks and logs scattered on the ground, according to an AFP journalist at the scene.

In Lembah Anai, a popular tourist spot with a waterfall in Tanah Datar, a road connecting the cities of Padang and Bukittinggi was severely damaged and access for cars was cut off.

Aerial images of Tanah Datar showed roads covered by mud, with roofs and a mosque's minarets jutting out of the sea of brown mud.

Ilham said on Sunday that authorities were still receiving reports of missing people from relatives. (AFP)]]>

    Protests won't stop until bombs stop in Gaza: analyst

    <![CDATA[The growing wave of university campus protests around the world in solidarity with Gaza "will not go away" unless the bombs and bullets stop in the besieged enclave, a political commentator in Beijing said. 

Speaking in an interview with RTHK, Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, said although the latest student demonstrations in Europe have been “milder” compared with the ones in the US, such movements will “only expand” as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu eyes a “full-scale” assault of Rafah in Gaza – despite US warnings.

There are over one million displaced Palestinians currently in the southern city of Rafah.

“You cannot expect students in these institutions to stand idly by. They watched 35,000 civilians killed, most of whom were women and children. These images are on social media and people are reacting to them”, said Tangen.

“It’s not a question of ‘do I support Hamas or do I support Israel’. Here, the issue is, people are dying. And such reactions will continue to grow as students realise that it’s not just their individual feelings, but collective feelings about this brutality.”

Protests that first broke out at the Columbia University in New York before spreading across some 140 campuses in the US, have now reached universities in Europe, Australia, as well as India. 

Fuel was added to the fire when President Joe Biden signed into law a military foreign aid package last month, which saw US$17 billion in arms going to Israel. 

Over 2,500 campus demonstrators have been arrested in the US so far.

“The interesting part of it is, you now hear President Joe Biden and many other politicians talking about ‘well, free speech is fine, but you cannot have disorder’. Where was that attitude when for a year Hong Kong suffered under these protests which were disrupting business and threatening people’s lives?” Tangen said. 

With many of the students calling for universities to sell off shares, assets, or other investments in companies linked to Israel and its war in Gaza, a move known as divestment, Tangen believes the students should be listened to. 

“I think it’s very appropriate for the students [to make such requests]. They are not asking for armed intervention from the US in Gaza, they are simply saying ‘don't’ support an entity’ that’s [associated with] killing civilians. Stop sending bombs, weapon systems, and bullets to Israel, and then it [the protests] will stop.”]]>

    <![CDATA[Switzerland's Nemo won the Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday, becoming the first artist identifying as non-binary to claim victory, in a competition marked by controversy over Israel's participation during the war in Gaza.

Twenty-four-year-old Nemo's "The Code" won the highest score from nations' juries, and enough of the popular votes to get 591 points, edging out Croatia in the final, held in Sweden's Malmo.

"I hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue to stand for peace and dignity for every person in this world," a teary-eyed Nemo said while receiving the trophy.

Nemo's journey towards realising their non-binary gender identity served as inspiration for the highly personal winning entry.

"'The Code' is about the journey I started with the realisation that I am neither a man nor a woman," Nemo said.

In Zagreb, a crowd gathered at a square to follow Croatia's Baby Lasagna, who finished second with 547 points.

Twenty-five nations competed Saturday but much of the focus has centred on the controversy of Israel being able to take part.

When Golan went on stage to perform her "Hurricane", both cheers and boos could be heard from the audience in the Malmo Arena.

Outside the arena, police pushed back protesters where more than a hundred demonstrators waved flags and chanted "Free Palestine".

Diverse Malmo is home to the country's largest community of Palestinian origin and according to police at least 5,000 people gathered to protest in the city in the afternoon.

The European Broadcasting Union, which oversees the event, confirmed in March that Golan would take part, despite calls for her exclusion from thousands of musicians around the world.

The same month, contestants from nine countries, including Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[About 50,000 opponents of a foreign agents bill marched peacefully in heavy rain through the Georgian capital on Saturday.

The bill, which would require organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as "agents of foreign influence", has touched off a rolling political crisis in Georgia, where thousands have taken to the streets to demand the bill be withdrawn.

The crowd on Saturday waved Georgian, European Union and some Ukrainian flags and in a break with the past, included more older protesters as well as the many young people who have thronged the streets over the past month.

"The government should hear the free people of Georgia," said one protester in her 30s who gave her name as Nino, waved a large Georgian flag and led one of three columns that converged on the city centre, which blocked much of the city's roads and filled the cobblestoned heart of Tbilisi's old town.

"We want to enter the European Union with our proud nation and our dignity," she said.

Parliament, which is controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and its allies, will begin committee hearings on the bill's third and final reading on Monday. Opposition groups had called for a fresh wave of protests from Saturday.

The crisis has pitted the Georgian Dream ruling party against a coalition of opposition parties, civil society, celebrities and the country's figurehead president, with mass demonstrations shutting down much of central Tbilisi almost nightly for more than a month.

Georgian opponents of the bill have dubbed it "the Russian law", comparing it to legislation used to target critics of President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin. The European Union, which granted Georgia candidate status in December, has said that the bill will pose a serious obstacle to further integration if passed.

Georgian Dream says the bill will promote transparency and Georgian national sovereignty.

Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of Georgian Dream, has said the law is necessary to stop the West trying to use Georgians as "cannon fodder" in a confrontation with Russia. (Reuters)]]>
