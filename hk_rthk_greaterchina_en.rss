    <![CDATA[Defence Minister Dong Jun has spoken with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, the first engagement the defence chiefs of the two countries have had in more than a year as Beijing and Washington seek to restore military ties.

The Defence Ministry cited Dong as telling Austin on the phone that China and the US should explore ways to "get along" and "gradually accumulate mutual trust" by building a "non-conflict, non-confrontation", pragmatic and cooperative relationship between their militaries.

Dong also said the US should recognise Beijing's position on the South China Sea, and respect China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests there. He also stressed that the Taiwan issue is "core of China's core interests".

"China and the US should... take peace as the most precious, stability as the most important," Dong told Austin, according to a ministry readout.

"The military sphere is the key... to stabilising the development of the relationship and preventing major crises from occurring," Dong added.

For his part, Austin "underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea", according to the Pentagon.

The US said the two also discussed the Ukraine war, North Korea, and Washington's commitment to the one China policy.

The phone call comes as President Xi Jinping and his counterpart, Joe Biden, have sought to manage tensions; the two leaders last year agreed to resume direct military talks. (Reuters/AFP)]]>

    China, Germany should guard against protectionism: Xi

    <![CDATA[President Xi Jinping on Tuesday told visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that China and Germany should be vigilant against rising protectionism and view the issue of production capacity objectively.

Xi said the industrial and supply chains of the two countries are deeply intertwined and their markets highly interdependent, and that co-operation was not a "risk" but a guarantee for stable ties and an opportunity for the future.

"We must view and develop bilateral relations in an all-round way from a long-term and strategic perspective," the president said.

Scholz arrived in China on Sunday for a three-day visit, his first since his government launched a "de-risking" strategy last year to avoid relying excessively on Chinese suppliers.

His visit also coincided with European Union concerns about the threat to European businesses from Chinese goods, including electric vehicles and other green technologies, flooding its markets.

Speaking to students at Tongji University in Shanghai on Monday, Scholz called for fair competition in trade relations with China, while urging the EU not to act out of protectionist self-interest.

During his meeting with Xi, Scholz also touched on areas where he said the two countries could cooperate, including climate change.

The two leaders also discussed Ukraine, with Xi proposing four principles to prevent the crisis from spiralling out of control and to restore peace at an early date.

"First, we should prioritise the upholding of peace and stability and refrain from seeking selfish gains. Second, we should cool down the situation and not add fuel to the fire.

"Third, we need to create conditions for the restoration of peace and refrain from further exacerbating tensions. Fourth, we should reduce the negative impact on the world economy and refrain from undermining the stability of global industrial and supply chains," Xi said. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[China's economy grew 5.3 percent in the first quarter year-on-year, official data showed on Tuesday, comfortably beating analysts' expectations, a welcome sign for policymakers as they try to shore up demand and confidence.

Analysts polled by Reuters news agency had expected first-quarter gross domestic product to expand 4.6 percent from a year earlier, compared to 5.2 percent in the previous three months.

Sheng Laiyun, National Bureau of Statistics deputy commissioner, said the nation had made solid progress over the period.

"Generally, in the first quarter, the national economy made a good start, accumulating positive factors and laying a solid foundation for achieving the annual goal," Sheng said.

"However, we should say that there are rising complexities and uncertainties in the external environment," he said, adding that authorities will boost economic vitality, prevent and diffuse risks, as well as enhance the momentum for economic recovery and growth.

Mainland officials are aiming for economic growth of around five percent for 2024, a target that many analysts believe is ambitious and may require more stimulus.

Meanwhile, retail sales and industrial production in China slowed in March.

Retail sales growth slowed to 3.1 percent year-on-year in March, down from a 5.5 percent increase in the first two months of 2024, while industrial production rose 4.5 percent, down from a 7 percent increase in the first two months, official data showed. (Reuters/AFP)

    <![CDATA[German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday called for fair competition in trade relations with China, while also urging the European Union not to act out of protectionist self-interest.

“The one thing that must always be clear is that competition must be fair,” Scholz, who's on a three-day visit to China, told students at Tongji University in Shanghai, according to German news agency dpa.

"In other words, that there is no dumping, that there is no overproduction, that copyrights are not infringed.

“Of course we would like our companies to have no restrictions, but conversely we behave exactly how we are demanding here.”

Scholz is expected to raise the issue of fair competition at a meeting with President Xi Jinping on Tuesday. 

The German chancellor also made comparisons to reservations years ago when Japanese and Korean automakers entered the German market.

“There was great agitation in the newspapers: ‘Now the Japanese cars will come and clean up’... nonsense,” he told the Tongji University students. 

He said there are German cars in China that were made with Chinese manufacturers, and at some point there would also be Chinese cars in Germany and Europe.

The European Union is mulling tariffs to protect its producers against Chinese electric vehicle imports. But the head of Germany’s auto industry association, the VDA, expressed opposition to such tariffs ahead of Scholz’s visit. 

Hildegard Müller told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper the tariffs would not help the European and German auto industries and instead “could quickly have a negative effect in a trade conflict.” (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Sunday expressed deep concern over escalation in the conflict in the Middle East, after Iran launched a massive drone and missile attack on Israel in response to an Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus.

A spokesperson for the ministry called on all parties to exercise calm and restraint after the attacks in the early hours of Sunday.

“The ongoing situation is the latest spillover of the Gaza conflict,” the spokesperson said.

“There should be no more delays in implementing UN Security Council Resolution 2728 and the conflict must end now.”

The spokesperson added: “China calls on the international community, especially countries with influence, to play a constructive role for the peace and stability of the region.”

Earlier on Sunday, the Chinese embassy in Iran advised Chinese nationals and companies in the country to strengthen security precautions, according to official broadcaster CCTV.

A UN Security Council meeting is scheduled to take place later on Sunday. (Additional reporting by Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[China's top legislator and a senior North Korean official emphasised opening a "new chapter" of Beijing-Pyongyang relations, the North's state media said Saturday, as they met for one of the most high-level talks between the allies in years.

Beijing's third highest-ranking official Zhao Leji - the NPC Standing Committee chairman - is on a goodwill visit to the North as the two countries mark 75 years of diplomatic ties.

China is North Korea's most important economic benefactor and diplomatic ally.

Zhao and Choe Ryong-hae, who is the chairman of North Korea's Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, attended an opening ceremony for the "year of DPRK-China friendship" in Pyongyang on Friday, North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said, using the acronym for the North's official name.

"China is ready to work with the DPRK to implement the important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties and the two countries, promote traditional friendship, deepen strategic mutual trust and enhance exchanges and cooperation, so as to jointly write a new chapter of the China-DPRK friendship," Zhao said in a speech, according to Xinhua.

North Korea's Choe said the two countries' relationship "has greeted a new heyday under the wise leadership" of their leaders, KCNA said.

Choe and Zhao were seen sitting next to each other watching performances by what KCNA said were "prestigious art troupes" of the two nations at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre, AFP footage showed. (AFP and Xinhua)]]>

    <![CDATA[Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday urged the United States to play a "constructive role" in the Middle East during a phone call with his US counterpart Antony Blinken.

According to Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, China's top diplomat expressed Beijing's strong condemnation of a deadly Israeli airstrike that destroyed an Iranian diplomatic building in the Syrian capital, Damascus, earlier this month.

The foreign minister emphasised the "inviolable" right to security of diplomatic institutions, and the need to respect the sovereignty of Iran and Syria.

Mao said this round of escalation is the latest manifestation of the spillover from the Gaza conflict, adding that it's imperative for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

She added that China will continue to play a constructive role in the resolution of the Middle East issue, and urged the US to do the same.

The US State Department says Blinken asked Beijing to use its influence to dissuade Iran from striking Israel, after Tehran threatened to retaliate.

Iran had urged the international community to take action against Israel following the attack. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[China’s exports contracted sharply in March while imports also unexpectedly shrank, underlining the task facing the country’s policymakers as they try to shore up a sluggish economy.

Figures from the General Administration of Customs showed that shipments from China slumped 7.5 percent year-on-year to US$279.7 billion, marking the largest fall since last August and missing market forecasts of a 3 percent decline.

It also came in sharp contrast to a 7.1 percent rise during the January-February period.

Imports, meanwhile, also declined last month, dropping 1.9 percent year-on-year to US$221.1 billion, missing an expected 1.4 percent rise. The first two months of the year had seen growth of 3.5 percent.

The latest figures left the country’s trade surplus at US$58.6 billion last month, compared with US$125.1 billion in the January-February period.

For the first quarter, however, both imports and exports rose 1.5 percent.

By region, exports to the US fell 1.3 percent, while imports from the US fell nearly 11 percent in the first quarter. Shipments to Russia rose 3 percent, while those from Russia rose 7 percent.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) remained China’s largest trading partner with exports to the region rising 4.1 percent during the first quarter and imports from the region growing 1 percent.

Wang Lingjun, vice minister of the General Administration of Customs, said that while geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism have brought challenges to global trade, there are signs of a gradual recovery.

He said he expects the country’s trade to stabilise in the second quarter. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Beijing on Friday criticised the United States, Japan and the Philippines and defended its actions in the South China Sea as "lawful" after US President Joe Biden hosted a trilateral meeting in Washington.

Biden on Thursday pledged to defend the Philippines from any attack in the South China Sea at the White House summit.

On Friday, China hit out at the joint summit in Washington, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning saying Beijing "firmly opposes the relevant countries manipulating bloc politics, and firmly opposes any behaviour that provokes or lays plans for opposition, and hurts other countries' strategic security and interests".

"We firmly oppose engaging in closed cliques that exclude others in the region," Mao told a regular press conference.

"Japan and the Philippines can of course develop normal relations with other countries, but they should not invite factional opposition into the region, much less engage in trilateral cooperation at the cost of hurting another country's interests."

China also summoned a Japanese diplomat on Friday to express concern and dissatisfaction over negative comments about it aired during a summit of the leaders of the United States, Japan and Philippines, the Foreign Ministry said. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Queqiao-2 satellite has recently completed in-orbit communication tests, with its platform and payloads working normally, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA) on Friday.

"The functions and performance of Queqiao-2 meet mission requirements, and it can provide relay communication services for the fourth phase of China's lunar exploration project and future lunar exploration missions of China and other countries," said the CNSA.

Queqiao-2 will be used as a communications bridge between the ground operations on earth and upcoming lunar probe missions on the far side of the moon until at least 2030. 

Queqiao-2 researcher and developer Xiong Liang described the satellite as "the main switch" of the whole fourth phase of lunar missions, according to state television CCTV. 

"Only when the main switch is flipped on, all the communications can kick off," Xiong said. 

The satellite successfully completed a communication test on April 6 with Chang'e-4, which is now carrying out an exploration mission on the far side of the moon. From April 8 to 9, it conducted communication tests with the Chang'e-6 probe, which is yet to be launched.

Queqiao-2 was launched on March 20 and entered its target highly elliptical orbit on April 2 after midway correction, near-moon braking and orbital maneuver around the moon.

Two communication and navigation technology test satellites, Tiandu-1 and Tiandu-2, were sent into space together with Queqiao-2 and are now conducting a series of tests on communication and navigation technology.

The landing and sample collection sites of China's moon missions in the coming years are mainly in the lunar south pole region or on the far side of the moon. A more powerful relay satellite with more functions is necessary to provide communications and data transmission services for the missions. (Xinhua)]]>

    <![CDATA[Eight National Games competition events will be staged in Hong Kong as the SAR co-hosts the country's sporting extravaganza with Guangdong and Macau in November 2025.

The Organising Committee of the 15th National Games announced after its inaugural meeting in Guangzhou on Thursday that the city will host track cycling, fencing, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, golf, triathlon, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball.

The SAR will also host bowling as a mass participation event.

The Games will be held between November 9 and 21, 2025. The opening ceremony will take place in Guangzhou and the closing ceremony will be held in Shenzhen.

It's the first time that the SAR will be co-hosting the National Games.

A majority of the events will be held by Guangdong, while Macau will host 3x3 basketball, table tennis and women's volleyball.

"These events are popular and highly competitive, they make for a good spectacle. So compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau can enjoy all these games at their doorsteps," said Zhang Xin of the General Administration of Sport of China.

He added that officials are designing the routes for marathon and road cycling that will go through all three places to promote further integration among them.

Chief Executive John Lee, who led a Hong Kong delegation at the meeting, said the government will adhere to the principle of "simple, safe and wonderful" in organising the Games, making full use of existing venues and the soon-to-be-completed Kai Tak Sports Park.

Sports minister Kevin Yeung said the Kai Tak Sports Park will host the handball, rugby sevens and fencing competitions.

Of the other events, triathlon will take place at the Central Harbourfront; basketball at the Hong Kong Coliseum; track cycling in the Tseung Kwan O Velodrome; beach volleyball at Victoria Park; and golf at the Fanling Golf Course.

Meanwhile, the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD) and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG) will take place between December 8 and 15. 

Hong Kong will host boccia, wheelchair fencing and para table tennis (TT11) under the NGD and table tennis under the NSOG, along with a mass participation event Para Dance Sport.]]>

    <![CDATA[China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, edged up 0.1 percent year on year in March, official data showed on Thursday. 

That was below the 0.4 percent gain forecast by a Bloomberg poll of analysts.

On a monthly basis, the nation's CPI went down 1 percent in March, said the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS),

The core CPI, deducting food and energy prices, went up 0.6 percent year on year last month, maintaining a mild increase, according to the NBS. 

The figure represented a slower rate of growth from 0.7 percent in February when consumer prices emphatically bucked a deflationary trend stretching back to August.

"In March, under the impact of factors such as the seasonal decline in consumer demand after the holidays and the overall sufficient market supply, the increase in the nationwide CPI... somewhat declined," the NBS said.

The slowdown "indicates that China still faces the risk of deflation, as domestic demand remains weak", said Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. (Xinhua/AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Chinese pianist Lang Lang was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles on Wednesday, in the category of live performance.

Lang is the first Asian pianist who has received a star on the iconic sidewalk.

"Internationally renowned pianist Lang Lang has sold millions of albums worldwide, topping classical charts and achieving simultaneous mainstream success," said Steve Nissen, President and CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.

"One of the most influential classical musicians in the entire world, Lang Lang has over 20 million social media followers," said Nissen, adding that everything the pianist does is underpinned by his belief that "music makes life better - it heals, unites and inspires, and it makes us better people."

"The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce is proud to recognize Lang Lang's outstanding contributions to the world of classical music and celebrate his extraordinary talent with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame." Ana Martinez, producer of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, said in a statement.

Lang recalled his upbringing and memories of Los Angeles, saying that music is the common ground for people from different cultural backgrounds.

Music is an important part of the cultural exchanges between China and the United States, the pianist told Xinhua. He hopes that more musicians and artists from China can serve as cultural bridges in the future and bring the elegance of Chinese culture to Western audiences.

"The world communicates through music," Lang said, adding that he hopes to inspire as many people as possible to learn a musical instrument. (Xinhua)]]>

    <![CDATA[Former Kuomintang leader Ma Ying-jeou met President Xi Jinping, in his capacity as general secretary of the Communist Party, in Beijing on Wednesday, according to Xinhua News Agency.

Xi praised Ma for supporting the one-China principle and the 1992 consensus governing cross-strait relations, and his opposition to "Taiwan independence".

Ma, for his part, said people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should avoid conflict or confrontation.

The pair last met in Singapore in November 2015.

Ma, a former Taiwan leader, is on an 11-day visit to the mainland, his second in as many years.

    <![CDATA[The Ministry of Finance on Wednesday said Fitch's downgrade of Chinese credit outlook was "regrettable" after the ratings agency announced the change earlier that day.

"It is regrettable to see Fitch downgrade its outlook on China's sovereign credit rating," the finance ministry said in a statement.

"From the results, it can be seen that the indicator system of Fitch's sovereign credit rating methodology has failed to effectively and proactively reflect Beijing's efforts to promote economic growth."

On Wednesday, ratings agency Fitch downgraded China's sovereign credit outlook to negative, citing increased risks to the country's public finances.

The "outlook revision reflects increasing risks to China's public finance outlook as the country contends with more uncertain economic prospects," Fitch said in a press statement. 

However, Fitch affirmed China's credit rating at "A+", a move it said reflected the country's "large and diversified economy, still solid GDP growth prospects relative to peers, integral role in global goods trade, robust external finances, and reserve currency status of the yuan". (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[Popular video games including "World of Warcraft" will return to China this summer, US developer Blizzard and local partner NetEase said on Wednesday, over a year after a contract dispute pulled them from the market leaving millions of fans bereft.

"Beloved video game titles from Blizzard Entertainment that captivated millions of players in China will return to the market sequentially, beginning this summer, under a renewed publishing deal," the companies said in a statement.

They added that titles including WoW spin-off card game "Hearthstone" and other games in the "World of Warcraft" (WoW) and "Overwatch" franchises would also return to the country.

WoW's Chinese servers went offline in January 2023.

Massively popular worldwide, particularly in the 2000s, WoW is an online multiplayer role-playing game set in a fantasy Medieval world where good battles evil.

It is known for its immersive and addictive gameplay, and players can rack up hundreds of hours of game time.

Blizzard's games launched in China in 2008, through collaboration with internet giant NetEase -- under local law, foreign developers are required to partner with Chinese firms to enter the market.

But after 14 years and acquiring millions of players in China, the two firms announced in November 2022 that talks over renewing their operating contract had failed to lead to an agreement.

"After continuing discussions over the past year, both Blizzard Entertainment and NetEase are thrilled to align on a path forward to once again support players in mainland China and are proud to reaffirm their commitment to delivering exceptional gaming experiences," the companies said in their statement.

    <![CDATA[Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing would "strengthen strategic cooperation" with Moscow, as he met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in the capital for talks.

Lavrov also met President Xi Jinping on Tuesday as part of his two-day official visit to China.

Lavrov arrived in Beijing earlier, with the two countries looking to further solidify diplomatic ties as Russia's war in Ukraine grinds on.

In meetings on Tuesday, Wang promised "China will support Russia's stable development under the leadership of [Vladimir] Putin," according to the Russian RIA Novosti news agency.

The pair also pledged that Beijing and Moscow would continue their cooperation in the fight against terrorism, including through multilateral mechanisms.

The promise came after last month's deadly attack in Moscow left more than 130 people dead, an atrocity which was blamed on the Islamic State terror group.

Wang said they discussed the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine.

"Foreign Minister Lavrov and I had an in-depth communication about several international and regional hotspot issues... including the Ukraine and Palestine-Israel conflicts.

"I would like to emphasise that as a responsible major power, China always decides its own positions independently based on the individual rights and wrongs of each situation.

"At the same time, as a force for peace and stability, China will stick to playing a constructive role on the international stage... and will never add oil to the flames," Wang said. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will travel to China on Saturday for a three-day visit that will include talks with President Xi Jinping.

Scholz will meet Xi and Premier Li Qiang in Beijing at the end of his trip on April 16, the chancellor's spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said at a press conference on Monday.

The German chancellor will also travel to the central city of Chongqing on Sunday, before heading to Shanghai on Monday.

Along the way, Scholz will hold talks with German business executives and give a speech at a university in Shanghai.

He will be accompanied by a trio of cabinet ministers and a German industrial delegation.

The visit to China is Scholz's second since he became chancellor, with the first in November 2022.

Scholz has insisted there will be no "decoupling" from its biggest trading partner, but Germany has also been cautiously nurturing relationships with other countries in Southeast Asia.

As well as trade issues, the war in Ukraine will also be on the agenda during the talks with Xi. "I think China has influence on Russia and our wish would be for China to be able to exercise the influence it has," Hebestreit said. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Monday dismissed as "groundless" US concerns that a surge of low-cost Chinese exports posed a risk to global markets, as Washington's treasury chief Janet Yellen wrapped up her China visit.

During a trip to Paris, Wang said that "the accusations of 'overcapacity' by the United States and Europe are groundless".

Xinhua news agency reported that Wang had pointed out that Beijing would support businesses in defending their interests, and that authorities have repeatedly dismissed concerns over so-called vast state support for industry.

The comments came as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who has wrapped up high-level talks in China, said that Americans would not accept a situation where underpriced Chinese goods flood the global market.

Yellen also said she had raised concerns about China's weak domestic demand and over-investment in industries such as electric vehicles, batteries and solar products, fueled by what she described as "large-scale government support".

Wang had said Chinese electric vehicle makers' rapid growth was due to innovation and established supply chains, not subsidies.

Meanwhile, bilateral ties have stabilised with both sides willing to cooperate on issues including climate change, debt restructuring, and anti-money laundering. (AFP/Reuters)]]>
