    Arsenal grind out Wolves win to go top of the table

    <![CDATA[Arsenal shrugged off the disappointment of their Champions League exit to move back to the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win at Wolves on Saturday.

Leandro Trossard and Martin Odegaard struck at the end of each half to take the Gunners one point clear of Manchester City, who have a game in hand.

Arsenal's season was in danger of coming completely off the rails after a three-game winless run.

Mikel Arteta's men lost in the Premier League for the first time in 2024 last weekend, 2-0 at home to Aston Villa, in between a Champions League quarter-final elimination by Bayern Munich.

However, they bounced back to keep the pressure on champions City, who beat Chelsea 1-0 to reach the FA Cup final earlier on Saturday.

Arteta made just three changes from the side that lost 1-0 in Munich on Wednesday and it took some time for the sluggish visitors to find their stride.

Wolves boss Gary O'Neil claimed his side have been struck by the worst injury crisis he has encountered in his professional career.

Yet, the undermanned hosts were nearly in front when David Raya was forced to turn Joao Gomes' powerful effort onto the crossbar.

Arsenal had only fleetingly threatened before the break despite their dominance of possession.

But they got the slice of fortune they needed to kickstart their challenge for a first title in 20 years on 44 minutes when Trossard's mishit shot clipped in off the far post.

There was little in the way of goalmouth action in the second period as fatigue took hold of Arsenal in their fourth game in 11 days.

However, shorn of the threat of the injured Matheus Cunha and Pedro Neto, Wolves lacked the attacking inspiration to further dent their title aspirations.

Odegaard made the points safe five minutes into stoppage time by catching Jose Sa out at his near post.

Third-placed Liverpool can move level on points with Arsenal when they visit Fulham on Sunday.

At the bottom of the table, Luton's hopes of survival were hammered by Brentford's 5-1 rout at Kenilworth Road.

Luton's heaviest home league defeat of the season leaves the Hatters still one point adrift of Nottingham Forest, who visit Everton on Sunday in a huge clash at the bottom of the table.

"Today was a bad day for us as a club but the teams directly above us play each other and we will not be out of it this weekend. It's important we all remember that," said Luton boss Rob Edwards.

Brentford realistically secured their top-flight status with a dominant display despite missing England striker Ivan Toney through injury.

Yoane Wissa struck twice before half-time, while Ethan Pinnock, Keane Lewis-Potter and Kevin Schade were also on target for the Bees.

Burnley are now within two points of Luton and three of survival after cruising to a 4-1 victory at rock bottom Sheffield United.

Two of the Clarets' five league wins this season have come against the Blades.

Burnley scored twice in two minutes just before half-time through Jacob Bruun Larsen and Lorenz Assignon.

Gustavo Hamer pulled a goal back for the home side early in the second period.

But United are destined to head straight back down to the Championship due to their woeful defending.

Lyle Foster and Johann Gudmundsson rounded off the scoring to leave Chris Wilder's men 10 points adrift of safety with just five games remaining.

"I won't name names, but I think there were a few players out there who wanted to get out of there pretty quickly after the fourth went in," said Wilder. "You just can't have (that)." (AFP)]]>

    Man City sink wasteful Chelsea to reach FA Cup final

    <![CDATA[Bernardo Silva fired Manchester City back into the FA Cup final as the Portugal midfielder's late strike sealed the holders' 1-0 win against Chelsea at Wembley on Saturday.

Pep Guardiola's side were second best for long periods of the semi-final, but Chelsea wasted a string of chances before Silva delivered the knockout blow six minutes from full-time.

Shaken by their Champions League quarter-final loss against Real Madrid on penalties in midweek, City took a while to shake off the gloom from the end of their treble bid.

They were hampered by the absence of Norway striker Erling Haaland after he suffered a knock against Real, with Julian Alvarez unable to make an impact as his replacement.

City were bailed out by Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson's profligacy and Guardiola will hope the hard-fought success provides a timely lift as they chase a Premier League and FA Cup double.

City face Manchester United or Coventry, who meet on Sunday, in the final on May 25 and will retain the Premier League title if they win their last six games.

It will be City's 13th final in the competition and potentially a repeat of last year's 2-1 win over United in the Wembley Manchester derby.

Beaten by Liverpool in the League Cup final in February, Chelsea's wait to win their first domestic trophy since the 2018 FA Cup goes on for another season.

It was a bitter blow for Blues boss Mauricio Pochettino, who has endured a difficult first season in charge and remains without silverware in England.

The semi-final was billed as in-form Chelsea forward Cole Palmer's chance to punish his old club for selling him to the Blues in September.

Guardiola said Palmer was asking to leave City for two years before he eventually joined Chelsea, where he has scored 23 goals in all competitions this, including 11 in his last six games.

Palmer, who scored four times in Monday's 6-0 rout of Everton, was a constant threat for Chelsea, but ultimately it was his team's lack of killer instinct that proved decisive.

Palmer's pin-point pass sent Jackson racing into the City area early on, but his strike lacked the accuracy to beat Stefan Ortega in a miss that foreshadowed Chelsea's fate.

Jackson wasted a golden opportunity to give Chelsea the goal their dominance deserved.

Enzo Fernandez's pass split the City defence, but Jackson opted to go around Ortega rather than shoot and the chance was gone as Nathan Ake scurried back to clear.

Playing with more purpose and quality than City, Pochettino's team threatened again as Palmer cleverly shimmied past Rodri for a low drive from 12 yards that was well saved by Ortega.

It was the first time lethargic City had failed to muster a first half shot on target since a game against Everton in February.

Jackson, in the midst of a terrible debut season, was put clean through on goal by Conor Gallagher immediately after the interval.

But the much-maligned striker's shot was palmed away by Ortega, who clawed away a close-range header from Jackson seconds later.

City finally tested Djordje Petrovic through Phil Foden's snap-shot, but the Serbian was equal to his powerful strike.

Chelsea appealed in vain for a penalty when Jack Grealish's arm blocked Palmer's free-kick, while Moises Caicedo was fortunate to escape a second booking for a crunching tackle that forced Grealish to limp off.

Grealish's replacement Jeremy Doku drew an immediate save from Petrovic with a near-post blast.

Doku's presence lifted City and the Belgian played a part as they stole the victory in the 84th minute.

Advancing with intent towards the Chelsea area, Doku slipped a pass to Kevin de Bruyne, whose low cross was pushed out by Petrovic to Silva for a close-range finish that deflected home as Guardiola punched the air in relief. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Sweden's Armand 'Mondo' Duplantis opened his outdoor season in stunning fashion on Saturday as he bettered his own pole vault world record at the Xiamen Diamond League meeting.

Duplantis, the reigning Olympic, two-time world and European champion, cleared 6.24 metres at his first attempt at the Egret Stadium to improve by 1cm his previous best set in Eugene last year.

The US-born 24-year-old entered the competition at 5.62m, clearing 5.82 and 6.00m before setting the new world record â€“ his eighth in the discipline.

American Sam Hendricks finished second with a best of 5.82m, China's Bokai Huang claiming third (5.72).]]>

    <![CDATA[Triple world champion Max Verstappen took pole position on Saturday for the Chinese Grand Prix, 0.322 seconds ahead of Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso third.

Verstappen clocked a fastest lap of 1 minute and 33.660 seconds to cap a perfect day after earlier winning the sprint race at the Shanghai International Circuit.

Lando Norris will start on the second row in his McLaren alongside Alonso for Sunday's race, the first grand prix to be held in China since 2019 because of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.

Oscar Piastri was fifth fastest in the second McLaren ahead of the Ferrari pair of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, with George Russell's Mercedes eighth.

It was a dominant day for the Dutchman who overcame electrical gremlins to blast from fourth on the grid to an emphatic victory in the morning sprint, 13 seconds ahead of Lewis Hamilton.

The win increased his championship lead over teammate Perez to 25 points.

But Hamilton's joy at coming second in the sprint turned to despair in the first qualifying stint when the Englishman locked up near the end of his final flying lap, relegating him to only 18th fastest.

It was the first time since the 2022 Saudi Grand Prix that the seven-time world champion had been knocked out in Q1. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Max Verstappen overcame early electrical gremlins to blast from fourth on the grid to an emphatic victory in the Chinese Grand Prix sprint race on Saturday, 13 seconds ahead of Lewis Hamilton.

The Dutchman charged past the seven-time world champion Hamilton's Mercedes on lap nine of the 19-lap dash.

Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez was third after a thrilling battle with the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, and the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso.

"The first few laps were hectic," said Verstappen after claiming the eight points on offer for the winner of the first sprint of the season at the Shanghai International Circuit.

"The wind is changing a lot which makes it difficult to drive.

"Once we sorted (the battery) out we were OK," Verstappen added as he extended his championship lead to 25 points over Perez.

Leclerc and Sainz ended up fourth and fifth after swapping places numerous times in the dramatic tussle for the minor places with Perez and Alonso.

Aston Martin's Alonso came out worst as he went wheel-to-wheel with the Ferraris, having to retire his car on lap 18 with a puncture suffered in the skirmish.

On the first Chinese Grand Prix weekend since 2019, huge crowds turned out to see Shanghai native Zhou Guanyu, China's first Formula One driver, make his home debut in his third season in the premier racing class.

Tickets for Sunday's main race sold out in minutes and fans had plenty to cheer Friday when Zhou propelled his Sauber into the top 10 in a wet sprint qualifying session.

He started from 10th and in dry conditions for the race and moved up one place after the opening skirmishes.

Zhou agonisingly finished just out of the points in ninth after being passed late on by Russell, who started down in 11th on the grid but made the most of starting on quicker soft tyres. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[World number one and defending champion Iga Swiatek took her Stuttgart winning streak to 10 matches on Friday with a straight sets victory over Emma Raducanu while Marketa Vondrousova stunned three-time runner-up Aryna Sabalenka to also make the semi-finals.

Top seed Swiatek, the 2022 and 2023 champion at the German clay-court tournament, saw off former US Open champion Emma Raducanu 7-6 (7/2), 6-3 in her quarter-final.

The 22-year-old Pole needed just over two hours to defeat Raducanu who was playing in her first quarter-final since 2022.

Despite her loss, there were encouraging signs of a return to form for the Briton.

Her two wins for Britain in the Billie Jean King Cup win against France last weekend followed by two victories in Stuttgart mark the first time she has won four matches in a row since her 2021 US Open title triumph.

The former world number 10 came into Stuttgart ranked at 303. Twelve months ago, Stuttgart proved to be her final event of 2023 before undergoing surgery on both wrists and her ankle.

Swiatek will face fourth-seeded Elena Rybakina, who defeated Jasmine Paolini 6-3, 5-7, 6-3, for a place in the final.

Vondrousova reached her first semi-final since clinching the Wimbledon title last July when she stunned world number two Sabalenka.

The sixth-seeded Czech came through 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 as the 24-year-old celebrated her first win over Sabalenka in six years after losing four in a row between 2018 and 2023.

Australian Open champion Sabalenka had been attempting to make the Stuttgart final for a fourth successive year.

The powerful Belarusian crunched 35 winners to Vondrousova's 17, but committed 48 unforced errors compared to 19.

Vondrousova crucially converted seven of eight break points while Sabalenka only capitalised six times from 15 opportunities.

Vondrousova will face either third-ranked Coco Gauff, the US Open champion, or Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine for a place in Sunday's final. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[World Athletics president Sebastian Coe's decision to award prize money to Olympic gold medallists was welcomed by athletes but has sparked a backlash from bosses of other sports.

Coe put the cat among the pigeons when he announced last week that track and field gold medallists at the Paris Games this year will receive US$50,000 (HK$391, 677).

It's the first time a sports federation will pay prize money at an Olympics.

The total prize fund of US$2.4 million will come from the International Olympic Committee's revenue share allocation that World Athletics receives every four years.

In the strongest criticism, the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) said on Friday the move "undermines the values of Olympism and the uniqueness of the Games".

"One cannot and should not put a price on an Olympic gold medal," it added.

The head of one leading Olympic sport, International Cycling Union (UCI) president David Lappartient, made clear his displeasure.

"If we concentrate money on top athletes, a lot of opportunities will disappear for athletes all over the world," the Frenchman said.

"We really believe that this is not the Olympic spirit. The proposal was not discussed."

It was not just the decision to pay prize money that annoyed Coe's fellow federation chiefs.

"ASOIF was neither informed nor consulted in advance of the announcement," it said, adding "it is important and fair to discuss the matter at stake with the other federations in advance".

"What surprised everybody is that Coe took the decision unilaterally with one hour's warning to the IOC and zero hours warning to other federations," Michael Payne, a former IOC marketing director who retains close links to the body, told AFP.

"The view of the federations, not unreasonably, is that they have been thrown under a bus. What are you going to do only three months before Paris?" Payne said.

Coe, a double Olympic 1500m champion in the 1980s, said his sport had long since ceased to be amateur "so it is very important that the sport recognises that change in landscape".

In a statement to AFP on Friday responding to the federations' criticism, World Athletics said paying prize money was "about underscoring our unwavering commitment to empowering the athletes and recognising the critical role they play in the success of any Olympic Games".

The statement said it was impossible to put a "marketable value" on winning an Olympic medal.

"But we think it is important to make sure some of the revenues generated by our athletes at the Olympic Games are directly returned to those who make the Games the global spectacle that it is," World Athletics added. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The top three in Sunday's Beijing half marathon have been stripped of their medals, organisers said, following an investigation into the finish that saw China's He Jie controversially win.

"Today the 2024 Beijing Half Marathon Organising Committee issued a decision on the investigation and handling of the men's race results," a state media report said on Friday.

It added: "The trophies, medals and bonuses will be recovered."

The race's bizarre finish saw He cross the line first after two runners from Kenya and one from Ethiopia seemed to deliberately allow him to win.

All four were "punished" and their results cancelled, CCTV reported.

The Chinese Athletics Association said earlier this week they had met, issuing a statement vowing to make improvements to the sport in the country. (AFP)]]>

    Liverpool out of Europa League as Leverkusen advance

    <![CDATA[Liverpool crashed out of the Europa League after a 1-0 win against Atalanta that wasn't enough to overturn their quarter-final deficit, while Bayer Leverkusen's 1-1 draw at West Ham took the German champions into the last four on Thursday.

In Jurgen Klopp's last season as Liverpool boss, the Reds were hoping to give the German a memorable farewell in the final in Dublin.

But Liverpool had suffered a stunning 3-0 loss in the first leg against Atalanta at Anfield last week.

And although Liverpool have authored some of European football's greatest comebacks down the years against the likes of St Etienne, AC Milan and Barcelona, there would be no miracle escape this time.

Mohamed Salah converted a seventh minute penalty in the second leg in Bergamo after Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross hit Matteo Ruggeri's arm.

However, Klopp's men couldn't breach the stubborn Atalanta defence again.

Bidding to reach their maiden European final, Gian Piero Gasperini's Atalanta will face Marseille in their first European semi-final since the 1988 Cup Winners' Cup.

Fresh from clinching their first Bundesliga title last weekend, Leverkusen survived a scare from West Ham before advancing 3-1 on aggregate.

In the semi-finals, Xabi Alonso's side will play Roma, who saw off Italian rivals AC Milan 3-1 on aggregate.

Leverkusen won the first leg 2-0 but West Ham made the perfect start in east London when Michail Antonio met Jarrod Bowen's pin-point cross with a close-range header in the 13th minute.

West Ham eventually ran out of steam and Jeremie Frimpong struck in the 89th minute with a shot that deflected in off Aaron Cresswell. (AFP)]]>

    FA Cup says no more replays from first round

    <![CDATA[FA Cup replays will be scrapped from the first round onwards from next season as part of an agreement with the Premier League, the Football Association announced on Thursday.

The FA had already dropped replays from the fifth round onwards and said the move to ditch them from earlier rounds had been agreed "in light of changes to the calendar driven by the expanded UEFA (European) competitions".

From next season the Champions League will feature an extra 64 games, creating increased pressure on the domestic calendar.

World governing body FIFA has announced an expanded 32-team Club World Cup for 2025.

But the English Football League (EFL), which oversees tiers two, three and four, said it would seek compensation over the "frustrating and disappointing" decision to scrap replays, which provided vital income for lower division clubs when they played bigger teams.

The FA said all rounds of the FA Cup would now be played at weekends and there will be no Premier League matches on weekends set aside for the fourth and fifth rounds and the quarter-finals.

Teams from the third and fourth tiers of English football enter the FA Cup in the first round, with Premier League and Championship clubs joining from the third round.

The FA Cup qualifying rounds for clubs outside the top four tiers will still have replays.

EFL chief executive Trevor Birch said: "This represents another lost traditional revenue stream for EFL clubs at a time when the financial gap between the biggest clubs and those further down the pyramid is growing bigger than ever.

"We will now be discussing the implications for EFL clubs and seeking appropriate compensation arrangements."

The changes announced on Thursday, which are part of a six-year agreement, will also mean the removal of the mid-season break from the Premier League calendar.

The English top-flight will start the 2024/25 season in mid-August to give players a consecutive three-week break, taking into account "expert advice from medical and technical departments".

As part of the new deal, the Premier League is "providing up to an additional 33 million pounds (HK$321.6 million) for grassroots football".

The FA said the agreement would secure up to 133 million pounds per season in funding in total from the 2025/26 campaign.

FA chief executive Mark Bullingham said: "This new agreement between The FA and the Premier League strengthens the FA Cup and gives this very special tournament exclusive weekends in an increasingly busy calendar.

"The longer summer period also allows a much-needed player break before the start of the next season."

Premier League chief executive Richard Masters added: "Throughout our discussions both parties have been committed to enhancing the scheduling of the FA Cup, a hugely important domestic competition with a storied history."

The FA Cup semi-finals will be played at Wembley this weekend, with holders Manchester City meeting Chelsea on Saturday and Manchester United facing Coventry on Sunday. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Philadelphia 76ers, fueled by 23 points from NBA Most Valuable Player Joel Embiid, rallied to beat the Miami Heat 105-104 on Wednesday and book a first-round NBA playoff clash with the New York Knicks.

Embiid, still not back to peak form after missing two months after undergoing knee surgery, stepped it up in the second half for the Sixers, who trailed by as many as 13 in the third quarter in the NBA Play-in tournament clash.

Embiid scored 13 points in the second half, drilling a go-ahead three-pointer with 2:33 left to play.

The lead would change hands twice before Embiid found Kelly Oubre Jr. in the lane for a basket and a free throw that put Philadelphia ahead for good with 36 seconds remaining.

Sixers reserve Nicolas Batum scored 17 of his 20 points in the second half and came up with a big block on Tyler Herro with 26.2 seconds left, the 76ers draining a series of free-throws to seal the win.

The victory gave Philadelphia the seventh seed for the Eastern Conference playoffs and they will open their series against the second-seeded Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Saturday.

Miami, who emerged from the play-in to reach the NBA Finals last year, can still make the playoffs.

On Friday they play a must-win game against the winner of Wednesday's later play-in clash between the Chicago Bulls and Atlanta Hawks, with the winner booking a first-round meeting with the top-seeded Boston Celtics.

The Heat will be keeping an eye on star Jimmy Butler, who was rocked by a collision with Oubre under the basket late in the first quarter.

Butler stayed in the game and finished with 19 points and five steals but was limping noticeably by the end of the contest.

Herro led the Heat's scoring with 25 points â€“ 16 in the fourth quarter to help Miami keep the pressure on until the waning seconds. (AFP)]]>

    Former badminton number one Momota retires

    <![CDATA[Two-time world champion Kento Momota said Thursday he is retiring from international badminton aged 29, ending a top-level career that never recovered from a car crash four years ago.

Momota, who had already missed out on a place at the Paris Olympics, will play for Japan for the last time at the Thomas Cup in China later this month.

The former world number one will only feature in domestic competitions in Japan after that and not on badminton's World Tour.

"I have made this decision because it feels like I have reached my physical and mental limit in trying to get back to being the best in the world," Momota, now ranked 52, said in a statement.

Momota was once badminton's undisputed king, winning 11 titles in 2019 and losing just six of the 73 matches he played that year.

But his life was turned upside down in January 2020 when the vehicle taking him to Kuala Lumpur airport crashed hours after he won the Malaysia Masters.

The driver was killed and Momota needed surgery to repair a fractured eye socket.

He suffered double vision and struggled to regain his previous form when he returned to competition after a year out of action.

He lost in the opening round at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and fell at the first hurdle in four of the first five tournaments he entered the following year.

He was also hampered by injuries and saw his world ranking plummet as former rival Viktor Axelsen established himself as badminton's top player.

Momota, who was embroiled in a gambling scandal earlier in his career, ended a two-year title drought when he won the Korea Masters in November last year.

Momota had targeted this summer's Paris Olympics but his national ranking was not good enough to earn him a spot in Japan's team.

He was banned from selection for the 2016 Rio Olympics for gambling at an illegal casino. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Rafael Nadal suffered his first defeat on his return to tennis after injury as he fell 7-5, 6-1 against Alex de Minaur on Wednesday in the Barcelona Open second round.

The 22-time Grand Slam title winner, back on court this week after three months on the sidelines, battled well but eventually crumbled against the hard-working world number 11 from Australia.

Nadal, 37, who missed virtually all of the 2023 season, is hoping to compete at the French Open in May where he is the record 14-time champion.

The Spaniard, who has won the Barcelona clay-court title on 12 occasions, had eased past Flavio Cobolli on Tuesday in his first ATP Tour match since January, but said he was not favourite against De Minaur who has now won his last two clashes against the former world number one.

It proved a far tougher challenge and despite showing flashes of his supreme quality on the court named after him, Nadal came up short in what he said he believes is his final appearance at the tournament.

The Australian broke in the first game and tested Nadal with a series of brilliant drop shots which Nadal could not reach.

However Nadal hit back with a break of his own in the sixth game and consolidated with a fizzing backhand for a 4-3 lead.

De Minaur broke to love to take a 6-5 lead as Nadal went wide and sealed the first set when the Spaniard pushed a shot into the net, winning the final 10 points as Nadal started to struggle.

The 25-year-old Australian broke for a 2-1 lead in the second set when Nadal could not return a powerful passing shot, and secured another break for 4-1.

De Minaur wrapped up his emphatic second set performance with a third break when Nadal went long. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[New Orleans forward Zion Williamson has been ruled out of Friday's must-win NBA play-in game against the Sacramento Kings with a left hamstring strain, the Pelicans said Wednesday.

The Pelicans said an MRI exam on Wednesday confirmed the injury, and Williamson will be reevaluated in about two weeks.

Williamson had 40 points and 11 rebounds before exiting with the game tied with 3:13 to play in Tuesday's play-in loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.

His driving basket had just knotted the score at 95-95 when he grimaced in pain and headed for the sideline, only to depart for the locker room shortly thereafter.

Williamson, the top pick in the 2019 draft whose career has been hampered by a string of injuries, was playing in the first post-season game of his career.

Although the Pelicans reached the first round of the playoffs in 2022, he missed all of the 2021-2022 campaign recovering from a broken foot.

He also missed the team's play-in game last season.

The winner of Friday's game will advance as the eighth seed in the Western Conference and take on conference winners Oklahoma City in the first round of the playoffs.

The Pelicans won all five of their games against the Kings in the regular season, with Williamson playing in four of those contests. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Real Madrid exacted revenge on Manchester City to reach the Champions League semi-finals 4-3 on penalties after withstanding a barrage at the Etihad on Wednesday, and will face Bayern Munich in the last four after the German giants beat Arsenal 3-2 on aggregate.

Rodrygo gave Real early lead before Kevin De Bruyne hit back for the holders to leave the match level at 1-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate.

However, City's defence of the competition came to an end after Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic saw spot-kicks saved by Madrid's unlikely hero Andriy Lunin.

The Ukrainian, who has deputised this season for the injured Thibaut Courtois, had been at fault for City's early opener in a thrilling first leg but more than made amends.

City had not lost at home in the Champions League since 2018 but the holders were held at bay by a heroic defensive effort by the 14-time European champions despite having 34 attempts on goal.

"It's so difficult. They are continuously probing with the ball and move you around. Most teams would fall apart when City get on top of you but we stood up really well," said Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham.

"Today it came down to mentality."

"In other sports for the stats we would win but football is like this and it's marvellous," said Guardiola.

"Congratulations to Madrid because their capacity to resist and defend till the end, they did so fantastically. We didn't manage to score in the final pass or final shot."

A 63rd-minute Joshua Kimmich header gave Bayern Munich a 1-0 win over Arsenal in their quarter final second leg.

The 3-2 aggregate quarter-final victory means Bayern return to the last-four for the first time since winning the title in 2020. (AFP)]]>

    McIlroy dismisses LIV report, pledges future to PGA

    <![CDATA[Rory McIlroy rubbished reports linking him with a move to LIV Golf on Tuesday, vowing to remain a PGA Tour player for the rest of his career.

A report in Britain said McIlroy â€“ a long-time critic of the upstart Saudi circuit â€“ was poised to switch to LIV in a staggering deal worth US$850 million.

But the four-time major winner from Northern Ireland swiftly debunked the rumors in an interview with NBC's Golf Central on Tuesday.

"I honestly don't know how these things get started," McIlroy said.

"I've never been offered a number from LIV, I've never contemplated going to LIV. Again, I think I've made it clear over the past two years that I don't think it's something for me."

LIV has signed a slew of golf's elite since its formation, with Spanish star Jon Rahm the last big name to make the switch last December in a move reported to be worth around $500 million.

McIlroy, who has been increasingly conciliatory towards LIV professionals in recent months amid ongoing negotiations with the PGA Tour over a merger, reiterated that he bore no ill will to golfers who have joined the circuit.

"One of the things I think I've realized over the past two years is that people can make their own decisions on whatever they think is best for themselves," McIlroy said.

"Who are we to judge them for that? But personally for me my future is here on the PGA Tour and it's never been any different.

"I'm here today and playing a PGA Tour next week and I'll play the PGA Tour for the rest of my career."

McIlroy was speaking ahead of this week's RBC Heritage in South Carolina where he is among a star-studded field taking part following last week's Masters at Augusta. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Kylian Mbappe struck twice as Paris Saint-Germain battled back to beat 10-man Barcelona 4-1 and book a place in the Champions League semi-finals with a 6-4 aggregate triumph on Tuesday, while Borussia Dortmund fought back to beat Atletico Madrid.

PSG's hopes of going all the way in Europe's elite club competition for the first time hung in the balance after they lost 3-2 at home to Barca in the first leg of their quarter-final last week.

But they seized the opportunity given to them in Catalonia after Ronald Araujo's red card left Barcelona to play over an hour with 10 men, allowing Luis Enrique's team to go on and win 4-1 on the night and 6-4 on aggregate.

PSG were rampant with the extra player, as Ousmane Dembele again stood out against his old team by scoring the equaliser on the night and winning a penalty which Kylian Mbappe converted to put PSG ahead in the tie.

In between, the outstanding Vitinha â€“ who had already scored in the first leg â€“ netted with a brilliant strike from outside the box, and Mbappe made sure of the win late on to spark wild celebrations in the away contingent at Montjuic.

The final scoreline was identical to that on their last visit to Barcelona in February 2021, when Mbappe hit a hat-trick in the first leg of a last-16 tie they eventually won 5-2 on aggregate.

But the manner of this victory surely finally exorcises the ghost of their humiliating collapse in Barcelona in 2017, when they won 4-0 at home in the first leg only to lose 6-1 in the return in a stunning implosion.

Borussia Dortmund beat Atletico Madrid 4-2 in their quarter-final second leg, securing a 5-4 aggregate victory and a first Champions League semi-final since 2013.

Trailing 2-1 from the first leg, goals from Julian Brandt and Ian Maatsen had Dortmund 2-0 up at half-time.

Visiting coach Diego Simeone made three changes at half-time including bringing on Angel Correa and his energy told immediately, Mats Hummels conceding a poor own goal before the Argentine netted to put Atletico back ahead in the tie.

But those goals brought a sluggish Dortmund back to life, with Niclas Fuellkrug and Marcel Sabitzer each scoring in a three-minute period to send the Bundesliga club through. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Eiffel Tower's countdown clock to the Paris 2024 Olympics turned to 100 days on Tuesday as preparations for the Games entered the final straight.

The Olympic torch was lit in ancient Olympia earlier in the day. It will reach France on May 8 in the port city of Marseille, after a journey on the three-masted Belem ship.

All permanent infrastructures for the Games are now ready, and the building of temporary sites has started in Paris, notably on the Place de la Concorde.

Organisers will count on the flame relay across France for the mood to swing in the country as the July 26-August 11 Games approach.

Last month, a poll showed that, in France, 57 percent of people felt little or no enthusiasm for the Paris Games.

Paris 2024 posters were displayed in metro stations on Tuesday and some landmark monuments paid tribute to the upcoming Games, while the stairs leading up to the Sacre Coeur basilica were being painted with the Games' colours. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Two years ago the Shanghai International Circuit hosted a Covid hospital, but this weekend it will stage Formula One once more as the sport returns to China for the first time since the pandemic.

Adding to the excitement of fans, they will see Shanghai native Zhou Guanyu drive at his home track in Formula One for the first time.

"I'm extremely excited, in these 5,000 years of [Chinese] history there has only been one Zhou Guanyu," said fan Wang Xiaotian.

Shanghai last witnessed an F1 race in 2019, before Covid and China's travel restrictions put a halt to almost all major international sport in the country.

Tickets for the action-packed Formula One weekend â€“ which begins with Friday morning practice, sees a sprint race on Saturday and ends with the grand prix on Sunday â€“ sold out within minutes of going on sale in January.

Ma Qinghua, the first Chinese to drive an F1 car when he took part in a 2012 practice session, said the sport's return will have a "very good impact", especially on younger fans who did not have the chance to see their heroes in the flesh during the pandemic.

"This group of people are very much anticipating the chance to witness a race personally," Ma, a pioneer of China's motorsport industry.

It was almost exactly two years ago, at the height of the city's lockdown, that the Shanghai circuit became the site of a makeshift 13,000-bed Covid hospital.

That was just a few weeks after Zhou had his first grand prix drive in Bahrain, finishing 10th, but the pandemic delayed 24-year-old Zhou's home F1 debut until this week.

Even though he is unlikely to challenge for the podium, Zhou is desperate to put on a Shanghai show.

"I can't wait to give it my all, share the passion with our entire team trackside and at home, and start a new chapter of Chinese motorsport together with the crowd," Zhou said.

"It's an opportunity to inspire and pave the path for future generations being interested in the sport.

"My country loves racing and has been waiting for this moment for years." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Caitlin Clark, who smashed records on and off the court in a dazzling US college career, was selected first in the WNBA draft on Monday amid expectations she will have a transformative effect on women's professional basketball.

Clark, 22, was taken first overall by the Indiana Fever â€“ a team that hasn't been to the playoffs since 2016 and that had the second-lowest attendance in the league in 2023 with an average of 4,066 fans per game.

With the University of Iowa star joining last year's overall top pick Aliyah Boston in Indiana, however, all that seems set to change.

In anticipation of her selection, the WNBA has already scheduled 36 of the Fever's 40 games next season for national television.

Even before the draft the Fever had begun selling a limited amount of single-game tickets, betting that the basketball-mad Midwestern state of Indiana would be prime territory for "Clark-mania."

Seats for games against Connecticut and Los Angeles sold out within hours of going on sale.

Clark, whose fame is built on a foundation of on-court excellence that saw her eclipse Pete Maravich's 54-year-old all-time college basketball scoring record, was cheered by fans at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, who packed the draft venue in anticipation that she would lead a star-studded WNBA class.

She admitted she felt anxious as the minutes ticked by before the Fever announced their selection.

"I've dreamed of this moment since I was in second grade and it's taken a lot of hard work, a lot of ups and downs," Clark said.

"I always just believed in myself... I told my mom before this, you know, I earned it, and that's why I'm so proud of it." (AFP)]]>
