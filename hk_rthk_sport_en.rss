    McIlroy dismisses LIV report, pledges future to PGA

    <![CDATA[Rory McIlroy rubbished reports linking him with a move to LIV Golf on Tuesday, vowing to remain a PGA Tour player for the rest of his career.

A report in Britain said McIlroy – a long-time critic of the upstart Saudi circuit – was poised to switch to LIV in a staggering deal worth US$850 million.

But the four-time major winner from Northern Ireland swiftly debunked the rumors in an interview with NBC's Golf Central on Tuesday.

"I honestly don't know how these things get started," McIlroy said.

"I've never been offered a number from LIV, I've never contemplated going to LIV. Again, I think I've made it clear over the past two years that I don't think it's something for me."

LIV has signed a slew of golf's elite since its formation, with Spanish star Jon Rahm the last big name to make the switch last December in a move reported to be worth around $500 million.

McIlroy, who has been increasingly conciliatory towards LIV professionals in recent months amid ongoing negotiations with the PGA Tour over a merger, reiterated that he bore no ill will to golfers who have joined the circuit.

"One of the things I think I've realized over the past two years is that people can make their own decisions on whatever they think is best for themselves," McIlroy said.

"Who are we to judge them for that? But personally for me my future is here on the PGA Tour and it's never been any different.

"I'm here today and playing a PGA Tour next week and I'll play the PGA Tour for the rest of my career."

McIlroy was speaking ahead of this week's RBC Heritage in South Carolina where he is among a star-studded field taking part following last week's Masters at Augusta. (AFP)]]>

    PSG punish 10-man Barca, Dortmund sink Atletico

    <![CDATA[Kylian Mbappe struck twice as Paris Saint-Germain battled back to beat 10-man Barcelona 4-1 and book a place in the Champions League semi-finals with a 6-4 aggregate triumph on Tuesday, while Borussia Dortmund fought back to beat Atletico Madrid.

PSG's hopes of going all the way in Europe's elite club competition for the first time hung in the balance after they lost 3-2 at home to Barca in the first leg of their quarter-final last week.

But they seized the opportunity given to them in Catalonia after Ronald Araujo's red card left Barcelona to play over an hour with 10 men, allowing Luis Enrique's team to go on and win 4-1 on the night and 6-4 on aggregate.

PSG were rampant with the extra player, as Ousmane Dembele again stood out against his old team by scoring the equaliser on the night and winning a penalty which Kylian Mbappe converted to put PSG ahead in the tie.

In between, the outstanding Vitinha – who had already scored in the first leg – netted with a brilliant strike from outside the box, and Mbappe made sure of the win late on to spark wild celebrations in the away contingent at Montjuic.

The final scoreline was identical to that on their last visit to Barcelona in February 2021, when Mbappe hit a hat-trick in the first leg of a last-16 tie they eventually won 5-2 on aggregate.

But the manner of this victory surely finally exorcises the ghost of their humiliating collapse in Barcelona in 2017, when they won 4-0 at home in the first leg only to lose 6-1 in the return in a stunning implosion.

Borussia Dortmund beat Atletico Madrid 4-2 in their quarter-final second leg, securing a 5-4 aggregate victory and a first Champions League semi-final since 2013.

Trailing 2-1 from the first leg, goals from Julian Brandt and Ian Maatsen had Dortmund 2-0 up at half-time.

Visiting coach Diego Simeone made three changes at half-time including bringing on Angel Correa and his energy told immediately, Mats Hummels conceding a poor own goal before the Argentine netted to put Atletico back ahead in the tie.

But those goals brought a sluggish Dortmund back to life, with Niclas Fuellkrug and Marcel Sabitzer each scoring in a three-minute period to send the Bundesliga club through. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Eiffel Tower's countdown clock to the Paris 2024 Olympics turned to 100 days on Tuesday as preparations for the Games entered the final straight.

The Olympic torch was lit in ancient Olympia earlier in the day. It will reach France on May 8 in the port city of Marseille, after a journey on the three-masted Belem ship.

All permanent infrastructures for the Games are now ready, and the building of temporary sites has started in Paris, notably on the Place de la Concorde.

Organisers will count on the flame relay across France for the mood to swing in the country as the July 26-August 11 Games approach.

Last month, a poll showed that, in France, 57 percent of people felt little or no enthusiasm for the Paris Games.

Paris 2024 posters were displayed in metro stations on Tuesday and some landmark monuments paid tribute to the upcoming Games, while the stairs leading up to the Sacre Coeur basilica were being painted with the Games' colours. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Two years ago the Shanghai International Circuit hosted a Covid hospital, but this weekend it will stage Formula One once more as the sport returns to China for the first time since the pandemic.

Adding to the excitement of fans, they will see Shanghai native Zhou Guanyu drive at his home track in Formula One for the first time.

"I'm extremely excited, in these 5,000 years of [Chinese] history there has only been one Zhou Guanyu," said fan Wang Xiaotian.

Shanghai last witnessed an F1 race in 2019, before Covid and China's travel restrictions put a halt to almost all major international sport in the country.

Tickets for the action-packed Formula One weekend – which begins with Friday morning practice, sees a sprint race on Saturday and ends with the grand prix on Sunday – sold out within minutes of going on sale in January.

Ma Qinghua, the first Chinese to drive an F1 car when he took part in a 2012 practice session, said the sport's return will have a "very good impact", especially on younger fans who did not have the chance to see their heroes in the flesh during the pandemic.

"This group of people are very much anticipating the chance to witness a race personally," Ma, a pioneer of China's motorsport industry.

It was almost exactly two years ago, at the height of the city's lockdown, that the Shanghai circuit became the site of a makeshift 13,000-bed Covid hospital.

That was just a few weeks after Zhou had his first grand prix drive in Bahrain, finishing 10th, but the pandemic delayed 24-year-old Zhou's home F1 debut until this week.

Even though he is unlikely to challenge for the podium, Zhou is desperate to put on a Shanghai show.

"I can't wait to give it my all, share the passion with our entire team trackside and at home, and start a new chapter of Chinese motorsport together with the crowd," Zhou said.

"It's an opportunity to inspire and pave the path for future generations being interested in the sport.

"My country loves racing and has been waiting for this moment for years." (AFP)]]>

    Basketball phenom Clark selected first in WNBA draft

    <![CDATA[Caitlin Clark, who smashed records on and off the court in a dazzling US college career, was selected first in the WNBA draft on Monday amid expectations she will have a transformative effect on women's professional basketball.

Clark, 22, was taken first overall by the Indiana Fever – a team that hasn't been to the playoffs since 2016 and that had the second-lowest attendance in the league in 2023 with an average of 4,066 fans per game.

With the University of Iowa star joining last year's overall top pick Aliyah Boston in Indiana, however, all that seems set to change.

In anticipation of her selection, the WNBA has already scheduled 36 of the Fever's 40 games next season for national television.

Even before the draft the Fever had begun selling a limited amount of single-game tickets, betting that the basketball-mad Midwestern state of Indiana would be prime territory for "Clark-mania."

Seats for games against Connecticut and Los Angeles sold out within hours of going on sale.

Clark, whose fame is built on a foundation of on-court excellence that saw her eclipse Pete Maravich's 54-year-old all-time college basketball scoring record, was cheered by fans at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, who packed the draft venue in anticipation that she would lead a star-studded WNBA class.

She admitted she felt anxious as the minutes ticked by before the Fever announced their selection.

"I've dreamed of this moment since I was in second grade and it's taken a lot of hard work, a lot of ups and downs," Clark said.

"I always just believed in myself... I told my mom before this, you know, I earned it, and that's why I'm so proud of it." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Nearly 100 days before the 2024 Paris Games open, the Olympic flame will be lit in ancient Olympia Tuesday for a torch relay stretching from the Acropolis to French Polynesia.

For the first time since events for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Games had to be toned down due to the Covid-19 pandemic, spectators will be able to attend the torch relay events.

Some 600 dignitaries are expected at the ceremony on Tuesday, headed by Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou and International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach.

The ritual will see actresses in the role of ancient priestesses coaxing the Olympic flame into life with the help of a parabolic polished mirror in Olympia, southwestern Greece, where the Games were born in 776 BC.

The ceremony is conducted at the ruins of the 2,600-year-old Temple of Hera, and sets off the Olympic torch relay that marks the countdown for each Games.

The first relay runner will be Greece's 2020 Olympics rowing champion Stefanos Ntouskos.

The Hellenic Olympic Committee confirmed Monday that retired French swimmer Laure Manaudou, who won her first gold medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics, will follow Ntouskos as France's first torchbearer in Olympia.

The Olympic flame will be handed over to Paris 2024 organisers in a ceremony at the all-marble Panathenaic Stadium, site of the first modern Olympic Games of 1896, on April 26.

On April 27, the flame will begin its journey to France on board the 19th-century three-masted barque Belem, which was launched just weeks after the 1896 Athens Games.

France's last surviving three-mast steel-hulled boat, it is expected to arrive in Marseille on May 8.

Ten thousand torchbearers will then carry the flame across 64 French territories.

It will travel through 400 towns and dozens of tourist attractions during its 12,000-kilometre journey through mainland France and overseas French territories in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean and Pacific.

On July 26 it will form the centrepiece of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony on the river Seine -- the first time it has not been held in the Games' main stadium. (AFP)]]>

    Palmer scores four as Chelsea hit Everton for six

    <![CDATA[Cole Palmer scored four goals to put Chelsea within touching distance of the Premier League's top six after a 6-0 win over Everton on Monday.

The England international has been a shining light in an otherwise disappointing campaign for the Blues and moved level with Manchester City striker Erling Haaland's 20 Premier League goals in the race for the Golden Boot.

Despite an eight-game unbeaten Premier League run, Chelsea remain in ninth but are now just three points adrift of sixth-placed Newcastle with a game in hand to come.

A demoralising defeat leaves Everton still perilously placed just two points above the relegation zone.

The visitors were dealt a blow before kick-off as Dominic Calvert-Lewin missed out due to a hamstring injury.

His deputy Beto spurned a glorious chance to open the scoring when he somehow turned over Seamus Coleman's cross from point-blank range.

Palmer was not so forgiving at the other end as he made another case to be crowned as the Premier League's player of the year.

Palmer nutmegged Jarrad Branthwaite before exchanging a neat one-two with Jackson and curling home from the edge of the box to open the scoring.

With Enzo Fernandez absent due to injury, Pochettino flanked Palmer and Jackson with Madueke and Mykhailo Mudryk for the first time in his starting line-up.

Everton failed to live with the sharpness of the front four and Palmer was left with an easy task to head in his second after Jordan Pickford denied Jackson from a Mudryk cross.

The England goalkeeper then had a moment to forget as he gifted possession to Palmer, who nonchalantly chipped his international teammate on his weaker right foot from midway inside the Everton half.

In contrast to Palmer, Jackson has had an inconsistent first season at Chelsea but produced an excellent touch and finish to fire in his 13th goal of the season on the stroke of half-time.

Palmer then converted a penalty on the hour mark to make it nine out of nine successful spot-kicks this season to take his tally for the season in both Chelsea and City colours to 25.

Academy graduate Alfie Gilchrist had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he blasted in the sixth after Pickford parried Ben Chilwell's effort. (AFP)]]>

    England spin great Derek Underwood dead at 78

    <![CDATA[Derek Underwood, the most successful spin bowler in England's Test cricket history, has died at the age of 78, his former county Kent announced on Monday.

Underwood took 297 wickets in 86 Tests with his distinctive brand of brisk left-arm spin and was noted for being particularly effective on uncovered pitches, which were in use for much of a 24-year first-class career that ran from 1963 to 1987.

He famously bowled England to a Test victory over arch-rivals Australia at The Oval in 1968 on such a surface, taking 7-50 when a draw had seemed inevitable.

Underwood made his England debut as a 21-year-old in 1966 and played his last Test in 1982.

Together with outstanding wicketkeeper Alan Knott, he formed a celebrated combination for Kent and England.

Both Underwood, affectionately nicknamed 'Deadly', and Knott might have achieved even more success for England had they not each been involved in Kerry Packer's breakaway World Series Cricket of the late 1970s and a rebel tour of South Africa in 1982.

Even so, Underwood's tally of Test wickets is 42 more than the next highest by another England spinner, Graeme Swann.

After his playing career was over, Underwood served as president of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the owners of London's Lord's Cricket Ground, for an annual term in 2009.

"Derek was an outstanding contributor to both Kent and England, winning trophies for club and country and etching his name in the history books forevermore," said Kent chair Simon Phillip in a club statement.

"Watching Derek weave his unique magic on a wet wicket was a privilege for all who were able to witness it. His induction into the ICC (International Cricket Council) Hall of Fame shows the esteem in which he was held in world cricket.

"An advocate for growing our game worldwide whilst protecting our sport's rich heritage, Derek also made substantial contributions off the field as well as on it, and he will be sorely missed by everyone at Kent Cricket." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong badminton player Angus Ng on Monday acknowledged he was unable to qualify for this year's Paris Olympics, adding he was thankful for the support he had received over the years. 

Ng, 29, was trying to make his third Olympic Games, having taken part in the men's singles competition in the past two tournaments in Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro. 

In a social media post, he said he took part in many qualifying tournaments and had tried to overcome many challenges on the road to Paris.

"Sometimes in life, you don't get rewarded correspondingly even though you've tried your best. Perhaps it is what it is in life," Ng wrote, while apologising for disappointing his "true fans".

But not only did Ng thank his family, friends and fans, he was also thankful for his "haters" for toughening him up.

Ng said "their mean comments", when he didn't play well, helped his sporting career and gave him resilience in life.

The player, who once ranked number six in the world, also said making the Olympics wasn't his only goal, and he would spend the rest of his career doing his best to brush up his resume.

Ng was caught up in a jersey controversy in Tokyo three years ago when some criticised him for wearing black. He ended up changing into new attire, and was knocked out in the group stages.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Chef de Mission for the Hong Kong, China delegation, Brian Stevenson, said he hopes to see Hong Kong athletes perform to the best of their abilities at the Olympic Games this year, adding he doesn't want to set specific expectations for the games.

Leading the delegation to Paris in July, Stevenson said the size of the team would be similar to the Tokyo Games, but the exact number of athletes wouldn’t be announced until after the qualifying process is over.

"We won't know until about June, or a little bit later than the middle of June, maybe even towards the end of June, because so many of the sports are still active at that time in the competitions as to who is going to go to the games, so we won't know exactly how many athletes we'll have," he said.

"In Tokyo, I think it was about 45 [athletes]. I would anticipate a low of just over 30 and a high of, in that range, with a caveat - if my rugby boys win in Monaco, well we've got a very large team of over 100!"

Stevenson also said he hopes to see the government continue its support of sports, adding that free broadcasting of the Olympics to Hongkongers would definitely encourage people to get involved in sporting activities.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Deputy Consul General at the French Consulate in Hong Kong and Macau, Marc Lamy, said preparations for the Paris Olympics are in full swing, with enhanced security measures and efficient transportation arrangements in place for the international sporting event.

With the opening ceremony set for July 26, Lamy said France is dedicated to ensuring maximum security, adding their previous experience in hosting large events has helped with their preparations.

"There will be more than more than 56,000 security personnel, including policemen, gendarmerie, including also private guards that will make sure that the security in the transportation, in the streets, on the sites, and around the sites will be completely and fully ensured," he said.

"The country and the government are completely committed for full security so people can really enjoy their time in France and be happy and discover not only the performances of the athletes, but have a good time when they are outside in the street and discover our beautiful cities and our beautiful Paris."

Lamy added France is committed to organising a sustainable and green games. 

"All the infrastructure, like the village for the athletes that will be built, after use it will become housing for the students and all the things like this," he said. 

"So [organisers have] been also very careful about how much money we spend to make sure and to reduce the carbon footprint during the games."]]>

    <![CDATA[The unexpected Oklahoma City Thunder clinched the Western Conference top seed ahead of the defending champion Denver Nuggets as the NBA regular season wrapped up on Sunday.

The youthful Thunder rolled past the playoff-bound Dallas Mavericks – who rested Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving among others – 135-86 to emerge from the trio of teams who went into the final day of action tied atop the West.

Thanks to the Thunder's edge in their head-to-head record, the Nuggets' 126-111 victory over the Grizzlies in Memphis wasn't enough and the Minnesota Timberwolves, who also had a chance, fell 125-106 to the Phoenix Suns.

The Suns snatched the sixth and final automatic playoff berth and will face the No. 3 Timberwolves again in the first round.

In New Orleans, superstar LeBron James scored 28 points with 11 rebounds and 17 assists in his 112th career triple-double to propel the Los Angeles Lakers to a 124-108 victory over the Pelicans and eighth place in the West.

The defeat dropped the Pelicans out of sixth place and they'll host the Lakers in the play-in tournament on Tuesday, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the seventh seed.

The Golden State Warriors, with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green resting, beat the Utah Jazz 123-116 to lock up the last play-in berth.

They'll play Tuesday against the Sacramento Kings, who cruised past Detroit 123-95, with the winner of that play-in game earning a shot at the loser of the Lakers-Pelicans contest for the final Western Conference playoff berth.

There was a bit less to settle in the East but the New York Knicks, fueled by 40 points from Jalen Brunson, edged the Chicago Bulls 120-119 in overtime to grab the second seed.

The Knicks leapfrogged into second place over the Milwaukee Bucks, who fell 113-88 to the Orlando Magic as Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo missed a third straight game with a leg injury.

The Magic, led by 26 points and 11 rebounds from Paolo Banchero, avoided the play-in tournament, clinching the fifth seed ahead of the Indiana Pacers.

The Pacers grabbed the sixth and final automatic playoff spot with an emphatic 157-115 victory over the Atlanta Hawks and booked a first-round clash with the Bucks.

The Boston Celtics, already assured of the top seed in the East, closed the regular season with a 64th victory, 132-122 over the Washington Wizards.

The Cleveland Cavaliers, who also had a shot at second place, fell to the Charlotte Hornets 120-110 and finished fourth. They will meet the Magic in the first round.

The Miami Heat, beaten by the Nuggets in last year's Finals, finished eighth after a 118-103 victory over the Toronto Raptors.

On Wednesday, the Heat will take on the Philadelphia 76ers, who rested star big man Joel Embiid in a 107-86 victory over the Brooklyn Nets – in the play-in.

The winner will advance to the playoffs and the loser will take on the winner of the play-in clash between Chicago and 10th-seeded Atlanta. (AFP)]]>

    Scheffler dominates back nine to win second Masters

    <![CDATA[World number one Scottie Scheffler captured his second Masters title on Sunday, dominating a back-nine shootout for a four-stroke victory at Augusta National.

Scheffler, who also took the green jacket in 2022, won a record US$3.6 million top prize after a drama-filled battle with fellow Americans Collin Morikawa and Max Homa and Sweden's Ludvig Aberg, who made an impressive major debut.

Scheffler birdied three of the last six holes to fire a four-under par 68 and finish 72 holes over the iconic 7,555-yard layout on 11-under 277 with Aberg shooting 69 to finish second on 281.

Two-time major winner Morikawa had a closing 74 to share third on 284 with Homa and England's Tommy Fleetwood.

"Did my best to stay calm out there and to be patient," Scheffler said. "They played well out there and I was fortunate to hold them off until the end."

Scheffler matched Tiger Woods as the only players to win the Masters twice while atop the world rankings.

He also became the fourth-youngest multiple Masters winner at age 27 behind Woods, Jack Nicklaus and the late Seve Ballesteros.

Scheffler, who hasn't played a round over par since last August, has the second-fewest Masters starts for any two-time winner with five. Only Horton Smith needed fewer, taking two of the first three Augusta titles in the 1930s.

Well back were second-ranked Rory McIlroy, third-ranked defending champion Jon Rahm and 15-time major champion Woods.

McIlroy, who needs only a Masters victory to complete a career grand slam, fired a 73 to finish on 292.

Spaniard Rahm fired a 76 to finish on 297.

Woods shot 77 to finish on 16-over 304, last among 60 players to make the cut in his worst 72-hole Masters effort. He said he plans to play the year's other three majors. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Bayer Leverkusen lifted the Bundesliga title for the first time in their 120-year history on Sunday, a 5-0 victory over Werder Bremen breaking Bayern Munich's 11-year stranglehold on the German top flight.

Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen knew victory would secure the title with five games to spare, but there were no signs of nerves in a dominant performance.

A hat-trick from Florian Wirtz and goals from Victor Boniface and Granit Xhaka extended their unbeaten run to a stunning 43 games in all competitions.

Leverkusen's maiden title, coming after five second-place finishes in their history, keeps their dream of a remarkable treble alive while shedding their unwanted 'Neverkusen' nickname for good.

With 10 minutes to go, the long-suffering fans began making their way to the sidelines and a few jumped the gun, storming the pitch with the match still ongoing.

Leverkusen's players ushered the fans back and some obliged, albeit briefly, with the stands swiftly emptying on the 90-minute mark as tearful fans made their way onto the grass to celebrate with the players.

Leverkusen are now on 79 points – the best tally after 29 games in German league history – and are 16 clear of second-placed Bayern and third-placed Stuttgart. (AFP)]]>

    Man City in charge as Arsenal and Liverpool both lose

    <![CDATA[Aston Villa struck twice late on through Ollie Watkins and Leon Bailey to inflict a huge blow on Arsenal's Premier League title challenge with a 2-0 win at the Emirates on Sunday as Liverpool also stumbled in a shock 1-0 defeat to Crystal Palace.

Manchester City were the big winners of the day as the defending champions remain two points clear at the top of the table with six games remaining.

Arsenal had taken 31 from a possible 33 Premier League points in 2024 prior to Villa's visit, but former Gunners boss Unai Emery derailed his old club's charge towards the title.

Mikel Arteta's men were left to rue not making the most of their first half superiority as ex-Arsenal goalkeeper Emi Martinez produced a brilliant stop to deny Leandro Trossard the opener.

However, Villa had shown their teeth as Watkins and Youri Tielemans struck the woodwork before snatching all three points.

Bailey ghosted in to meet Lucas Digne's low cross six minutes from time.

And Watkins then moved to within one of Erling Haaland's 20 in the race for the Golden Boot with a sumptuous finish on a counter-attack from an Arsenal corner.

Villa's victory puts them in pole position for a place in next season's Champions League as they move three points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham.

It was a similar story for Liverpool at Anfield as Jurgen Klopp's men appear to have run out of steam at the business end of the campaign.

The Reds have now won just three of their last eight games in all competitions as a glorious goodbye for Klopp is at risk of fizzling out.

Liverpool had not lost in any competition at Anfield for 14 months prior to Atalanta's 3-0 rout in the Europa League on Thursday and suffered their first Premier League defeat at home since October 2022.

Eberechi Eze gave Palace a deserved lead on 14 minutes and only an incredible goal-line clearance by Andy Robertson denied Jean-Philippe Mateta a second.

Liverpool were much improved after the break but were guilty of missing a number of big chances.

Darwin Nunez fired straight at Dean Henderson, while Curtis Jones, Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota should all have salvaged at least a point.

"I am not dumb," said Klopp on the ramifications for the title race.

"The answer is pretty easy: if we play like we did in the first half, why should we win the league? If you play like in the second half, we can win football games.

"So if we can win football games then we will see how many we can win. We have to be around when the other guys now struggle, if they struggle."

However, the advantage has swung firmly into City's favour as they look to become the first side to ever win four consecutive English top-flight titles.

West Ham's hopes of a fourth consecutive season in European competition were hit by a 2-0 home defeat to Fulham.

Andreas Pereira scored both goals for the Cottagers, who move up to 12th. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Stefanos Tsitsipas completed a Monte Carlo Masters trophy hat-trick on Sunday, holding off Casper Ruud 6-1, 6-4 in a display of "ruthless" tennis.

The 12th-ranked Greek, who will return to the top 10 on Monday, also won the title in the principality in 2021 and 2022.

Tsitsipas said a chat with his team the night before the final gave him the spark he needed against his Norwegian opponent.

"I told them I would go out and play fearless tennis and that's what I did. I couldn't let the team down. I wanted to make the most of it," said the 25-year-old who had stunned Australian Open winner and world number two Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals.

"I showed some unbelievable, ruthless tennis."

Tsitsipas produced 30 winners to the 20 of Ruud who had reached the final with victory over world number one Novak Djokovic on Saturday.

He is the fifth man to win three or more Monte Carlo titles, joining Rafael Nadal (11) and Bjorn Borg, Thomas Muster and Ilie Nastase who won three apiece.

The Greek struck first with a break in the third game of the opening set, then saved three break points to lead 3-1.

Tsitsipas earned a double break for 4-1 and claimed the set as Ruud double-faulted after 36 minutes.

In the second set, Tsitsipas got out of trouble in a 13-minute game, saving three break points at 3-3 after leading 40-0.

He claimed the title three games later on a first match point, a forehand winner down the line.

Tsitsipas explained that his 98-minute victory was more special than his first two title triumphs and cited a no-nonsense attitude heading onto the court.

"This is amazing, I want to thank family, friends and those who made this moment possible," he said.

"(Completing) the trinity (hat-trick) is even more special than the first two." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Zhang Weili beat Yan Xiaonan in Las Vegas on Saturday to retain the straweight belt at UFC 300, the first-time two Chinese mixed martial arts fighters have faced off for a UFC championship belt.

Zhang looked like she had almost ended the fight in the first round with a rear naked choke, but her 34-year-old opponent survived until the bell, looking unsteady as she got back to her feet.

Yan had some success on her feet, but Zhang brought the fight to the mat as often as possible, dominating the grappling exchanges en route to a unanimous decision victory.

“She bounced back very quickly,” Zhang said through an interpreter.

On the same card, Brazil's Alex Pereira pulled off a stunning first-round knockout victory over Jamahal Hill to retain the UFC light heavyweight title.

Pereira waved off what looked to be a low blow from Hill before landing a left hook that sent the American sprawling backwards onto the canvas. He then pounced to rain down blows and force the stoppage at the 3:14 mark of the first round.

"I told everyone the whole time, he's a strong guy, I cannot go away from my strategy, and that's exactly what I was doing ... I was gauging the distance and the timing, and everything went perfectly," Pereira said in a post-fight interview in the cage.

Hill had won the title in January 2023, but an injury suffered playing basketball forced him to vacate in July and decorated kickboxer Pereira, a former UFC middleweight champ, took over the belt with a second-round knockout of Jiri Prochazka in November.

After coming through the fight relatively unscathed, Pereira said he would like to fight on the upcoming UFC card in Brazil in May, and that he had sustained no damage against Hill.

In perhaps the most thrilling finish on the card, Max Holloway folded Justin Gaethje with a thunderous right hand to win their lightweight fight by knockout with one second left on the clock after a tremendous five-round battle. (Reuters/AP)]]>

    Scheffler leads Masters as Woods wilts at Augusta

    <![CDATA[Scottie Scheffler birdied his final hole to emerge from a packed leaderboard and grab a one-shot lead over Collin Morikawa after the third round of the Masters while Tiger Woods endured his worst major round as a professional on Saturday.

Scheffler, who used a back-nine eagle to get his round back on track, carded a one-under-par 71 on a firm and fast Augusta National layout to reach seven under on the week and in position to win a second Masters.

With a win, Scheffler would become the 18th player to win the Masters multiple times and the first to accomplish the feat since Bubba Watson in 2014.

"Being patient out there I think is really important," said Scheffler. "Especially on a day like today. It was a frustrating day to be playing this golf course. It was so challenging."

Morikawa, who is seeking the third leg of the career Grand Slam of golf's four majors, began his day with three consecutive was alone in second place after a three-under-par 69 that was one shot off the day's low round.

Max Homa (73), who along with LIV Golf's Bryson DeChambeau (75) held a share of the halfway lead with Scheffler, was a further shot back in third while Ludvig Aberg (70) of Sweden was three shots off the lead in his major championship debut.

Scheffler had dropped out of the lead after a shaky start to the back nine where he followed a double-bogey at the par-four 10th with a bogey at the 11th.

But an unflustered Scheffler joined Morikawa atop the leaderboard with a 31-foot eagle putt at the par-five 13th where his approach shot looked ready to settle some 10 feet from the hole before it suddenly gathered speed rolled away.

Woods, fresh off his Masters record-setting 24th made cut, began his third round seven shots behind the leaders and hoping his injury-ravaged body would hold up and allow him to move into contention.

But Woods looked worn out from playing 23 holes on Friday and suffered an unwanted personal milestone with a 10-over-par 82 that tied the day's highest round.

"Just hit the ball in all the places that I know I shouldn't hit it," said Woods. "And I missed a lot of putts. Easy, makeable putts." (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Manchester City moved to the top of the Premier League as lowly Luton were eased aside 5-1 at the Etihad, while Newcastle thrashed Tottenham 4-0 on Saturday.

Amid a gruelling schedule, Pep Guardiola could hardly have wished for a kinder fixture in between the two legs of his side's Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid.

Guardiola made six changes from a thrilling 3-3 draw in the Spanish capital on Tuesday and City seemed set for a stress-free afternoon from the moment they opened the scoring after just two minutes.

Erling Haaland's shot deflected off the unfortunate Daiki Hashioka into his own net.

Yet the floodgates refused to open as the English champions had to wait until after the hour mark before making the points safe when Mateo Kovacic smashed in Julian Alvarez's cross at the edge of the box.

Haaland scored five goals when the sides met in the FA Cup in February.

The Norwegian had to settle for just one time this time when he scored from the penalty spot for his 20th Premier League goal of the season.

Ross Barkley netted a late consolation for Luton but they have just five games left to save their top-flight status.

Jeremy Doku fired into the far corner after jinking through the Luton defence before Josko Gvardiol scored his second goal in a week after opening his City account in Madrid.

Victory takes City two points clear of Arsenal and Liverpool, who both have a game in hand, and are in action on Sunday.

Liverpool host Crystal Palace at Anfield looking to bounce back from their shock Europa League defeat to Atalanta.

Arsenal entertain Aston Villa, who moved back into the top four without kicking a ball on Saturday thanks to Tottenham's trouncing at St James' Park.

"The only way is to win our games and put the pressure," said Guardiola. "We have done our job and that is what we have to do."

Alexander Isak scored twice, while Anthony Gordon and Fabian Schar were also on target as the Magpies moved up to sixth and kept their slim chances of Champions League football next season alive.

Newcastle are 10 points adrift of Tottenham and Villa with six games remaining but have the far easier run-in.

"We've just got to keep doing our bit which is trying to win every game," said Newcastle boss Eddie Howe.

"We're hopefully returning to somewhere near our best and we've got to keep heading in that direction."

Manchester United missed the chance to move back above Newcastle after a 2-2 draw at Bournemouth.

Twice the Cherries led through Dominic Solanke and Justin Kluivert, but Bruno Fernandes struck twice to salvage a point for the Red Devils.

Bournemouth thought they had the chance to win the game deep into stoppage time when referee Tony Harrington pointed to the spot.

But VAR intervened to determine Willy Kambwala's foul on Ryan Christie had taken place just outside the box.

At the bottom of the table, Nottingham Forest edged one point clear of the bottom three after a thrilling 2-2 draw against Wolves.

Matheus Cunha struck twice for the visitors at the City Ground to deny Forest a vital three points after goals from Morgan Gibbs White and Danilo had put them 2-1 in front.

Brentford's first win in 10 games pulled the Bees seven points clear of the drop zone as Ollie Arblaster's own goal and Frank Onyeka earned a 2-0 victory over Sheffield United.

Burnley's chances of survival are fading fast after a 1-1 draw at home to Brighton left them still second bottom, six points adrift of safety. (AFP)]]>
