    <![CDATA[Donovan Mitchell tossed in a game-high 29 points and the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers pulled even in the Eastern Conference second round by beating the Boston Celtics 118-94 in Game 2 on Thursday night.

Mitchell had six points at halftime, but scored 16 in the third quarter and seven in the fourth. He was 10 of 19 from the field, including 5 of 7 from 3-point territory. Mitchell tossed in a game-high 33 points when Boston earned a 120-95 victory in Game 1 on Tuesday.

Cleveland led by 12 after three quarters, and pushed the lead to 25 after a Caris LeVert three-point play with 4:58 remaining. Boston coach Joe Mazzulla pulled his starters off the court at that point.

Despite being in foul trouble for much of the second half, Cleveland's Evan Mobley had 21 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. LeVert [21], Darius Garland [14], Isaac Okoro [12] and Max Strus [12] also scored in double figures for the Cavaliers.

Jayson Tatum had 25 points, seven rebounds and six assists for the Celtics, who shot 8 of 35 from 3-point territory. Jaylen Brown added 19 points for Boston, but was 0 for 6 on 3-pointers.

The series will shift to Cleveland for Game 3 on Saturday.

Cleveland center Jarrett Allen missed his fifth straight game with a rib injury. The Celtics were without center Kristaps Porzingis, who has missed the last three games because of a right calf injury.

The Celtics led by nine early, but Cleveland had a nine-point lead, 30-21, after LeVert capped an 11-0 run by making a layup with 58.3 remaining in the first quarter. The Cavaliers had a 30-24 edge after 12 minutes.

Boston owned an eight-point lead late in the second quarter, but Cleveland closed the quarter on an 11-3 run to tie it at 54 at halftime.

The Cavaliers outscored the Celtics 36-24 in the third and had a 90-78 lead when Mitchell made a 3-pointer that just beat the buzzer at the end of the quarter. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Leverkusen reach Europa League final after Roma draw extends unbeaten run

Bayer Leverkusen staged a stunning late comeback to move into the Europa League final with a 2-2 draw at home against AS Roma on Thursday as they won 4-2 on aggregate and set the longest unbeaten run in all competitions including European matches.

Bundesliga champions Leverkusen, who have also reached this month's German Cup final as they chase a treble, played their 49th match without defeat to surpass Benfica's record set from 1963–65 but they had to battle for the second leg draw.

Xabi Alonso's side, who have 40 wins in their unbeaten run, will face Italian side Atalanta in the May 22 final in Dublin.

It will be a third European final for Leverkusen, who won their only continental title when they lifted the UEFA Cup in 1988 and lost in the 2002 Champions League showpiece.

Roma knew they had a mountain to climb after losing the first leg 2-0 at home but they remained composed in an evenly contested match in which Leverkusen gradually seized control.

Leverkusen's Exequiel Palacios struck the post just before halftime, with the rebound deflecting off Roma goalkeeper Mile Svilar's back, but Evan Ndicka cleared the danger.

Svilar then made another acrobatic save just before the break, denying Amine Adli and then blocking the rebound.

Despite Leverkusen's pressure Roma took the lead with a penalty from Leandro Paredes just before halftime after Jonathan Tah fouled Sardar Azmoun. Paredes scored with another spot kick in the 66th minute after Adam Hlozek handled.

With eight minutes remaining, a Leverkusen corner confused the visiting defence, including the until then excellent Svilar, leading to defender Gianluca Mancini inadvertently deflecting the ball into his own net at the far post.

Late substitute Joseph Stanisic then secured Leverkusen's place in the record books deep into stoppage time with the equaliser after a skilful move into the box to delight the ecstatic home fans and leave battling Roma distraught. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Rafael Nadal battled into the second round of the Rome Open on Thursday after bouncing back from a set down to beat qualifier Zizou Bergs 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.

Clay court icon Nadal will face world number nine Hubert Hurkacz next as he continued his comeback from injury with a punishing match against his Belgian opponent which lasted nearly three hours.

Also on Nadal's side of the draw are last year's winner, world number four Daniil Medvedev, and the beaten finalist Holger Rune.

Nadal has in recent times been a shadow of the player who has won 22 Grand Slams in a storied career which has also brought a record 10 titles in Rome, his most recent in 2021.

The 37-year-old has struggled with injury, dropping down to 305 in the world rankings after missing almost all of last year.

He returned in April from another three-month lay-off with a second-round exit in Barcelona before reaching the last 16 in Madrid last week.

He showed glimpses of his old self against Bergs who is ranked 108 in the world and is an eight-time title winner on the Challenger tour.

Outsider Bergs, 24, had in previous tournaments taken sets off high-profile players like Stefanos Tsitsipas and last year's losing Rome finalist Holger Rune, and he pushed his illustrious rival all the way.

The big-hitting Belgian briefly looked like he might win the biggest match of his career to date before Nadal fought back to take a hard-fought victory. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Jalen Brunson shrugged off injury to spark a sensational second-half fightback as the New York Knicks battled past the Indiana Pacers 130-121 to take a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Wednesday.

New York talisman Brunson gave his team a huge scare after suffering a foot injury in the first quarter which forced him to sit out the remainder of the half at Madison Square Garden.

Indiana exploited Brunson's absence to open up a 10-point advantage by half-time and were soon 12 points up in the third quarter after an early Andrew Nembhard layup.

But a limping Brunson – who returned at the start of the third quarter – led a stunning rally as the Knicks outscored Indiana 36-18 in the third to take a 99-91 lead into the fourth quarter.

The Knicks then dug deep to hold onto their advantage in the fourth, outscoring the Pacers 31-30 to close out a famous victory.

Brunson finished with 29 points and five assists while Donte DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby came up big with 28 points apiece.

Josh Hart added 19 points with 15 rebounds while Isaiah Hartenstein was huge defensively, with 12 rebounds, eight assists and 14 points.

The victory came at a cost though for the Knicks, who were already missing injured first-choice players Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic.

As well as the injury to Brunson on Wednesday, the Knicks saw another player injured with Anunoby limping out of the game in the third quarter with a hamstring problem.

Somehow the Knicks hung on to edge past the Pacers, with Brunson pouring in 14 fourth quarter points and DiVincenzo adding eight points including two crucial three-pointers that helped keep Indiana at arm's length.

Tyrese Haliburton led Indiana's scorers with 34 points while Nembhard finished with 15 points and Pascal Siakam 14. Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's Lo Wai-fung has made history by becoming the territory's first taekwondo athlete to make the Olympics. 

He's headed to Paris this summer in the under 68kg class because an opponent he lost to in a qualifying tournament in March was disqualified. 

The Taekwondo Association said originally, only the two athletes who made the final of the Asian qualifier would reach the Olympics. 

But Lo, 22, is now taking the spot because Ali Reza Abbasi from the Refugee Olympic Team was deemed ineligible.

Both the male and female tournaments have four weight categories, with 16 fighters in each weight class.

The Olympic taekwondo competition begins on August 7.]]>

    Nuggets' Jokic scoops third NBA MVP award

    <![CDATA[Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic was named NBA Most valuable Player for the third time in four seasons on Wednesday.

The 29-year-old Serbian star, who won the award in 2021 and 2022, finished runner-up in the voting in 2023 but had the satisfaction of leading the Nuggets to a first NBA title.

This season he averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists in the regular season and beat out Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks in final voting for the award.

He became the second player, after Oscar Robertson, to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 600 assists in a season.

His 25 triple-doubles and 68 double-doubles were both second in the league.

Jokic enters elite territory with a third MVP crown. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six MVPs are the most ever. Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won five apiece and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James four.

Jokic joins Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson as three-time winners after earning 79 first-placed votes compared to 15 for Gilgeous-Alexander and four for Doncic.

Behind Jokic, the 57-25 Nuggets matched the franchise high for victories in a season – although they were tied for best record in the West with Oklahoma City and ended up with the second seed.

Whether Jokic will be able to combine an MVP award and the title this season remains to be seen.

The Nuggets dropped the first two games of their Western Conference semi-final series to the Minnesota Timberwolves and face the tough task of trying to claw back on the Timberwolves' home court starting on Friday.

Jokic's victory marks the sixth straight season that the MVP award has gone to a player born outside the United States. The last US-born player to win was James Harden in 2018. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Real Madrid showed they remain Europe's comeback kings as Joselu's late double rescued them from the brink of elimination to reach the Champions League final with a dramatic 2-1 second-leg win over Bayern Munich at Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday.

A 4-3 aggregate victory sealed Real's progress to a remarkable sixth Champions League final in 10 years and they will bid for a record-extending 15th title against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley on June 1.

In a repeat of their spectacular semi-final comeback win over Manchester City two years ago, they saw their opponents take the lead after Bayern substitute Alphonso Davies fired home a stunning strike from a counter attack in the 68th minute.

But Joselu climbed off the bench to equalise following a calamitous error from Manuel Neuer in the 88th minute and, two minutes later, he shinned a second into the Bayern goal from a cross by Antonio Ruediger.

The effort was first ruled out for an apparent offside, but the goal was given following a VAR check.

"We've seen it a lot of times this season when it looked as though we're dead and buried ... it doesn’t matter who scores the goals but someone always manages it... that mentality of never say die," Jude Bellingham, who will play against his former club in the final, said.

Davies opened the scoring in spectacular fashion, cutting back on his right foot and curling an unstoppable bullet of a shot into the far corner.

But Real, who had dominated proceedings, piled on the pressure with Vinicius Jr tormenting the visitors down the left channel.

The Brazilian glided past Matthijs De Ligt and Joshua Kimmich effortlessly and created a number chances for himself and his team mates, who were denied several times by an inspired Neuer.

The Bayern keeper looked on course to be man of the match as he weathered a storm, but with minutes remaining he fumbled a Vinicius strike from the edge of the box to gift Joselu the equaliser.

The goal recharged a raucous Santiago Bernabeu under their spectacular new roof and two minutes later Real worked their European magic again, snatching a deserved winner that fired the Spanish giants into another final. (Reuters)]]>

    Olympic flame arrives on French soil for Paris Games

    <![CDATA[The Olympic flame arrived on French soil on Wednesday at the port of Marseille on board a 19th century ship in front of 150,000 spectators for a ceremony that posed a first major test for organisers ahead of the 2024 Paris Games.

Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Florent Manaudou carried the torch from the deck of the Belem, a three-masted vessel which had transported it from Greece.

Manaudou passed the torch to Paralympic champion sprinter Nantenin Keita, who handed it to French rapper Jul to light a cauldron.

As the Belem entered Marseille's Old Port surrounded by hundreds of small boats, planes from the Patrouille de France display team swooped overhead tracing the Olympic rings in the sky before they returned to paint the red, white and blue of the French flag in the air.

Fireworks also tore into the sky as the Belem docked after its 12-day voyage from Greece, where the flame was lit in Olympia on April 16.

The arrival of the flame marks the start of a 12,000-kilometre torch relay across France and its far-flung overseas territories.

Organisers are hoping the first public spectacle of the Games on French soil – just 79 days from an opening ceremony that will take place on the river Seine – will help build excitement after a row about ticket prices and concerns about security.

"It's something we've been waiting for for a very long time," chief organiser Tony Estanguet said on Monday, referring to the 100 years since Paris last staged the Games. "The Games are coming home."

France, which was also the host in 1900, sees itself at the heart of the modern Olympic movement after a French aristocrat, Pierre de Coubertin, revived the idea of the Games as practised by the Greeks until the 4th century BC.

After the Covid-hit edition in Tokyo in 2021 and the corruption-tainted Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016, the Paris Olympics are seen as an important moment for the sporting extravaganza.

In the background in Marseille, around 6,000 security forces are on duty at a time when the country is on its highest terror alert.

Other stars to take part in the parade, which continues in Marseille on Thursday, include NBA-winning basketball player Tony Parker and Ivory Coast football great Didier Drogba.

Extremely tight security will be a constant feature as the torch travels through more than 450 French towns and cities, and passes by dozens of tourist attractions including the Mont Saint Michel.

Around 200 members of the security forces are set to be positioned permanently around it, including an anti-terror SWAT team and anti-drone operatives.

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has referred to the risk of protests, including from far-left groups or environmental activists such as Extinction Rebellion.

Organisers have promised a "spectacular" and "iconic" Olympics, with much of the sport set to take place in temporary venues around the City of Light including at the Eiffel Tower and the Invalides.

In the absence of a much-feared security scare, the opening ceremony will take place in boats on the river Seine in a radical departure from past Games which have opened in the main stadium.

All of the major infrastructure has been completed with only two new permanent sporting venues built in a bid to reduce the financial cost and carbon emissions of the global extravaganza.

The idea of the torch rally harks back to the ancient Olympics when a sacred flame burned throughout the Games.

The Paris Olympics will run from July 26-August 11, followed by the Paralympics from August 28-September 8. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Jaylen Brown and Derrick White combined for 57 points as the Boston Celtics scored a dominant 120-95 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers to take a 1-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Tuesday.

The No.1 seeds, chasing a record-breaking 18th NBA championship, were always in control against their fourth-seeded Eastern Conference rivals, holding a double-digit lead through the second half to close out an emphatic win at the TD Garden.

Brown led the scoring for Boston with 32 points, six rebounds and two assists while the in-form White caught the eye with a 25-point haul that included seven three-pointers.

Jayson Tatum added 18 points but had an off-night shooting-wise, making just 7-of-19 from the field.

Donovan Mitchell led the scoring for Cleveland with 33 points, with Evan Mobley adding 17 and Darius Garland 14.

Brown said the Celtics' defense had laid the foundation for the win.

"It starts with defense, we wanted to set the tone on defense and we kept them under 100 [points]," Brown said.

Boston got off to a flying start, jumping out to an early 12-2 first quarter lead before a Cleveland rally saw them edge into a 23-21 lead after Mitchell's running three-pointer.

But Boston responded swiftly, reclaiming the lead immediately and never allowing Cleveland to get their noses in front thereafter.

After taking a 10-point lead into half-time, Boston kept the pressure up in the second half, stretching out to a 26-point lead in the fourth quarter as they romped to a comfortable win.

Game two in the series takes place in Boston on Thursday. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Jonas Vingegaard on Tuesday completed his first outing on a bicycle a month after a horrific crash and insisted he was hopeful of bidding for a third straight Tour de France crown.

"Of course I hope to be there at the start of the Tour de France," the Danish Visma-Lease a Bike rider said in a video posted on X, formerly Twitter.

"We don't know exactly how my shape and recovery will go but I will do everything I can to get there," he added of the June 29 to July 21 race.

The 27-year-old was hospitalised after suffering rib and collarbone fractures and sustaining lung damage in a mass crash on the Tour of the Basque Country on April 4.

"This is the first time back on the bike for me, riding outside and it's really nice to be finally able to ride like normal again and finally to be able to ride on the road is really amazing," Vingegaard said.

"I'm really looking forward to taking the next steps," he continued.

"I feel good, it's improving day by day. I still have some things to recover from but it's going better and better." (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Borussia Dortmund showed great composure to reach their third Champions League final after Mats Hummels' second-half goal earned the visitors a 1-0 victory against misfiring Paris St Germain for a deserved 2-0 aggregate win on Tuesday.

Hummels headed home from a corner five minutes into the second half to send the Germans, who won the title in 1997, into their first final in Europe's top club competition since 2013.

They will meet either 14-times champions Real Madrid or Bayern Munich, who clash at the Bernabeu on Wednesday after a 2-2 draw in the first leg, in the June 1 showdown at Wembley.

PSG hit the woodwork four times but failed to find the net as Kylian Mbappe, who is widely expected to leave the club at the end of the season, was a shadow of his usual brilliant self.

PSG, who entered the tie as favourites to reach their second final after they finished runners-up in 2020, made an aggressive start and Mbappe had their first chance in the seventh minute with a half-volley as the hosts piled on the pressure.

With Mbappe on the left flank and Goncalo Ramos as a lone striker, the France forward had some space out wide and the possibility to cut in and threaten the Dortmund goal.

The visitors, however, were composed and held firm. Their confidence grew and they had their first opportunity through Julian Ryerson, whose shot hit the side netting.

PSG were lucky the score on the night was level at halftime.

Luis Enrique's side stepped up a gear after the break with Warren Zaire Emery's shot hitting the outside of the post after Mbappe's attempt was deflected into his path by Ramos.

But Dortmund were more clinical as Hummels headed home from a corner five minutes after the interval to double the German side's advantage over the two legs.

Another Mbappe attempt was deflected onto the bar before Vitinha's powerful shot also hit the woodwork.

PSG's Ousmane Dembele was a constant threat after the hour mark but, just like the rest of the team, the France forward came more into the game far too late against a side who never lost their composure and fully deserve their place in the final. (Reuters)]]>

Gobert tied Hall of Fame big men Dikembe Mutombo and Ben Wallace for the most times winning the award in league history. He received 72 first-place votes and 433 points from a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters.

Gobert finished tied for sixth in blocks per game [2.1] and averaged 14 points and 12.9 rebounds in 76 games, his ninth straight season averaging a double-double.

But Gobert's standout achievement this season was anchoring the Timberwolves' stifling defense. Minnesota ranked first in the regular season in points allowed per game [106.5] and field goal percentage allowed [45 percent] and was top five in blocks [4.5] and rebounds [41.4].

Gobert, who is the first player in Timberwolves franchise history to win the award, won his first three Defensive Player of the Year awards with the Utah Jazz, earning the honor in 2018, 2019 and 2021. A three-time All-Star, Gobert has averaged 12,7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 2.1 blocks in 757 regular-season games during his 11-year career with the Jazz [2013-2022] and Timberwolves [2023-2024].

San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year on Monday, finished second in the voting. Wembanyama, the No. 1 pick in the 2023 draft, led the league in blocks per game [3.6] and also averaged 1.2 steals per game. He received 19 first-place votes and 245 points.

Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo finished third, Los Angeles Lakers forward Anthony Davis was fourth and New Orleans Pelicans forward Herbert Jones rounded out the top five. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Caitlin Clark’s first WNBA game in Los Angeles is being moved to a bigger stage.

The Los Angeles Sparks said on Tuesday that their home game against Clark and the Indiana Fever on May 24 is being moved from Walter Pyramid on the Long Beach State campus to Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.

Two other Sparks home games – May 26 against Dallas and June 5 against Minnesota – are also moving to Crypto.com Arena.

That's where the Sparks usually play all their games and it seats 19,067 for basketball games. Walter Pyramid seats 5,000. The games were originally moved to Long Beach because of construction at Crypto.com Arena.

"Women’s basketball is experiencing unprecedented viewership and attendance numbers so moving these games back to Crypto.com Arena provides us the ability to have more fans in the stands and have our players back to competing on their home floor," Sparks President Christine Monjer said.

The Sparks will still open the season on May 15 against Atlanta and play Washington on May 21 in Long Beach. (AP)]]>

    Forest lose appeal against EPL points deduction

    <![CDATA[Nottingham Forest have failed in their appeal against a four-point penalty for breaching Premier League financial rules, the English top flight announced on Tuesday.

The club were hit with the sanction by an independent commission in March for breaching the profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) threshold of £61 million (US$76 million) by £34.5 million.

Forest quickly indicated their intention to appeal but an independent appeal board panel has upheld the original penalty, which relates to a three-year assessment period ending with the 2022/23 season.

It means the 17th-placed club remain on 29 points, three points above the relegation zone, with two games left to play.

Forest had sought a reduction in the punishment because they felt the original commission should have taken the big-money sale of Brennan Johnson to Tottenham, two months after the end of the financial year ending 2023, into account as a mitigating factor.

They also felt the original commission had made a mistake by not wholly or partially suspending the sanction.

A release published on the Premier League website read: "The club argued that the independent commission committed an error in not treating its sale of a high-profile player shortly after the assessment period as a mitigating factor, and that it committed a further error in electing not to suspend some or all of the points deduction it imposed.

"Each of these grounds was rejected by the appeal board, which found the independent commission was entitled to immediately impose the sanction it did.

"The four-point deduction will therefore remain in place."

In November, Everton were docked 10 points for breaching PSR, reduced to six on appeal, while a separate two-point deduction imposed on the club for a separate breach is under appeal.

The Goodison Park club are now clear of relegation danger following a run of good results.

Premier League clubs are usually allowed maximum losses of £105 million over a three-year assessment period but this is reduced by £22 million per season for any seasons within the period spent in the Championship.

Forest, two time European champions, were promoted to the Premier League in May 2022, meaning two seasons of their three-year assessment period were as a second-tier club. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Jalen Brunson produced a scintillating fourth quarter performance as the New York Knicks edged past the Indiana Pacers 121-117 in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series opener on Monday.

Knicks talisman Brunson finished with 43 points, six rebounds and six assists to give New York the early advantage in their best-of-seven conference semi-final.

But it was his ice-cool performance down the stretch that swept New York to victory in front of 19,812 fans at an electric Madison Square Garden.

The Knicks guard rattled in 21 points in the fourth quarter to complete his fourth straight playoff game with 40 points or more.

Donte DiVincenzo backed Brunson with 25 points while Josh Hart weighed in with a monster performance that included 24 points, 13 rebounds, eight assists, three steals and a block.

Myles Turner led the Pacers scorers with 23 points while Pascal Siakam added 19.

"That's what you love about Jalen," Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said after the win. "I could go on and on about him, but the thing I love about him is he's all about the team."

Brunson's fourth quarter rally settled a pulsating contest that saw neither side gain more than a single-digit advantage across four quarters.

The Pacers opened up a nine-point lead early in the fourth quarter before the Knicks came roaring back to reel it in, edging into a four-point lead at 113-109 after Brunson's step-back jumper with 2min 42sec remaining.

DiVincenzo also came up with a huge clutch play with 40 seconds remaining, nailing a 28-foot three-pointer to put New York 118-115 ahead.

Indiana got back to within one at 118-117 but a harsh offensive foul called against Turner on DiVincenzo with 13 seconds remaining proved decisive, ceding possession back to New York and allowing the hosts to close out the win. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama was voted NBA Rookie of the Year in a unanimous decision on Monday.

The French star received all 99 first-place votes from a media panel voting on the award, joining Ralph Sampson, David Robinson, Blake Griffin, Damian Lillard and Karl-Anthony Towns as unanimous winners of the award. Oklahoma City Thunder center Chet Holmgren was a strong runner-up by receiving 98 of a possible 99 second-place votes.

Wembanyama lived up to the hype surrounding him as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 draft. He averaged 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 3.6 blocked shots and 1.2 steals in 71 games. His 254 total blocks led the league.

Wembanyama led all NBA rookies in points, rebounds and blocks along with double-doubles [43] and triple-doubles [two]. He became the youngest player in league history to post a 5x5 when he had 27 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, five blocks and five steals against the Los Angeles Lakers on Feb. 23.

Wembanyama became the first player in NBA history to tally 1,500 points, 700 rebounds, 250 assists, 250 blocked shots and 100 3-pointers in a season.

He is the first player from France to win the award and third member of the Spurs, joining franchise legends David Robinson and Tim Duncan.

Charlotte's Brandon Miller [86 total points, including one second-place vote], Miami's Jaime Jaquez Jr. [10 points], Golden State's Brandin Podziemski [four points] and Dallas' Dereck Lively II [one point] also received votes. (Reuters)]]>

    Crystal Palace thrash Man Utd 4-0

    <![CDATA[Michael Olise scored a brace of goals as Crystal Palace completed a league double over Manchester United for the first time in their history with a thumping 4-0 victory at Selhurst Park on Monday that will add to the pressure on Erik ten Hag.

A makeshift United defence that included Casemiro at centre-back was easily picked apart by Palace on several occasions as Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell were also on the scoresheet in the impressive win.

United remain in eighth place with 54 points from 35 games, two points behind Newcastle United in sixth, with their hopes of European football next season fading fast. Palace are still in 14th with 43 points from 36 matches.

United had several injury absentees and were without Bruno Fernandes, the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career he has missed a match with injury, but the ease with which they were beaten will be a huge concern for everyone at the club.

"A big disappointment. We just had an off-day and we weren't in it," midfielder Christian Eriksen said. "It is what it is. We can't really change the injury things. We have to do what we can on the pitch to change it.

"Today it didn't matter who we played. Everyone could have done better. We tried to do what we could but we were not good enough. We'll take the blame as players."

It is the first time in the Premier League era United have lost 13 games in a season and the scoreline might have been worse.

The home side took the lead inside 12 minutes as Olise collected a throw and evaded a limp challenge from Casemiro. With no United player attempting to close him down, he was able to unleash a low shot from just inside the box.

It was 2-0 five minutes before the break as Mateta breezed past United defender Jonny Evans and thrashed the ball into the net for a ninth goal in 11 games since the arrival of Glasner in February.

The striker had scored 11 goals in his previous 80 games for Palace before that.

United’s makeshift defence was struggling to contain the movement of their hosts and when Diogo Dalot failed to deal with a ball to the back post, Mitchell had a tap-in.

Olise’s second goal added more salt to the wound and it could have been worse for the visitors as Odsonne Edouard saw his shot come back off the woodwork late on. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[West Ham manager David Moyes will leave "by mutual consent" when his contract expires at the end of the season, the Premier League club said on Monday.

The announcement of Moyes's impending exit came just a day after the Hammers suffered an embarrassing 5-0 loss to London rivals Chelsea.

"West Ham United can confirm David Moyes will leave the club by mutual consent at the end of the 2023/24 season, when his contract expires," said a club statement.

Monday's announcement came amid media speculation that former Real Madrid, Wolves and Spain manager Julen Loptegui had agreed a deal to replace Moyes, in his second spell as West Ham manager, after the end of the current campaign.

Moyes said: "I have enjoyed four-and-a-half brilliant years at West Ham, and the club is in a stronger position than when I returned back in 2019.

"When I joined West Ham for a second time, the club was one place above the relegation zone, and it has been a terrific journey to have achieved three consecutive seasons in Europe."

The 61-year-old Scot, a former manager of Everton, added: "After leading the club (West Ham) to safety, we guided the team to finishes of sixth and seventh in the Premier League, and I was delighted when we won the Europa Conference League title last June – the club's first major trophy in 43 years.

"I would like to thank all the players for their support, and all the success they have achieved, over the last four-and-a-half years."

West Ham joint chairman David Sullivan told the club's website: "On behalf of everyone at West Ham United, I would like to offer our sincere thanks and gratitude to David for the contribution he has made to the football club during his time as manager.

"David has been responsible for a period of great progress and success in our history, and we are extremely grateful for all of his hard work, commitment and dedication to the role." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Donovan Mitchell and the Cleveland Cavaliers silenced the young guns of Orlando, beating the Magic 106-94 in game seven of their NBA playoffs first-round series Sunday to book a meeting with Eastern Conference top seeds Boston.

It was another magisterial performance from Mitchell, who scored 39 points two days after pouring in 50 in the Cavs' game six defeat.

This time he had plenty of scoring support from teammates as the Cavs erased an 18-point second-quarter deficit to clinch a series in which the home team won every game.

Caris LeVert scored 15 points off the bench and Max Strus scored 11 of his 13 points in the third quarter, when the Cavs out-scored the Magic 33-15 to take charge.

Evan Mobley scored 11 points with 16 rebounds and five blocked shots to help Cleveland withstand a 38-point performance from Paolo Banchero.

The Cavs, with starting center Jarrett Allen sidelined a third straight game with bruised ribs, moved on to the second round a year after a stinging first-round loss to the New York Knicks.

The Magic pushed their lead to as many as 18 points in the second quarter before the Cavs clawed back to cut the lead to single digits.

Banchero's layup in the closing seconds of the first half saw Orlando take a 10-point lead into the break, but momentum was on Cleveland's side and they overwhelmed the Magic in the third.

Mitchell, relentless in the paint, tied it at 64-64 with a floater and LeVert drained a pair of free throws to give the Cavs their first lead since the first quarter.

The Cavs pushed their advantage to 14 points in the final frame, fans chanting "We want the Celtics" as the final minutes ticked off. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[McLaren's Lando Norris won the first Formula One race of his career with a shock victory over world champion Max Verstappen in the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday.

Breathing life into an F1 season that risked becoming a one-man story again, Norris, in his 110th race for McLaren, beat Verstappen by over seven seconds with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finishing third.

Verstappen, who began on pole, had won four of the opening five races of the season and leads the world championship standings.

It looked like business as usual with the Dutchman, who had won the previous two Miami races, leading until lap 24 when he pitted and Norris's McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took over the lead.

Australian Piastri himself went into the pits four laps later, allowing Norris to grab the lead and the British driver never looked back.

Crucially, Norris was able to pit during a safety car on lap 30, earning him a valuable time advantage which he never relinquished.

The safety car came after Kevin Magnussen clipped Logan Sargeant, sending the American Williams driver into the wall, bringing a yellow flag.

Norris, who had 15 podiums before his first win, took full advantage of the safety car and with Verstappen struggling to catch up, he secured his maiden victory.

Norris was hoisted in the air by the McLaren mechanics as his long wait for a victory in the sport came to an end.

"About time huh?" said Norris, "I knew on Friday that we had the pace...today we managed to put it together. We had the perfect strategy, it all paid off," he added. (AFP)]]>
