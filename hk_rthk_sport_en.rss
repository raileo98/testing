    <![CDATA[Kai Havertz and Ben White scored twice as Arsenal thrashed Chelsea 5-0 on Tuesday to surge ahead in the Premier League title race and up the pressure on Liverpool and Manchester City.

The destiny of the title remains in City's hands as the defending champions have two games in hand.

Liverpool have also played one fewer game than Arsenal and are in action at Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday.

However, Mikel Arteta's men's goal difference advantage now looks unassailable should it become decisive in the title race.

The hosts flew out of the blocks and were in front inside five minutes.

Leandro Trossard smashed in his 15th goal of the season at Djordje Petrovic's near post.

Petrovic redeemed himself for fault at the opening goal with two brilliant saves to turn away Havertz's low effort and a deflected shot by Trossard to keep his side in the game before half-time.

However, the floodgates opened once White curled in Arsenal's second after Chelsea failed to clear a corner on 52 minutes.

Martin Odegaard's stunning through ball was then met with the finish it deserved as Havertz smashed high past Petrovic.

His next finish was more subtle as the German international fired in off the post from Bukayo Saka's pass for his seventh goal in his last 14 club games.

A night for forget for Chelsea was summed up by a sitter from Nicolas Jackson when he hit the side-netting with just David Raya to beat.

And fortune was also not on Mauricio Pochettino's side when White's attempted cross flew into the top corner from another sensational Odegaard pass. (AFP)]]>

    Feyenoord boss Slot leading race for Liverpool job

    <![CDATA[Feyenoord coach Arne Slot has emerged as the leading contender to succeed Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool manager, according to British media reports on Monday.

Slot, 45, led Feyenoord to their first league title in six years last season and won the Dutch Cup on Sunday.

He had been a front runner to take over at Tottenham a year ago before ruling himself out of contention.

Sky Sports, the BBC and The Times all reported that Slot is now leading the race for the unenviable task of following Klopp at Anfield.

However, the Reds could face competition from Bayern Munich and Barcelona, who are also looking for new coaches next season.

Bayer Leverkusen boss and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso had been the favourite when Klopp announced his decision in January to stand down at the end of the season after nearly nine years in the role.

However, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title.

Sporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim was also linked with the Liverpool vacancy but reportedly held talks with West Ham on Monday about replacing David Moyes next season.

Slot moved to Feyenoord in 2021 after impressing in his first managerial role at AZ Alkmaar.

He led the Dutch giants to the inaugural Europa Conference League final at the end of his first season, in which they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma.

Slot then delivered just a second league title in 24 years to De Kuip last season, but his side trail PSV Eindhoven by nine points with only four games remaining in this year's Eredivisie title race.

The Times said his track record of improving players and a high-octane playing style, not dissimilar to Klopp's, is what is attracting the Liverpool hierarchy.

Klopp has just five games left of a reign that has transformed Liverpool's fortunes after decades in the doldrums and could yet go out on the high by winning the Premier League.

Liverpool sit behind Arsenal only on goal difference at the top of the table, but Manchester City have the destiny of the title in their own hands as they are just one point behind the top two with a game in hand. (AFP)]]>

    Knicks rally late to stun Sixers, take 2-0 series lead

    <![CDATA[The New York Knicks scored eight points in the final 27.4 seconds to stun the Philadelphia 76ers 104-101 on Monday and take a 2-0 lead in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series.

Jalen Brunson's three-pointer pulled the Knicks within two points and after Josh Hart came up with a steal, Donte DiVincenzo capped a chaotic possession with a three-pointer – after missing his first attempt – to put New York up 102-101.

OG Anunoby sealed it at an ecstatic Madison Square Garden with a pair of free throws as the Knicks joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in taking a 2-0 lead in their first-round series.

The Cavs led wire-to-wire in a 96-86 victory over the Orlando Magic.

It was a crushing defeat for the 76ers, who didn't trail until late in the third quarter, when a Brunson layup gave the Knicks a 68-67 lead.

Philadelphia's NBA Most Valuable Player Joel Embiid was clearly hindered late by pain in his surgically repaired left knee, but the Sixers appeared to have regained control when Tyrese Maxey, fed by Embiid, made a three-pointer with 1:09 to play that put the Sixers up 100-96.

Kyle Lowry added a free throw to give the Sixers a five-point lead with less than a minute to play, but the Knicks responded.

Brunson finished with 24 points despite connecting on just eight of 29 shots from the field. He added eight rebounds and six assists and Hart added 21 points and 15 rebounds for New York.

Maxey, who skipped the Sixers' morning shoot-around because of illness, finished with 35 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists. Embiid added 34 points and 10 rebounds but missed a three-pointer at the final buzzer.

In Cleveland, Donovan Mitchell scored 23 points and Jarrett Allen added 16 points and 20 rebounds for the Cavaliers in another dominant win over the Magic.

The Cavs, eager to expunge the memory of their first-round loss to the Knicks last season, have posted two straight wire-to-wire victories.

Paolo Banchero led Orlando's scoring with 21 points and Franz Wagner added 18. The youthful Magic will be hoping to turn things around when the series shifts to Orlando. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Inter Milan won Serie A on Monday after beating AC Milan 2-1 and creating an unassailable lead at the top of the league with their sixth straight derby victory.

Goals from Francesco Acerbi and Marcus Thuram gave Inter a 17-point advantage over closest challengers Milan and secured their 20th league crown with five matches of the season remaining.

Simone Inzaghi won the first league title of his managerial career on a cold, soaking wet evening at the San Siro where a clutch of Inter's "away" fans in the 75,000 crowd roared in delight at the final whistle.

Milan made a fight of it in the final moments after Fikayo Tomori pulled one back with 10 minutes remaining but Inter held out to kick off a title party.

Inter have become the second team to win 20 Italian league titles and will have a second star stitched onto their jersey, after Juventus who are way out in the lead with 36 league crowns.

The future looks bright as Inzaghi, captain Lautaro Martinez and Italy midfielder Nicolo Barella are all set to renew their contracts while smart work in the transfer market and increased revenue has helped mitigate significant financial harm wrought by the Covid-29 pandemic.

Piotr Zielinski and Medhi Taremi will arrive from Napoli and Porto as free agents in the close season while big stars like Marcus Thuram should stay.

Off the pitch Inter's president Steven Zhang is trying to make sure that investment fund Oaktree don't take control of the club with non-repayment of an emergency loan – granted in 2021 – next month.

Zhang is looking at taking out another loan with fellow US fund Pimco so that Inter can pay Oaktree loan and ensure that the club don't wind up owned by Oaktree as Milan did with Elliott in 2018. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Jordi Fernandez, who guided Canada to a bronze medal in last year's World Cup, was named as the new head coach of the NBA's Brooklyn Nets on Monday.

The 41-year-old Spaniard, who had served as associate head coach of the Sacramento Kings for the past two seasons, will replace interim coach Kevin Ollie, who took over after Jacque Vaughn was fired in February.

"We're thrilled to announce Jordi Fernandez as Brooklyn's new head coach," Nets general manager Sean Marks said. "As we progressed through an extensive search over the past six weeks, it became increasingly clear that Jordi is the best coach to lead our team forward.

"Jordi brings a diverse set of experiences and basketball knowledge gained over the course of a coaching career that has taken him around the world. Each step of the way, Jordi has consistently demonstrated the ability to implement strong processes and creative systems designed to optimize each team's specific roster."

Fernandez helped the Kings reach the playoffs for the first time since 2006 last year, although Sacramento was eliminated by Golden State in the first round.

The Kings were eliminated by New Orleans in the eighth-seed play-in game this year.

"I'm truly grateful to lead the Nets," Fernandez said, calling it an "exciting and humbling opportunity" and added, "We will be fully committed to building something special for Nets fans and the borough to be proud of for years to come."

The Nets went 32-50 this season and missed the playoffs. Brooklyn has lost eight of 10 playoff series since moving from New Jersey in 2012, never advancing past the second round.

"We look forward to working with Jordi to build a sustainable winning culture in Brooklyn," Nets team owner Joe Tsai said.

Fernandez took over the Canadian national team last June and guided the squad to a 6-2 World Cup run, including a victory over the United States for third place.

He will still coach the Canadians at this year's Paris Olympics even with the Nets hiring, Canada Basketball said.

Fernandez spent six seasons as an assistant coach with the Denver Nuggets, served as an assistant coach for Nigeria at the Tokyo Olympics and for Spain at the 2017 EuroBasket. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[French teen Zaccharie Risacher submitted paperwork to the NBA to become eligible for the 2024 NBA Draft, where he is considered a potential number one selection, ESPN reported on Monday.

If he is top pick, Risacher would follow in the footsteps of another French teen, Victor Wembanyama, who has had a stellar debut season at the San Antonio Spurs.

The 6-foot-10 [2.08m] small forward, who turned 19 two weeks ago, told ESPN he made the move to achieve a dream as he continues a strong season for JL Bourg of Pro A, the top French league.

"It has always been my dream to get to the best league in the world," Risacher said. "I've been putting in the work for this since I was a kid. JL Bourg has given me an incredible opportunity to showcase what I can do."

Risacher is averaging 10.4 points and 3.4 rebounds while shooting 39% from 3-point range and he plays tough defensively, often opposing a rival's top scoring threat.

Risacher, whose father Stephane was a star in European leagues and helped France take a silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, sparked JL Bourg to the EuroCup Final that they lost earlier this month to Paris.

This year's NBA Draft is June 26-27 in New York. The top selection order will be decided after the NBA Draft Lottery on May 12 in Chicago, with the 14 clubs who missed the playoffs having a chance to land the top pick.

Wembanyama was the top pick in last year's NBA Draft and posted impressive stats of 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 3.6 blocked shots and 1.2 steals a game in his first season.

With the French playoffs upcoming, Risacher will have many more games and much more travel than rivals of the same age in his NBA Draft class.

"There are a lot of things I can bring an NBA team," he said. "My number one strength is my shooting. Then my defensive ability after that. And lastly, my ability to do what's asked of me, using my versatility -- I can rebound, handle the ball if needed, finish above the rim, pass the ball." (AFP)]]>

    Forest call for release of VAR audio as row grows

    <![CDATA[Nottingham Forest have asked for the VAR audio to be released from their three denied penalty appeals in a 2-0 defeat at Everton that sparked the club to call into question the integrity of Premier League officiating.

Forest issued an extraordinary post on social media soon after the final whistle at Goodison Park on Sunday saying they had "warned" referees body the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) that VAR official Stuart Attwell is a fan of relegation rivals Luton.

Forest are just one point and one place above Luton, who are in the drop zone.

"Nottingham Forest has today submitted a formal request to the PGMOL to release into the public domain the audio recordings between officials during yesterday's match against Everton at Goodison Park," Forest said in a statement on Monday.

"The club has requested this be shared for three key match incidents - Ashley Young's challenge on Giovanni Reyna (24th minute), Ashley Young's handball (44th minute) and Ashley Young's challenge on Callum Hudson-Odoi (56th minute).

"We firmly advocate for the broader football community and supporters to have access to the audio and transcript for full transparency, ensuring the integrity of our sport."

PGMOL have been pressured into releasing audio recordings of controversial incidents earlier in the season.

Referees' chiefs were forced to admit an error after Liverpool had a goal at Tottenham wrongly ruled out for offside as the VAR officials thought the goal had been awarded.

Audio of other selected incidents has also been broadcast on the "Match Officials Mic'd Up" programme during the season, but the laws of the game prevent such audio being broadcast live.

Meanwhile, the Football Association has asked Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo, defender Neco Williams and referee analyst Mark Clattenburg to explain comments they made post-match.

Forest enlisted the services of former referee Clattenburg in February as a consultant analyst to fight in their corner after believing they had been on the wrong end of a series of contentious decisions.

Writing in his Daily Mail column, Clattenburg said: "One of these errors would have been bad enough.

"Three was a joke, and that is why Nottingham Forest were left feeling victimised after another defeat in which zero big decisions went their way."

However, Forest's public blast at the officials has been hit with a backlash.

Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher accused the two-time European champions of sounding like a "fan in a pub."

"Stuart Attwell and Anthony Taylor (the referee) have had an horrific day today, awful, and they should be rightly criticised for that and that could have real implications for Nottingham Forest," said Carragher, now a Sky Sports pundit.

"I get the frustration, but that, what I've just read there on social media, that's like a fan in a pub. That is embarrassing from Nottingham Forest."

Fellow pundit Gary Neville called on Clattenburg to resign from his role with the club.

"If he sees those words go out, which question the integrity and essentially call a VAR official a cheat because he supports a certain club, then he's supporting what's being said and he would basically lose all credibility, I think, with referees in the game."

The win for Everton lifted them five points clear of the relegation zone with five games to play, despite being deducted eight points this season for breaches of financial rules.

Forest have been docked four points for the same reason. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Greek police on Monday made 60 arrests over hooligan violence that killed a riot officer during a volleyball game in December, the country's police chief said.

"Our commitment to combating sports violence is absolute," Dimitris Mallios said in a statement on the operation.

Yiorgos Lyggeridis, 31, was fatally injured by a marine flare fired outside a sports hall during a December 2023 Olympiacos-Panathinaikos volleyball match near Piraeus. 

The riot police officer died later in hospital and stadia across the country were closed for several weeks after the death.

Mallios said a four-month police investigation had found links between hooligans and organised crime.

Over 150 people are suspected of involvement, Mallios said.

Sport in Greece has been repeatedly marred in recent years by deaths and violent incidents at sports events.

In August, a 29-year-old AEK Athens football fan died after being stabbed during clashes between Athens and Dinamo Zagreb supporters on the eve of a Champions League qualifying match. (AFP)]]>

    No systemic Chinese doping, says Australian swim coach

    <![CDATA[Australian swimming coach Denis Cotterell has rejected allegations of orchestrated doping in Chinese swimming, saying China is adamant about clean sport.

Cotterell is working with China's top swimmers in the lead-up to the Paris Olympics and previously coached 1,500 metres freestyle world record holder Sun Yang, who is now suspended for a doping offence.

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) confirmed reports over the weekend that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned drug before the Tokyo Olympics.

WADA said it had accepted China's findings that the results were due to contamination and decided against appealing the matter, triggering criticism from top swimmers and the US anti-doping authority.

Cotterell told the Sydney Morning Herald he stood by his swimmers "100%" and said any positive test results in Chinese swimming were not part of a state-run programme.

"I am happy to say I’m absolutely in support of my swimmers and dispute any suggestion of anything orchestrated," Cotterell said.

"The suggestion that it's systemic is so far from anything I have seen here the whole time.

"They are so adamant on having clean sport.

"It's sad to see what this suggests or looks like. It’s unfortunate for everyone. I feel for the athletes here because of how hard they work now to eliminate the tag that was garnered in the '90s."

Leading coaches and swimmers criticised WADA and China's anti-doping authority over the weekend and questioned why the 23 swimmers' test results were not made public.

Cotterell said he understood if rival swimmers were upset and that the process could have been better handled.

"It unfortunately allows that doubt to come out and to surface. I can’t prove anything, I just know the truth," he said.

However, he was also insistent that failed drug tests from contaminated food was a consistent risk in China.

"(Swimmers) are not allowed to eat outside anywhere. When they go on a plane, they can’t eat the food," he added.

Media reports said the swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine (TMZ), which is found in heart medication, months before the Tokyo Games started in July 2021. 

WADA said after reviewing a television documentary and newspaper reports that it stands by its decision to clear the 23 swimmers to compete at the Tokyo Olympics. 

The anti-doping agency issued a statement on Sunday following the release of a documentary on the cases by German broadcaster ARD.

In an earlier statement following initial newspaper reports, WADA said it agreed with Chinese authorities and ruled that the swimmers’ samples had been contaminated.

The New York Times reported that Chinese anti-doping authorities found the results of the tests were Adverse Analytical Findings but cleared the swimmers without any penalties after finding that the samples were flagged as positive as a result of contamination.

“Following WADA’s review of the documentary, the agency still stands firmly by the results of its scientific investigation and legal decision concerning the case,” WADA said in the statement on Sunday. 

“We are equally confident that WADA’s independent Intelligence and Investigations Department followed up on all allegations received, which were not corroborated by any evidence; and thus, did not meet WADA threshold to open an investigation.”

WADA said based on available scientific evidence and intelligence, “which was gathered, assessed and tested by experts in the pharmacology of trimetazidine (TMZ); and, by anti-doping experts,” it had no basis under the global anti-doping code to challenge the Chinese agency's findings of environmental contamination. 

The Foreign Ministry on Monday called reports about the swimmers testing positive "fake news".

"I believe you will also have noted that the World Anti-Doping Agency has put out a very clear response," spokesman Weng Wenbin told a regular briefing.

"After an in-depth and detailed investigation of this incident by the China anti-doping centre in 2021, it was determined that the relevant athletes had ingested contaminated drugs without their knowledge.

"The Chinese swimmers involved were neither at fault nor guilty of negligence, and their behaviour did not constitute a doping violation.

"After an investigation, WADA affirmed the findings of the China anti-doping centre."

Wang added that Beijing has a zero-tolerance position towards doping.

"We strictly adhere to the (relevant) global provisions and resolutely protect the physical and mental health of athletes.

"We uphold fair competition in sports events and have made active contributions to the global fight against doping," he said. (Agencies)

    Ohtani breaks MLB mark for homers by Japan-born player

    <![CDATA[Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani belted his 176th career home run to move past Hideki Matsui for most homers by a Japanese player in Major League Baseball on Sunday

Ohtani crushed an 0-1 pitch from Mets right-handed hurler Adrian Houser 423 feet into Dodger Stadium's right field bleachers to break a tie with Matsui atop the list.

Matsui, who was the 2009 World Series Most Valuable Player with the New York Yankees, needed 10 seasons in the MLB to put up 175 home runs. Ohtani has passed him in his seventh campaign.

Ohtani has five home runs this season. He had tied Matsui with a homer on April 13 and then gone seven games without a homer.

In that span Ohtani was 11-for-29 at the plate, with three doubles and six walks.

"Honestly I was just relieved I was able to just get it over with, I was just happy I was able to do that," Ohtani said.

After Sunday's two-run blast, Ohtani reached base twice more in the Dodgers' 10-0 victory over the Mets.

Ohtani, the 29-year-old ace regarded as the most talented all-around player since Babe Ruth, is in the first year of his record-shattering 10-year, US$700 million deal with the Dodgers.

His first campaign in Los Angeles began under a cloud after revelations that his long-time interpreter had stolen millions of dollars from him to pay off gambling debts to an illegal bookmaker.

Ippei Mizuhara is currently free on bond and under court orders to undergo treatment for gambling addition after being accused of stealing US$16 million from Ohtani, who prosecutors say is a victim in the case.

While Ohtani is not pitching this year as he recovers from right elbow surgery, Ohtani is off to a strong start at the plate. He leads MLB with 35 hits and 11 doubles and a .368 batting average. (AFP)

    Snooker star Vafaei says Crucible can learn from China

    <![CDATA[Iran's Hossein Vafaei said Sunday that the Crucible Theatre venue for the world snooker championships "smells really bad" and the tournament can learn from China where players are "treated like stars".

Vafaei lost his first-round clash 10-5 to former champion Judd Trump and lashed out at the conditions at the arena in Sheffield which has hosted the event since 1977.

"Everything's so – if you ask me if I want to come back here, I would tell you no way," said Vafaei.

"Forget the history, you want to go somewhere really nice as a player. You walk round the Crucible and it smells really bad. You go to other countries, and everything is shiny. But here it's completely different.

"The practice room – do you see anything special? I feel like I'm practising in a garage."

World number one Ronnie O'Sullivan has already suggested the world championship should be moved to Saudi Arabia or China when the existing deal expires in 2027.

"Look at the China venues, how fantastic they treat the players, a red carpet and an opening ceremony," said Vafaei.

"The players are treated like stars. But here no one looks after the players, before and after the match no one cares who you are.

"If they don't want to lose the Crucible invest some money, make it shinier, make it nicer, make it more luxury for the people. If they make it cleaner and nicer, people will enjoy it."

The World Snooker Tour responded by saying "the Crucible is a historic venue and there are limitations given the size of the backstage areas".

They added in a statement: "We work with the Crucible to make it as welcoming as possible for players." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Damian Lillard scored all 35 of his points in the first half as the Milwaukee Bucks struck early in a 109-94 victory over Indiana in their NBA playoffs opener despite the absence of Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Lillard's explosive first half included a 19-point first quarter, and his 35 points were a record for any Bucks player in any half of a playoff game.

He made 11 of 22 shots, including six three-pointers to stake the Bucks to a 69-42 halftime lead.

He didn't make a basket in the second half, but his teammates picked up the slack and the prolific Pacers offense was held under 100 points for just the second time this season.

Tyrese Haliburton, chosen ahead of Lillard for the US Paris Olympic squad, finished with just nine points for the Pacers, who were led by Pascal Siakam's 36 points and 13 rebounds.

The Bucks followed the blueprint laid out earlier Sunday by the Los Angeles Clippers and Boston Celtics, who both got off to strong starts in convincing game-one victories.

Eastern Conference top seeds Boston raced to a 14-0 lead to set the tone for a 114-94 victory over the Miami Heat in the first game of their best-of-seven series.

Jayson Tatum's first playoff triple-double of 23 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists propelled the Celtics.

While Bam Adebayo led Miami with 24 points and six rebounds, with Jimmy Butler absent nursing a knee ligament injury.

The Clippers, with Kawhi Leonard sidelined with knee inflammation, led wire-to-wire in a 109-97 victory over Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks, who put up just eight points in a shocking second quarter performance.

James Harden scored 28 points and handed out eight assists for the Clippers, drilling six of their 18 three-pointers.

Paul George added 22 points and Ivica Zubac scored 20 points with 15 rebounds for Los Angeles, who seized control early as Dallas and NBA regular-season scoring leader Doncic struggled.

Doncic would finish with 33 points and 13 rebounds and Kyrie Irving scored 31, but the Mavs were in too deep of a hole to escape. (AFP)

    Liverpool bounce back, Forest fume after Everton loss

    <![CDATA[Liverpool got back on track after their week from hell as a 3-1 win at Fulham kept their Premier League title bid alive, while Nottingham Forest launched an astonishing rant at the officiating in their 2-0 defeat against Everton on Sunday.

Jurgen Klopp's side crashed out of the Europa League quarter-finals against Atalanta on Thursday after suffering a damaging Premier League defeat at home to Crystal Palace last weekend.

The Reds' hopes of giving Klopp a glorious farewell were dwindling but they climbed back into the title race with a much-needed first win in three league games.

Liverpool are now in second place, behind leaders Arsenal on goal difference and one point ahead of third placed Manchester City, who have a game in hand on their two title rivals.

Next for Liverpool is the Merseyside derby at Everton on Wednesday, while Arsenal host Chelsea on Tuesday and City travel to Brighton on Thursday.

Klopp responded to signs of fatigue from his team in recent weeks by dropping Mohamed Salah to the bench among five changes.

And Liverpool took the hint with a more cohesive display by the banks of the River Thames in west London.

Trent Alexander-Arnold put Liverpool ahead in the 32nd minute with a superb free-kick that flashed into the top corner.

Fulham defender Timothy Castagne levelled from close-range after Liverpool failed to clear in first half stoppage-time.

Ryan Gravenberch restored Liverpool's advantage in the 53rd minute with a swerving blast from the edge of the area for his first Premier League goal.

Diogo Jota wrapped up the points in the 72nd minute, drilling a clinical low finish into the far corner.

Everton took a giant stride towards extending their 70-year stay in the English top-flight in a highly controversial victory over Forest.

Idrissa Gueye and Dwight McNeil scored the goals that took the Toffees five points clear of the relegation zone.

Forest remain just one point above the bottom three and were left dismayed at being denied three strong penalty appeals.

The club's official account on social media platform X called into question the Premier League's integrity by claiming the VAR official is a fan of relegation rivals Luton.

"We warned the PGMOL (referees' governing body) that the VAR is a Luton fan before the game but they didn't change him," Forest said in a statement.

"Our patience has been tested multiple times. NFFC will now consider its options."

Aston Villa tightened their grip on Champions League football next season with a 3-1 win over Bournemouth.

Villa shrugged off the exertions of having to go to extra-time and penalties in midweek to book their place in the Europa Conference League semi-finals against Lille.

Unai Emery's men even had to come from behind after Dominic Solanke opened the scoring from the penalty spot.

Morgan Rogers' fine finish just before half-time proved to be the turning point.

Moussa Diaby slotted in from Ollie Watkins' pass to put Villa in front.

Watkins was the provider once more for Leon Bailey to tap in to seal the points 12 minutes from time.

Victory takes Villa six points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham.

Spurs have two games in hand but still have to play all three title challengers Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool in their final six matches.

David Moyes' future as West Ham manager looks more uncertain after they were thrashed 5-2 at Crystal Palace.

Fresh from their shock 1-0 win at Liverpool last weekend, the Eagles scored four times inside the first 31 minutes.

Michael Olise headed in the opener before Eberechi Eze's spectacular acrobatic effort found the roof of the net.

Emerson Palmieri's own goal made it 3-0 before Jean-Philippe Mateta struck twice for Palace either side of half-time.

Michail Antonio's strike and a Tyrick Mitchell own goal was scant consolation for West Ham as a miserable day rounded off a poor week after they were dumped out of the Europa League by Bayer Leverkusen. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Manchester United overcame an astonishing collapse to beat Coventry on penalties in an FA Cup classic on Sunday, setting up a second straight FA Cup final against Manchester City.

Erik ten Hag's men won the shootout at Wembley 4-2, with Rasmus Hojlund scoring the decisive spot kick after the teams were level at 3-3 after extra-time.

The game perfectly encapsulated a chaotic season for Ten Hag's men, who are well off the pace in the Premier League and had a Champions League campaign to forget.

There was no hint of what was to come when United coasted into a 3-0 lead against their second-tier opponents in the London sunshine, with goals from Scott McTominay, Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes.

But they have made a habit of tossing away leads in recent weeks and the match against Coventry proved no different.

Second-half strikes from Ellis Simms and Callum O'Hare gave the 1987 FA Cup winners hope and Haji Wright levelled from the penalty spot in the 95th minute, capping a scarcely credible comeback.

Coventry fans taunted Ten Hag with chants of "you're getting sacked in the morning" as belief infused the massed ranks of supporters clad in blue.

Coventry manager Mark Robins famously played a key part in United's FA Cup final win in 1990, a victory that launched two decades of success under Alex Ferguson.

But his team's push to reach the Championship play-offs has faded in recent weeks and they travelled to Wembley as underdogs despite United's stuttering season.

United, 12-time winners of the competition, settled early and took the lead in the 23rd minute after a fine move down the right.

Alejandro Garnacho fed the overlapping Diogo Dalot, whose cross went under the hands of the diving Bradley Collins and was tapped in by McTominay from close range.

Marcus Rashford forced a fine save from Collins late in the first half but United doubled their lead from the resulting corner, with Maguire heading home from Fernandes's cross.

Coventry, who scored twice in stoppage time to beat Premier League Wolves in the quarter-finals, struggled to make inroads against an organised United team.

They looked brighter in the early stages of the second half.

But the wind was taken out of their sails when Fernandes's shot found its way past Collins in the 58th minute, courtesy of a deflection off defender Bobby Thomas.

O'Hare headed over from an angle as Coventry continued to probe but they pulled a goal back when top-scorer Ellis Simms connected with a cross from substitute Fabio Tavares in the 71st minute after United's defence switched off.

They made it 3-2 in the 79th minute when O'Hare's shot from just outside the box looped off Aaron Wan-Bissaka's back and over Onana.

Coventry's fans were now in full voice as their team mounted waves of attacks.

Substitute Victor Torp hit a stinging shot from the edge of the area with five minutes of normal time to go, forcing Onana into a sharp save.

But Coventry were still not finished.

Wan-Bissaka was adjudged to have handled in the penalty area and Wright scored from the spot to take the match into extra time.

Coventry looked the more likely winners in 10 long minutes of stoppage time but could not find a winner.

United captain Fernandes rattled the crossbar in the fourth minute of extra time when set up by substitute Amad Diallo.

Simms then smashed a shot off the underside of the crossbar as time ran out.

Coventry thought they had won it in the dying moments when Torp poked the ball past Andre Onana but a VAR check ruled that Wright was marginally offside.

The Championship side drew first blood in the shootout when Casemiro's weak penalty was saved by Collins.

But O'Hare and captain Ben Sheaf failed to convert, leaving Hojlund with the job of sending United through and he made no mistake.

Manchester City beat Chelsea 1-0 in the other semi-final on Saturday. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Max Verstappen rounded off a dominant weekend with victory in the first Chinese Grand Prix for five years on Sunday to extend his world championship lead a day after romping to sprint victory.

The three-time world champion controlled the race on its return to the Shanghai International Circuit for the first time since 2019 to finish 13.7 seconds ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris with Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez third.

He was only denied a 100 percent points-scoring weekend when Fernando Alonso picked up the bonus for the fastest lap around the 5.451 kilometre track on the outskirts of Shanghai after a late switch to fresh tyres.

It was another all-conquering display from Verstappen, who won his fourth grand prix this season to add to his sprint victory.

Only a rare brake failure in Melbourne denied Verstappen the chance of a clean sweep in all five races in 2024, as he marches inexorably towards a fourth consecutive world title.

"It felt amazing, all weekend we were incredibly quick," said Verstappen, who recorded his first victory in China.

"It felt amazing, it was so enjoyable to drive on every single compound. The car was on rails, I could do whatever I wanted to do with it."

The Ferrari pair of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz were fourth and fifth, George Russell was sixth for Mercedes with Alonso seventh after a late charge through the field.

McLaren's Oscar Piastri was eighth, chased home by Lewis Hamilton who clawed his way up to ninth from 18th on the grid.

The points scorers were rounded out by the Haas of Nico Hulkenberg in 10th.

China's first Formula One driver Zhou Guanyu has been an enormous draw over the weekend as he made his home grand prix debut.

He was allowed to park his car on the grid in front of the grandstands after the race and exited the cockpit in floods of tears to an ovation from the capacity crowd. (AFP)]]>

    Jepchirchir, Munyao seal London Marathon Kenyan double

    <![CDATA[Olympic champion Peres Jepchirchir won the London marathon in a women's-only world record on Sunday as Alexander Mutiso Munyao's victory in the men's race made it a Kenyan double.

The race was preceded by 30 seconds of applause for Kelvin Kiptum, 2023 winner of the men's race, who was killed in a car accident in February.

A poignant day ended with two more Kenyan victories with Jepchirchir in particular putting down a marker ahead of her defence of her title at the Paris Olympics.

The field for the women's race was considered one of the best ever assembled with three of the four fastest women in history competing.

The 30-year-old Kenyan came home in front of world record holder Tigst Assefa and Joyciline Jepkosgei to break the record mark without male pacemakers.

Jepchirchir's time of 2 hours 16 minutes 16 seconds smashed the women's-only course record of 2:17:01 set by compatriot Mary Keitany in 2017.

Retired British star Paula Radcliffe ran a time of 2:15:25 in a mixed-sex marathon in London in 2003, using male pacemakers.

"I was not expecting to run a world record," said Jepchirchir. "I knew it might be beat but I did not expect it to be me.

"I am so happy to qualify for the Olympics and I feel grateful. I'm happy to be at Paris and my pray(er) is to be there and run well to defend my title. I know it won't be easy but I'll try my best."

Munyao got the better of Ethiopian legend Kenenisa Bekele to take the men's race in 2:04:01.

A three-time Olympic gold medallist on the track, Bekele was on course for his first win on the streets of London aged 41 but Munyao proved too strong in the closing kilometres to pull clear up London's famous landmark The Mall towards the finish line.

"At 40 kilometres I got some pressure from Bekele but I had a lot of confidence because I trained for this race," said Munyao.

"After 40 kilometres I thought I had enough energy to win. That's why I kicked and I knew I would win."

The 27-year-old also paid tribute to Kiptum, whose sudden death sent shockwaves through the sport.

"I think about him and let him rest in peace. He came here in London and he won."

Behind the front two it was a great day for the British duo of Emile Cairess and Mahamed Mahamed as they finished third and fourth respectively to close in on a place at the Paris Olympics.

A record number of people ran the 26.2-mile (42 kilometre) route through the British capital with over 50,000 participants taking part. (AFP)]]>

Cheerleading, a wushu performance and skateboarding were just some of the spectacles kicking off the biennial sports competition.

Athletes from the territory's 18 districts entered the venue before table tennis players Minnie Soo and Ding Ning, wushu athlete Samuel Hui and badminton player Wang Yilyu took part in a torch relay, lighting the cauldron together to signify the beginning of the games.

    <![CDATA[The defending champion Denver Nuggets, powered by 32 points from Nikola Jokic, shook off a slow start to beat LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers 114-103 in game one of their NBA playoffs first-round series on Sunday.

The Nuggets, who swept the Lakers in four games in the Western Conference finals on the way to their first title last season, continued their dominance of star-studded Los Angeles, who had dropped all three regular-season meetings.

The game was the finale of the first day of the playoffs, which saw the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the Phoenix Suns 120-95, the New York Knicks beat the Philadelphia 76ers 111-104 and the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Orlando Magic 97-83.

In Denver, Jokic added 12 rebounds and seven assists, Jamal Murray added 22 points with 10 assists and Michael Porter Jr. scored 19 for the Nuggets, who used a 13-0 scoring run to take charge in the third quarter -- in which they limited the Lakers to 18 points.

James scored 32 points and grabbed 14 rebounds and Anthony Davis added 27 for the Lakers, who cut a 15-point deficit early in the fourth quarter to six only for the Nuggets to pull away again.

"Mindset needed to change," Jokic said of the Nuggets' third-quarter resurgence. "I think for the second half defense was amazing."

Lakers coach Darvin Ham said the Nuggets' 15-6 superiority in offensive rebounding was key as Denver piled up 18 second-chance points.

"You can't allow them to get multiple possessions," said Ham, who added that he still believed the best-of-seven series, which resumes Monday, will be a "hard fought" affair.

In Minneapolis, Anthony Edwards scored 23 of his 33 points in the second half as the Minnesota Timberwolves thrashed Kevin Durant and the Phoenix Suns in their Western Conference clash.

Against a team that also had their number in the regular season, Minnesota's Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert -- bolstered by a strong supporting cast - turned the tables.

"I think everybody here knows that's my favorite player of all time," Edwards said of two-time NBA champ Durant. "That was probably one of the best feelings ever in my whole life, for sure." (AFP)]]>

    Arsenal grind out Wolves win to go top of the table

    <![CDATA[Arsenal shrugged off the disappointment of their Champions League exit to move back to the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win at Wolves on Saturday.

Leandro Trossard and Martin Odegaard struck at the end of each half to take the Gunners one point clear of Manchester City, who have a game in hand.

Arsenal's season was in danger of coming completely off the rails after a three-game winless run.

Mikel Arteta's men lost in the Premier League for the first time in 2024 last weekend, 2-0 at home to Aston Villa, in between a Champions League quarter-final elimination by Bayern Munich.

However, they bounced back to keep the pressure on champions City, who beat Chelsea 1-0 to reach the FA Cup final earlier on Saturday.

Arteta made just three changes from the side that lost 1-0 in Munich on Wednesday and it took some time for the sluggish visitors to find their stride.

Wolves boss Gary O'Neil claimed his side have been struck by the worst injury crisis he has encountered in his professional career.

Yet, the undermanned hosts were nearly in front when David Raya was forced to turn Joao Gomes' powerful effort onto the crossbar.

Arsenal had only fleetingly threatened before the break despite their dominance of possession.

But they got the slice of fortune they needed to kickstart their challenge for a first title in 20 years on 44 minutes when Trossard's mishit shot clipped in off the far post.

There was little in the way of goalmouth action in the second period as fatigue took hold of Arsenal in their fourth game in 11 days.

However, shorn of the threat of the injured Matheus Cunha and Pedro Neto, Wolves lacked the attacking inspiration to further dent their title aspirations.

Odegaard made the points safe five minutes into stoppage time by catching Jose Sa out at his near post.

Third-placed Liverpool can move level on points with Arsenal when they visit Fulham on Sunday.

At the bottom of the table, Luton's hopes of survival were hammered by Brentford's 5-1 rout at Kenilworth Road.

Luton's heaviest home league defeat of the season leaves the Hatters still one point adrift of Nottingham Forest, who visit Everton on Sunday in a huge clash at the bottom of the table.

"Today was a bad day for us as a club but the teams directly above us play each other and we will not be out of it this weekend. It's important we all remember that," said Luton boss Rob Edwards.

Brentford realistically secured their top-flight status with a dominant display despite missing England striker Ivan Toney through injury.

Yoane Wissa struck twice before half-time, while Ethan Pinnock, Keane Lewis-Potter and Kevin Schade were also on target for the Bees.

Burnley are now within two points of Luton and three of survival after cruising to a 4-1 victory at rock bottom Sheffield United.

Two of the Clarets' five league wins this season have come against the Blades.

Burnley scored twice in two minutes just before half-time through Jacob Bruun Larsen and Lorenz Assignon.

Gustavo Hamer pulled a goal back for the home side early in the second period.

But United are destined to head straight back down to the Championship due to their woeful defending.

Lyle Foster and Johann Gudmundsson rounded off the scoring to leave Chris Wilder's men 10 points adrift of safety with just five games remaining.

"I won't name names, but I think there were a few players out there who wanted to get out of there pretty quickly after the fourth went in," said Wilder. "You just can't have (that)." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Bernardo Silva fired Manchester City back into the FA Cup final as the Portugal midfielder's late strike sealed the holders' 1-0 win against Chelsea at Wembley on Saturday.

Pep Guardiola's side were second best for long periods of the semi-final, but Chelsea wasted a string of chances before Silva delivered the knockout blow six minutes from full-time.

Shaken by their Champions League quarter-final loss against Real Madrid on penalties in midweek, City took a while to shake off the gloom from the end of their treble bid.

They were hampered by the absence of Norway striker Erling Haaland after he suffered a knock against Real, with Julian Alvarez unable to make an impact as his replacement.

City were bailed out by Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson's profligacy and Guardiola will hope the hard-fought success provides a timely lift as they chase a Premier League and FA Cup double.

City face Manchester United or Coventry, who meet on Sunday, in the final on May 25 and will retain the Premier League title if they win their last six games.

It will be City's 13th final in the competition and potentially a repeat of last year's 2-1 win over United in the Wembley Manchester derby.

Beaten by Liverpool in the League Cup final in February, Chelsea's wait to win their first domestic trophy since the 2018 FA Cup goes on for another season.

It was a bitter blow for Blues boss Mauricio Pochettino, who has endured a difficult first season in charge and remains without silverware in England.

The semi-final was billed as in-form Chelsea forward Cole Palmer's chance to punish his old club for selling him to the Blues in September.

Guardiola said Palmer was asking to leave City for two years before he eventually joined Chelsea, where he has scored 23 goals in all competitions this, including 11 in his last six games.

Palmer, who scored four times in Monday's 6-0 rout of Everton, was a constant threat for Chelsea, but ultimately it was his team's lack of killer instinct that proved decisive.

Palmer's pin-point pass sent Jackson racing into the City area early on, but his strike lacked the accuracy to beat Stefan Ortega in a miss that foreshadowed Chelsea's fate.

Jackson wasted a golden opportunity to give Chelsea the goal their dominance deserved.

Enzo Fernandez's pass split the City defence, but Jackson opted to go around Ortega rather than shoot and the chance was gone as Nathan Ake scurried back to clear.

Playing with more purpose and quality than City, Pochettino's team threatened again as Palmer cleverly shimmied past Rodri for a low drive from 12 yards that was well saved by Ortega.

It was the first time lethargic City had failed to muster a first half shot on target since a game against Everton in February.

Jackson, in the midst of a terrible debut season, was put clean through on goal by Conor Gallagher immediately after the interval.

But the much-maligned striker's shot was palmed away by Ortega, who clawed away a close-range header from Jackson seconds later.

City finally tested Djordje Petrovic through Phil Foden's snap-shot, but the Serbian was equal to his powerful strike.

Chelsea appealed in vain for a penalty when Jack Grealish's arm blocked Palmer's free-kick, while Moises Caicedo was fortunate to escape a second booking for a crunching tackle that forced Grealish to limp off.

Grealish's replacement Jeremy Doku drew an immediate save from Petrovic with a near-post blast.

Doku's presence lifted City and the Belgian played a part as they stole the victory in the 84th minute.

Advancing with intent towards the Chelsea area, Doku slipped a pass to Kevin de Bruyne, whose low cross was pushed out by Petrovic to Silva for a close-range finish that deflected home as Guardiola punched the air in relief. (AFP)]]>
