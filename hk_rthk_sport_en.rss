    <![CDATA[Manchester City won an unprecedented fourth straight English top flight title with a 3-1 win over West Ham United on Sunday to pip rivals Arsenal on the final day of a thrilling Premier League season as the fans turned the pitch into a sea of blue.

Two glorious early goals from league player of the season Phil Foden created a party atmosphere in the sunshine at the Etihad Stadium, before a stunning bicycle kick from Mohammed Kudus before halftime brought West Ham briefly into the game.

But Rodri sealed the victory with a low 59th minute shot from outside the area, giving Pep Guardiola's side a phenomenal sixth title in seven years. Fans danced in their seats, belting out: "Champions again!" and "Are you watching Arsenal?"

In one of the closest title races in Premier League history, Arsenal could have taken the championship had City dropped points. But the Londoners' 2-1 win in their game against Everton was in vain, leaving them two points behind.

City have the chance of winning the double as they face Manchester United in the FA Cup final next Saturday.

Foden's already brilliant season got even better when he arrowed the ball into the top corner in the second minute then capped a fine team move to sweep home the second in the 18th.

"It's so hard to put into words what we've done today," Foden said. "No team has ever done it. You see what it means to the fans and it means to us. Working all year for this moment.

"I thought today we just looked confident and just played our football and in the end it paid off."

The midfielder has scored 19 league goals this season and has won six Premier League titles at just 23, making him one of England's best hopes for this year's Euros in Germany.

At the final whistle, the home fans poured onto the pitch, some letting off blue flares in celebration, while the players hugged each other in joy. (Reuters)]]>

    Verstappen holds off Norris charge in Imola victory

    <![CDATA[Max Verstappen held off a late charge by McLaren's Lando Norris to win the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix by less than a second on Sunday.

Red Bull's triple Formula One world champion took the chequered flag just 0.725 of a second ahead of the man who beat him at the previous round in Miami and sensed he might snatch another.

The win was Verstappen's fifth in seven races this season, the 59th of his career and the third edition in a row at Imola. Last year's race at the Italian circuit was cancelled due to heavy flooding.

"I had no grip anymore. I was sliding a lot. I saw Lando closing in. The last 10 laps were flat out," said a relieved Verstappen, who had appeared set for another easy win but had to sweat ultimately for the spoils.

"It's difficult when the tyres were not working anymore and you have to go flat out. I couldn't afford to make too many mistakes. Luckily we didn't."

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was third at the Italian team's atmospheric home track, 7.916 off the pace, for his fourth podium finish of the season and a home race to come in Monaco next weekend.

The victory extended Verstappen's championship lead to 48 points, with Leclerc now his closest rival after Red Bull's Sergio Perez started 11th and finished only eighth.

Verstappen has 161 points, Leclerc 113 and Perez 107. Red Bull have 268 in the constructors' standings with Ferrari on 212 and McLaren on 154.

McLaren's Oscar Piastri finished fourth, after starting fifth due to a three-place grid penalty for impeding in qualifying.

Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was fifth and the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell sixth and seventh on another afternoon to forget for the once-dominant team. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[The chief executive of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Tony Choi, said on Sunday that qualifying for fewer events at the Paris Olympics compared with the Tokyo Games will still be considered a success for Hong Kong athletes.

Speaking on a TVB programme, Choi estimated that Hong Kong would qualify for about 30 events in all disciplines this time, about 10 fewer than in Tokyo three years ago. 

Choi said the SAR's success at the Tokyo Games was partly due to its Covid-19 measures, which minimised the pandemic's impact on elite athletes' training and gave Hong Kong the edge over other places.

Hong Kong won one gold, two silver and three bronze medals in Tokyo, its best showing at an Olympics.

"When the Hong Kong Sports Institute was preparing for the Tokyo Olympics, we didn't stop training for a single day. I believe many countries and regions couldn't do that. So back then, we had such advantages," he said.

"This time, we're getting more than 30 tickets, which is still reaching our target."

Choi also expressed hopes of breaking the pattern of Hong Kong winning medals every other Olympics, since windsurfer Lee Lai-shan captured gold in Atlanta in 1996 for the city's first medal ever.

“We got a medal in the 1996 [Olympics], then in 2000 we didn’t. And in 2004 we had one and 2008 we didn’t. 2012 we got a medal then 2016 we didn’t... Honestly speaking, the Hong Kong team’s results are relatively inconsistent. We hope everything can be more stable,” he said. 

“We hope to win at least a medal in every Olympics... We need to maintain a stable performance in the international sports scene in order to compete with other sports powerhouses.”

Choi said Hong Kong is already competitive in sports such as fencing, swimming, table tennis, badminton, karate and squash, and it'll take time to catch up in other disciplines.]]>

    Usyk takes undisputed title for first time in 25 years

    <![CDATA[Oleksandr Usyk beat Tyson Fury by split decision to win the world's first undisputed heavyweight championship on Sunday, an unprecedented feat in boxing's four-belt era.

Britain's Fury was the early aggressor but Usyk gradually took charge and the "Gypsy King" was saved by the bell in the ninth round before slumping to his first career defeat.

Ukraine's Usyk joins the likes of Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis and Mike Tyson as undisputed heavyweight champion, the first since boxing recognised four major belts in the 2000s.

With the win, the still-undefeated former undisputed cruiserweight champion can legitimately claim to be the best of this era, although a rematch expected in October could provide another twist.

"It is a big opportunity for me, for my family, for my country," said Usyk, 37, who briefly served as a soldier after Russia launched its military campaign in Ukraine in 2022.

"It's a great time, a great day," he said, adding that he was "ready for a rematch".

Fury called it a "fantastic fight with Oleksandr".

"I believe I won that fight, I believe he won a few of the rounds, but I won the majority of them," he said.

"You know his country is at war, so people are siding with the country at war but make no mistake, I won that fight in my opinion and I will be back."

Britain's Lennox Lewis was the last man to unify the heavyweight belts -- three at the time -- after beating Evander Holyfield in 1999.

Two judges scored it for Usyk by scores of 115-112 and 114-113 while the third gave it to Fury 114-113. The victory extended Usyk's professional record to 22-0. After his first loss, Fury stands at 34-1-1.

Usyk, who adds Fury's WBC belt to his IBF, WBA and WBO titles, looks set to go down as one of the greats after dominating at amateur, cruiserweight and now the top division.

A fired-up Fury came running out of his corner to start the fight and the 2.06 metre boxer was quickly into his rhythm, keeping the shorter Usyk back with his jab and playing to the crowd.

Usyk got inside with some quick combinations while Fury landed some heavy body shots. By round four, the Mancunian was taunting his ever-advancing opponent and showboating, guard down.

Usyk called two low shots in round five and got caught with a left hook as Fury continued to look comfortable, landing a telling uppercut in the following round and bobbing and weaving to stay out of range.

But the Ukrainian tagged Fury with two clean lefts in the seventh and landed a punishing hook that dazed the "Gypsy King" in the eighth.

By the next round, a relentless Usyk barrage had Fury in serious trouble and the wobbling, bleeding Mancunian took a standing count before being saved by the bell.

Fury recovered his poise and with the match in the balance heading into the final round, both fighters were finding the target.

Wladimir Klitschko was among the legends watching along with Saudi-based football stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, who like boxing are grateful beneficiaries of the oil-rich monarchy's lavish push into sports. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Shane Lowry matched the lowest round in major golf history on Saturday, shooting a nine-under par 62 in the third round of the PGA Championship at Valhalla.

The 37-year-old Irishman tied the mark achieved four prior times, most recently in Thursday's first round by Xander Schauffele.

Other 62s were made by Schauffele and fellow American Rickie Fowler in the first round at last year's US Open and the 2017 British Open by South African Branden Grace.

The bogey-free round left Lowry, the 2019 British Open winner, on 13-under par 200 for 54 holes, one stroke behind leader Schauffele, who was still on the course.

Lowry birdied eight of the first 14 holes at Valhalla to reach 12-under and briefly share the lead, sinking birdie putts of 37 feet at 13 and 32 feet at the par-3 14th.

He fired 29 on the front nine with birdies on six of the first nine holes, four of those between 13 and 19 feet.

When Lowry sank a birdie putt from just beyond six feet at the par-4 17th, there was a buzz around the course as he walked to the par-5 finishing hole, one softened and more receptive after rain earlier this week.

At 18, Lowry's tee shot found the left rough and his second shot landed in the left rough, but his third drew wild applause, setting him up for a birdie putt from just inside 12 feet.

Lowry's bid to make the first 61 in major championship history missed but he tapped in for 62 and a share of history. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Red Bull's Max Verstappen equalled Ayrton Senna's record of eight pole positions in a row with the fastest lap in qualifying for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola on Saturday.

The late Brazilian's run was set in 1988/89 with McLaren and Verstappen, also a triple Formula One world champion, started his sequence in Abu Dhabi at the end of last season and has yet to be out-qualified in 2024.

Verstappen's 39th career pole came as Formula One marks 30 years since Senna, who had 65 poles, died in a crash at the Italian circuit on May 1, 1994.

"It's a great start to the year and very special," said the Dutch driver after also matching Alain Prost's record 1993 seven successive poles at the start of a season.

"It's 30 years since he (Senna) passed away, so very pleased to get pole and in a way it's a nice memory to him. He was an incredible F1 driver, especially in qualifying," added Verstappen.

McLaren's Oscar Piastri joined the championship leader provisionally on the front row, with stewards investigating the Australian for possibly impeding Haas's Kevin Magnussen in the first phase of qualifying.

Lando Norris, a first time winner at the previous race in Miami, qualified third for McLaren with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc completing the second row at the Italian team's home circuit.

"We are getting closer. To be ahead of Ferrari is also a nice result for us," said Norris. "It's going to be close, it's going to be a good race tomorrow.

"Hopefully it's an exciting one. Tough, especially when the lap times are so tight. A lot of it is down to lap one, strategy and the pit stops." (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Brighton & Hove Albion coach Roberto De Zerbi will leave the club after their final match of the season against Manchester United, the Premier League club said on Saturday.

De Zerbi joined Brighton in September 2022 when he replaced Graham Potter and made an instant impact when he secured their highest top-flight finish (sixth) and helped them qualify for European competition for the first time.

This season, Brighton reached the last 16 of the Europa League but struggled in the Premier League where they are 10th going into the final day of the season on Sunday.

"Roberto has given us two excellent seasons of service in which he has led the club to new heights, not least our first ever European campaign which will live long in the memory of Albion fans," club chairman Tony Bloom said.

"We have mutually agreed to end Roberto's contract at a time that suits both parties allowing us the earliest opportunity to plan for next season, and Roberto plenty of time to consider his next move and his future."

The Italian manager earned plaudits for an entertaining brand of football based on possession while he also nurtured young talents who were able to thrive in his system even as the club lost major players to bigger teams.

"I am very sad to be leaving Brighton, but I am very proud of what my players and staff have achieved with the support of everyone at the club and our amazing fans in the past two historical seasons," De Zerbi said.

"I have really enjoyed an intense and challenging two years working in the Premier League, not least competing in four major competitions this season. Leaving now provides me with time to take a break before deciding on my future plans." (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Golf world number one Scottie Scheffler was handcuffed and arrested by police early on Friday after allegedly dragging a police officer with his car while trying to avoid traffic controls outside the PGA Championship at Valhalla.

In one of the strangest scenes ever at a major tournament, Scheffler was taken into custody by police, booked with a mugshot taken in an orange jumpsuit, released, then taken back to the course for breakfast and practice before finally teeing off in the second round.

Scheffler was detained by Louisville Metro police after he drove onto curbing to try and get around an accident at the entrance of the golf course, one that resulted in the fatality of a pedestrian, and was confronted by police.

Scheffler was charged with felony assault on a police officer, criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from an officer directing traffic and released on his own recognisance.

While on the driving range preparing to tee off, Scheffler released a statement about the incident.

"This morning, I was proceeding as directed by police officers," Scheffler said. "It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier, and there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do.

"I never intended to disregard any of the instructions.

"I'm hopeful to put this to the side and focus on golf today. Of course, all of us involved in the tournament express our deepest sympathies to the family of the man who passed away in the earlier accident this morning. It truly puts everything into perspective."

A police report on the incident obtained by ESPN said arresting officer Bryan Gillis says Scheffler disobeyed orders to stop his car and accelerated, dragging the officer to the ground.

Gillis was hospitalised with pain, bruising and swelling in his left wrist and knee. An arraignment is set for Tuesday.

Two-time Masters champion Scheffler arrived at Valhalla's clubhouse about 30 minutes after his release and just under an hour before his start time off the 10th tee in the second round, which began after an 80-minute delay due to the accident.

"We were devastated to learn that a worker with one of our vendors was tragically struck and killed by a shuttle bus outside Valhalla Golf Club," the PGA of America said in a statement.

"This is heartbreaking to all of us involved with the PGA Championship."

Scheffler was driven, by the owner of Valhalla Golf Club according to ESPN, to the clubhouse, where he ate breakfast and changed into his golf apparel before going to the practice range to prepare for his round.

"It's a tough deal," said Scheffler playing partner Brian Harman, the 2023 British Open winner. "But I'm glad to see him."

Fans cheered as Scheffler walked through the rain onto the par-5 10th tee and gave him a huge ovation just before he struck his first shot into the right rough on his way to an opening birdie.

Scheffler, who won his second Masters title last month, is trying to become the first player since 2015 to win the first two majors in a calendar year.

SiriusXM PGA Tour Radio reported Scheffler was booked into custody by police at 7:38 a.m. before Scheffler's mugshot in an orange jumpsuit was posted by the Louisville Metropolitan Department of Corrections.

ESPN's Jeff Darlington posted a video on X of Scheffler, wearing shorts and T-shirt, with his hands held behind his back, being led away by police in the pre-dawn incident.

Darlington said Scheffler was unaware a person at the entrance was a police officer because they were clad in a yellow rain poncho.

Scheffler was the feel-good story of the week at Valhalla, hoping to win his third career major title a week after becoming a father for the first time.

His wife, Meredith, gave birth to son Bennett nine days ago.

Scheffler fired a four-under par 67 in Thursday's opening round, but began Friday five strokes adrift of leader Xander Schauffele, the world number three who matched the lowest round in major golf history with a 62 Thursday.

Scheffler, 27, has won four of his past five starts, capturing titles at Bay Hill and the Players in March, losing in a playoff at the Houston Open, then winning the Masters and Heritage crowns last month. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Feyenoord coach Arne Slot confirmed on Friday that he would be replacing Jurgen Klopp as manager of Liverpool next season.

"There hasn't be an official announcement yet – but I don't think it will come as news to you that I will be coach there next season," Feyenoord boss Slot told reporters.

UK media said last month that Slot's deal to replace Klopp was worth up to £9.4 million (10.9 million euros)

Slot moved to Feyenoord in 2021 after impressing in his first managerial role at AZ Alkmaar.

He led the Dutch giants to the inaugural Europa Conference League final at the end of his first season, in which they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma.

Slot then delivered just a second league title in 24 years to De Kuip last season before penning a new three-year deal.

Klopp will step down at the end of this season after a nine-year reign which brought the Champions League title in 2019 and Premier League trophy a year later.

Initially, Bayer Leverkusen boss and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso had been the favourite to succeed Klopp.

However, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Minnesota Timberwolves overwhelmed the Denver Nuggets 115-70 to force the defending NBA champions to a decisive game seven in their Western Conference semifinal series.

Anthony Edwards shook off an injury scare to finish with 27 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals as the young, hungry Timberwolves fended off elimination against Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets, who had won the previous three games to take charge of the best-of-seven series.

Jaden McDaniels scored 21 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 10 points and 13 rebounds. Minnesota finished with a 62-43 advantage in rebounds and the Timberwolves reserves outscored the Nuggets bench 36-9.

The Nuggets will host the winner-take-all game seven on Monday, Hong Kong time.

"I'm super-pumped for it," 22-year-old Edwards said of the chance to eliminate the Nuggets on their home floor.

But McDaniels cautioned that the Nuggets would be ready as well.

"It's not over," McDaniels said. "We're just going to try to keep this intensity for the next game."

With their backs against the wall, the Timberwolves absorbed an early punch, falling behind 9-2 before exploding for a 20-0 scoring run.

They out-scored the Nuggets 31-14 in the first quarter, dominating in the paint and winning the rebounding battle 19-9.

Denver went nearly six minutes without scoring, the crowd at the Target Center in Minneapolis growing more frenzied as the Timberwolves' lead grew.

Another surge by Denver to open the second quarter was quickly repelled with a 13-0 Minnesota run that featured back-to-back baskets from Naz Reid and a three-pointer from Edwards.

Every time the Nuggets looked to be gaining momentum Minnesota responded -- their energy rewarded once again as McDaniels grabbed the rebound from a Reid miss for a second-chance basket at the halftime buzzer, giving the Timberwolves a 59-40 lead at the break.

Timberwolves coach Chris Finch was pleased with a bounce-back performance from his team.

"There were two responses," Finch said. "There was the response to the last three games, but the most important response was when we got down 9-2. And we did a really good job of focusing and coming back with the right energy."

Edwards said he banged his tailbone, but would be ready for Game 7. (AFP)]]>

Jarry, who fought off 11 of 13 break points faced in the match, will next play American 14th seed Tommy Paul on Friday in his first ATP Masters 1000 semi-final.

Another Chilean, Alejandro Tabilo will take on German third seed Alexander Zverev the other semi-final. Two Chileans will appear in the semi-finals of an ATP 1000 event for the first time since the format was introduced in 1990.

Jarry was tested in the opening set by Greece's sixth seed but gained his momentum in the second.

The 28-year-old won five consecutive points at 3-3 as he bounced back from 0-40, before wrapping up the second set by winning nine of the final 11 points.

Jarry then broke Tsitsipas in the decider for a 5-4 lead to eventually cruise into the last four.

Earlier on Thursday, Paul came through a marathon match to beat Polish seventh seed Hubert Hurkacz 7-5 3-6 6-3 to book his spot in the semi-finals.

The American, who defeated defending champion Daniil Medvedev in the previous round, had yet to drop a set before the quarter-final, but Hurkacz managed to force the match into the decider before Paul came out on top.

It was a match which went back and forth with 13 breaks of serve overall. The pair exchanged breaks early in the opening set, with Paul breaking twice to lead 3-2. With Paul serving for the set, Hurkacz broke again to make it 5-5.

Paul broke back immediately and held serve to take the first set. The American made a strong start to the second, breaking in the first game, but Hurkacz came back, breaking twice to force a third set.

This time it was the Pole who took an early 2-0 lead, but they again exchanged breaks of serve to make it 3-3 before Paul made the decisive break to go 5-3 up, and then saved six break points to wrap up victory. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Xander Schauffele set the early target at the PGA Championship, firing a record equalling opening round nine-under 62 at Valhalla Golf Club on Thursday as the Olympic champion looked to atone for a shock loss at the Wells Fargo.

Schauffele, who held a final round two stroke lead at Quail Hollow on Sunday before losing by five shots to Rory McIlroy, was a man on a mission in Louisville and he matched the men's major championship low score – for the second time.

Despite an Olympic gold medal in Tokyo and an proven ability to go low, the 30-year-old American has yet to win a major and is without a win since the 2022 Scottish Open.

While there is a lot of golf to be played, the world number three signalled he plans to end both droughts with a brilliant error-free opening round that matched his first round effort at last year's U.S. Open.

"I'll take a 62 in any major any day," said Schauffele. "Not winning makes you want to win more, as weird as that is.

"The top feels far away, and I feel like I have a lot of work to do."

Perhaps, but Schauffele's 62 will be tough to beat on a sunny day at Valhalla. He is sitting in the clubhouse a comfortable three shots clear of Tony Finau and Sahith Theegala on six-under 65.

Lurking four off the pace on five-under are red hot world number two McIlroy and Scotsman Robert MacIntyre.

McIlroy, coming off back-to-back PGA Tour wins, carried that momentum into the first round. He rolled in a six-footer for a birdie on his opening hole, the par five 10th, then picked up a second at the 13th to briefly join a crowd at the top of the leaderboard.

But the Northern Irishman, who announced on Monday that he had filed for divorce, stalled after the early burst. He took a bogey at the 17th before hitting his stride again after the turn by carding four birdies, including three straight from the fifth coming home.

Defending champion and LIV Golf standard bearer Brooks Koepka, bidding to become the tournament's first repeat winner since he retained the title in 2019, looked a threat to add a fourth Wanamaker trophy to his collection after returning a four-under 67 highlighted by an eagle, birdie, par finish.

Tiger Woods, who collected one of his 15 major titles at Valhalla in 2000 with a playoff win over Bob May, opened with a one-over 72 but lamented a sloppy bogey, bogey finish to his day. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson will miss Sunday's concluding game of the Premier League season and next week's FA Cup final, the club announced on Thursday.

The Brazilian was forced off with a facial injury during City's 2-0 win over Tottenham on Tuesday that left Pep Guardiola's men on the brink of an unprecedented fourth successive English top-flight title.

Scans have confirmed Ederson suffered a small fracture to the right eye socket following a collision with Cristian Romero.

He will now miss Sunday's league game at home to West Ham and the FA Cup final against Manchester United at Wembley the following week.

City, two points clear of Arsenal, will guarantee the Premier League title if they beat West Ham at the Etihad. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[World basketball's governing body, FIBA, said on Thursday that it will bring another major tournament to Hong Kong later this year, with the world's best 3x3 men's teams battling it out for the World Tour title. 

The SAR, which hosted Olympic qualifying last month, will stage the final of the World Tour for the first time on November 23 and 24. 

Matthew Li, media director of the local organising committee, said the top 11 teams in the season will automatically qualify for the Hong Kong Final. 

He added that the team representing Hong Kong will also have a chance to participate if they make it through a play-in tournament against the 12th ranked team and the team with the most combined Challenger and World Tour wins.

Li said the event will also have a 3x3 village with local influences from the Cheung Chau Bun Festival.

"This time we are trying to add some more local culture elements to the carnival. We are trying to make some deal or make some discussion with the authorities in Cheung Chau. We will maybe try to make something different, maybe some local culture things to the November event," he said.

"I think as we will have many more international 3x3 events and also FIBA think we will add a showcase for the tour. We hope it will get more international recognition for Hong Kong as a sport city."

This year's World Tour will feature 17 stops with Ub Huishan NE looking to defend their title as two-time reigning champions.]]>

    <![CDATA[Luka Doncic scored 31 points in a triple-double, and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 104-92 to take a 3-2 lead in the Western Conference semifinal series.

Doncic, the league's leading scorer in the regular season, had struggled some in the series against Oklahoma City. 

Playing through a sprained right knee and a sore left ankle, he had averaged just 22 points on 39% shooting through the first four games. 

But in Game 5, he made 12 of 22 field goals and had 11 assists and 10 rebounds for his sixth career playoff triple-double.

Derrick Jones Jr. scored a playoff career-high 19 points and P.J. Washington Jr. added 10 points and 10 rebounds for Dallas, which shot 52.6% from the floor. The No. 5-seeded Mavericks can advance to the Western Conference finals with a win at home on Sunday morning Hong Kong time.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 30 points for the top-seeded Thunder, but no other Oklahoma City player scored more than 13 points.

The Mavericks won Game 5 on the road, just like they did in the first round against the Los Angeles Clippers. Dallas held Oklahoma City to 42.5% shooting.

Oklahoma City tried to jump-start its struggling offense by replacing Josh Giddey with Isaiah Joe in the starting lineup. Giddey did not start for the first time in 229 combined regular season and postseason games.

Dallas led by 15 in the second quarter and took a 54-44 edge into halftime. Jones scored 15 points before the break.

Gilgeous-Alexander scored 14 points in the third quarter, but Dallas still led 79-67.

The Thunder never got closer than seven points in the final period. (AP)]]>

    Celtics advance to East finals for third straight year

    <![CDATA[Jayson Tatum scored 25 points as the Boston Celtics overpowered the injury-hit Cleveland Cavaliers 113-98 to book their place in the Eastern Conference finals for the third straight year.

The top-seeded Celtics won the series 4-1, yet they were pushed all the way by a battling Cleveland team.

The Cavs' hopes of clawing their way back into the best-of-seven series were rocked before the game as three of their top six players -- Donovan Mitchell, Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert -- were confirmed to be out with injury.

But Cleveland shrugged off that setback to produce a battling performance that saw them get within three points of the Celtics midway through the fourth quarter.

Evan Mobley was superb for Cleveland, pouring in a game-high 33 points while Marcus Morris Sr. added 25 off the bench.

Yet just when Celtics fans at the TD Garden were nervously wondering if a shock defeat was on the cards, Boston stitched together a decisive 13-2 run -- crowned by a three-pointer from Tatum -- that left them ahead by 14 points at 101-87.

Tatum, who also added 10 rebounds and nine assists, said Boston had prepared for a dogfight despite Cleveland's injury-stricken line-up.

"Anybody who's played in this league understands what happens when somebody's best players are out," Tatum said. "The rest of the guys have more freedom. They play with a different level of confidence and they play different.

"Our mindset coming into this game was 'However long it takes, that's how long it takes'. We didn't expect to win the game in the first or second quarter. We grinded it out."

Tatum said Boston were now determined to snap their dismal recent record in the Eastern Conference finals. Boston have lost in the Eastern Conference finals in four of five appearances since the 2016-2017 season.

The superstar forward was one of six Boston players to finish in double figures. Al Horford shrugged off his recent struggles to post 22 points and 15 rebounds, while Derrick White scored 18.

The Celtics will face either the New York Knicks or the Indiana Pacers for a place in the NBA Finals. (AFP)]]>

    Man Utd down Magpies to keep alive European hopes

    <![CDATA[Manchester United kept alive their hopes of salvaging a dismal season by qualifying for Europe as Amad Diallo's rocket inspired a 3-2 win against Newcastle on Wednesday.

Erik ten Hag's side are battling to secure a seventh place finish in the Premier League, which could secure a place in next season's UEFA Conference League.

United will qualify for the Europa League if they win the FA Cup final against Manchester City on May 25.

But if City triumph at Wembley then seventh will be enough for a Conference League spot.

And eighth-placed United are still in the hunt for that place after beating Newcastle to move level on points with the seventh-placed Magpies.

Goals from Kobbie Mainoo, Diallo and Rasmus Hojlund at Old Trafford gave United only their third win in nine league games.

However, United's goal difference is vastly inferior to Newcastle's, meaning they must better the Magpies' result in the last game of the season.

United travel to Brighton on Sunday, while Newcastle head to Brentford.

Newcastle's defeat means fifth-placed Tottenham are guaranteed to be in the Europa League next season.

Sixth placed Chelsea won 2-1 at Brighton in Wednesday's other game to move closer to European qualification after a turbulent campaign.

Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead with the 22nd league goal of his superb season in the 34th minute.

Christopher Nkunku doubled Chelsea's advantage in the 64th minute with his third league goal of an injury-plagued first season with the club.

Mauricio Pochettino's side host Bournemouth on Sunday knowing a draw will be enough to earn a European berth, with fifth place still in play if they win and Tottenham lose at Sheffield United. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Alexander Zverev reached his 18th Masters semi-final in Rome on Wednesday but only after a worrying fall which sparked memories of the horror injury he suffered at the French Open two years ago.

The world number five from Germany defeated Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-3 to set up a last-four duel with Alejandro Tabilo, the Chilean journeyman who had stunned Novak Djokovic earlier in the tournament.

Zverev's moment of concern came in just the third game on centre court at the Foro Italico when he fell on the clay and landed on his front.

The 2017 champion cut his left wrist and a finger in the tumble and required treatment from the tournament physio before he continued the match.

Zverev, 27, suffered a serious ankle injury at the 2022 French Open after falling on the clay of Roland Garros during his semi-final against Rafael Nadal and missed the rest of the season.

On Wednesday, however, he was able to dust himself down to defeat Fritz in 90 minutes, firing 20 winners with six aces and not facing a single break point.

Chile's Tabilo will play his first-ever Masters 1000 semi-final at the age of 26, after seeing off unseeded Zhang Zhizhen of China 6-3, 6-4 in one hour and 26 minutes.

Women's second seed Aryna Sabalenka needed just an hour and 13 minutes to see off Jelena Ostapenko 6-2, 6-4 on her way to the semis, improving her record against her Latvian opponent to three wins and no defeats.

Sabalenka will next take on Miami Open winner Danielle Collins who eased past Victoria Azarenka 6-4, 6-3.

The 26-year-old could get a rematch of the Madrid final which she lost in dramatic fashion to world number one Iga Swiatek earlier this month.

Rome is the first time since the 2013 French Open that the top three women have reached the last four of a WTA event of 250 level or higher, with Swiatek and world number three Coco Gauff in the other semi-final on Thursday. (AFP)]]>

    English Premier League clubs to vote on scrapping VAR

    <![CDATA[Premier League clubs will be given the chance to scrap VAR from next season when they vote on the controversial review system at their annual general meeting next month.

Wolves have submitted a resolution to abolish VAR to the Premier League, triggering a vote of the top flight's 20 teams on June 6.

The Molineux club said VAR is "undermining the value of the Premier League brand" after another season marred by a host of debatable decisions.

In order for VAR to be axed by the Premier League, 14 of the 20 clubs will have to vote against it.

Wolves are expected to canvas other clubs in order to gain support before the meeting.

VAR was introduced in the Premier League in 2019 with the aim of helping referees avoid clear and obvious errors that had marred matches in the past.

But there have been numerous controversies surrounding the technology this season as Premier League managers and fans grow increasingly vocal in their disdain for the system.

"The introduction of VAR in 2019/20 was a decision made in good faith and with the best interests of football and the Premier League at its heart," a Wolves statement said.

"However, it has led to numerous unintended negative consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football, and undermining the value of the Premier League brand.

"The decision to table the resolution has come after careful consideration and with the utmost respect for the Premier League, PGMOL and our fellow competitors.

"Our position is that the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy is at odds with the spirit of our game, and as a result we should remove it from the 2024/25 season onwards."

Wolves boss Gary O'Neil revealed he has regularly received apologetic phone calls from Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) chief Howard Webb after VAR decisions that went against his team.

The impact of VAR on goal celebrations, the length of time taken for checks and a lack of communication in the stadium are all issues that have irked supporters and cited by Wolves as reasons for scrapping the system.

However, the Premier League believes VAR is still a valuable tool.

The English top flight, which is in regular dialogue with referees' governing body PGMOL, believes the number of incorrect decisions would increase without VAR which could damage the competition's reputation.

"The Premier League can confirm it will facilitate a discussion on VAR with our clubs at the Annual General Meeting next month," a Premier League spokesperson said.

"Clubs are entitled to put forward proposals at Shareholders' meetings and we acknowledge the concerns and issues around the use of VAR.

"However, the League fully supports the use of VAR and remains committed, alongside PGMOL, to make continued improvements to the system for the benefit of the game and fans." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Former SAR football internationals Lam Ka-wai and Lo Kwan-yee received the perfect send-offs before their retirement as they led Hong Kong Rangers to a 1-0 victory against Kitchee in the Sapling Cup final on Wednesday.

Rangers still have a game to go in the Premier League season, but the veterans decided to make the cup final at Mong Kok Stadium their last game before hanging up their boots.

Midfielder Lam, a traditional number ten, captained underdogs Rangers, who took the lead late in the first half when striker Nassam Ibrahim scored a header from close range.

Defender Lo, 39, came on as a substitute in the second half to fortify Rangers’ defence, which stubbornly turned away the Kitchee advances for a magical victory.

After the game, Lam, 38, thanked both Rangers and Kitchee, a club he also spent more than a decade with, for giving him the opportunities as a player.

The playmaker said he was particularly grateful to his mother club Rangers.

“After Covid, I was a jobless footballer for a period of time. They quickly called me and asked me to join the team,” Lam said. 

Lo, for his part, said jokingly he’s upset that Lam didn’t thank him. But he wanted to thank his teammate anyway, saying they’ve gone through so much together in their careers.

Lam was capped 51 times by Hong Kong, China, scoring nine goals. Lo also found the net nine times during the 53 games he represented the SAR.]]>
