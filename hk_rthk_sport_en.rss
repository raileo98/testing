    Pacers thrash Bucks to clinch NBA playoff series

    <![CDATA[The Indiana Pacers powered into the second round of the NBA playoffs on Thursday, thrashing the depleted Milwaukee Bucks 120-98 to win their Eastern Conference series 4-2.

Unable to close out the Bucks on Tuesday, the Pacers got their uptempo offense flowing again, relentlessly pulling away after trailing by seven in the opening minutes.

All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton delivered a double-double of 17 points and 10 assists, but it was reserve guard Obi Toppin leading the Pacers scoring with a career playoff high 21 points.

T.J. McConnell added 20 points off the bench along with nine assists and four steals as the Pacers reserves contributed a whopping 50 points.

"I'm so proud of the perseverance," Haliburton said of Toppin and McConnell. "Obviously neither of them had a really good game last game -- none of us did. We just responded the right way."

Indiana led by 12 at halftime, and after the Bucks cut the deficit to seven on a Brook Lopez layup with 1:05 left in the third the Pacers authored an 11-0 scoring run and romped away in the final period.

Eight-time All-Star Damian Lillard returned from a two-game injury absence and led the Bucks with 28 points.

Lopez and Bobby Portis scored 20 points apiece, but with two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo still sidelined by the calf injury suffered late in the regular season the Bucks couldn't find an answer.

The Bucks, who won the title in 2021, lost in the first round for the second straight season after falling to Miami last year.

The Pacers hadn't won a playoff series since 2014, when they reached the Eastern Conference finals.

In the Eastern Conference semi-finals Indiana will take on either the second-seeded New York Knicks or the Philadelphia 76ers, who clashed later Thursday in Philadelphia with the Sixers trying to stave off elimination. (AFP)]]>

    Chelsea shatter Spurs' top four bid

    <![CDATA[Pinpoint headed goals from Trevoh Chalobah and Nicolas Jackson earned Chelsea a 2-0 victory over London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Thursday, dealing a blow to Spurs' hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League.

Former academy defender Chalobah diverted the ball expertly into the top corner from a Conor Gallagher free kick 35 metres out in the 24th minute.

It gave Chelsea a deserved lead after sustained pressure from the home side with chances for Mykhailo Mudryk, Marc Cucurella and Noni Madueke. Spurs defender Micky van de Ven kept his side in the match, with last-ditch tackles in the area and a clearance off the line.

Tottenham's Australian coach Ange Postecoglou looked furious in the dugout throughout the first 45 minutes and his side came out of the second half with greater verve and determination.

But efforts by Son Heung-min and Pedro Porro were blocked and saved.

Senegal's Jackson calmed home nerves against the run of play in the 72nd minute when he was on hand to head home after a free kick from Chelsea top scorer Cole Palmer hit the bar and bounced down.

The three points, taking them to eighth, were vital for the push by Chelsea, under former Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino, towards a Europa League place after a disappointing season but left Tottenham seven points adrift of the top four.

"We are in a good place," Pochettino said. "We have amazing professionals working on set-pieces. The team really showed in the way we wanted to build this way to play."

He described the first half as fantastic. "Then you have to contain and suffer."

Postecoglou took responsibility for the defeat.

"I feel like we've lost a bit of belief and conviction in our football and that is on me to change that," he said. "We were nowhere near good enough. That is on me."

Tottenham have a poor record against their southwest London rivals. They lost the home fixture last November 4-1 and have won only one of their last 10 meetings. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Defending Madrid Open champion Aryna Sabalenka produced a brilliant comeback from a set and a break down to beat Elena Rybakina and reach the final on Thursday.

The Belarusian second seed triumphed 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 [7/5] and will face world number one Iga Swiatek on Saturday in a rematch of last year's final.

The clinical Swiatek earlier eased past American Madison Keys with a comfortable 6-1, 6-3 victory.

In the men's draw third seed Daniil Medvedev retired injured from his quarter-final clash with Jiri Lehecka.

Sabalenka, 25, sealed her victory with a typically powerful serve that Rybakina could not control.

The big-hitter had lost three of her last four clashes against the 24-year-old but emerged triumphant as they met on clay for the first time.

Swiatek has a 6-3 record against Sabalenka but in their only match in the Spanish capital, the latter triumphed in three sets a year ago to claim the title.

Dominant on clay, Swiatek barely put a foot wrong against Keys, making just eight unforced errors in the match to leave the 29-year-old American with virtually no chance.

Russia's Medvedev struggled through to the end of the first set against Lehecka with an apparent upper thigh problem, losing it 6-4 before retiring.

The Czech progressed to his first Masters 1000 semi-final, where he will face Felix Auger Aliassime, who received a walkover after top seed Jannik Sinner withdrew Wednesday with a hip problem.

Taylor Fritz will face Andrey Rublev in the other semi-final on Friday, after the Russian ousted home favourite Carlos Alcaraz on Wednesday. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Boston Celtics crushed the Miami Heat 118-84 to complete an emphatic 4-1 series victory Wednesday and book their place in the second round of the NBA playoffs.

The postseason top seeds – upset by Miami in last year's Eastern Conference finals – avenged that loss in spectacular fashion with a one-sided wire-to-wire rout at the TD Garden.

Jaylen Brown and Derrick White scored 25 points apiece to lead Boston, who barely noticed the absence of the injured Kristaps Porzingis.

The Celtics threw down the gauntlet in the first quarter, racking up a whopping 41 points to open up a commanding 18-point advantage.

They extended that lead to 22 points by half-time, and kept up the pressure in the third quarter to lead 98-66 heading into the final frame.

Boston head coach Joe Mazzulla could afford to rest his frontline players for the fourth with the game effectively won against an injury-hit Miami team missing Jimmy Butler and Jaime Jaquez Jr.

Boston will now face either the fourth-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers or fifth seeds Orlando in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. Cleveland lead that series 3-2.

The Celtics advance into the next series brimming with confidence after ruthlessly taking care of eighth-seeded Miami in five games.

White's 25-point haul included five three-pointers while Jayson Tatum added 16 points including 12 rebounds with three assists.

Sam Hauser added 17 points off the bench while Jrue Holiday also cracked double figures with 10 points.

Bam Adebayo led Miami's scoring with 23 points, with Tyler Herro finishing with 15 and Caleb Martin 10. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Ten cricket pitches have completed their journey up the East Coast of the United States from Florida to New York state and are being installed in a new stadium built for next month's T20 World Cup.

The "drop in pitches" have been prepared in Florida since December and were recently transported by 20 trailer trucks to the venue in Long Island.

The surfaces, which will soon be used for games including the highly-anticipated clash between cricket giants India and Pakistan, were developed by Australian Damian Hough, curator of the Adelaide Oval.

Winter conditions in New York meant that the grass needed to be grown in the warmer climate of Florida before being transported and installed.

Hough said the journey from the base in Boynton Beach, Florida, to Nassau County in New York state, took over 24 hours, with regular stops for checks and hydration of the grass.

The temporary 34,000 capacity stadium at Eisenhower Park has already been built with stands and hospitality areas already in place and the outfield has been put in place.

Hough said the surface is likely to be typical of the kind used for T20 matches, where fans expect to see big shots from the batsmen.

"Our ambition is to produce pitches along the lines where they're good quality pitches, minimal spin, minimal seam and ball coming onto the bat and let the players play the shot," he said.

The first World Cup game at the venue will feature Sri Lanka v South Africa on June 3 but organisers are planning some test events before then.

Much of the material for the stands has been taken from Formula One motor racing and will be dismantled after the end of the World Cup.

But the international standard playing surface will remain in place with the possibility of it being used for local cricket. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Milwaukee pitchers Abner Uribe and Freddy Peralta and Brewers manager Pat Murphy were suspended along with Tampa Bay outfielder Jose Siri by Major League Baseball Wednesday for their roles in a brawl.

Uribe was suspended for six games and Peralta for five, with both players launching an appeal to shorten the punishment.

The Rays said Siri would appeal his three-game suspension while Murphy served the first game of his two-game ban on Wednesday, when the Brewers beat the Rays 7-1 in Milwaukee.

All four were ejected from the Brewers' 8-2 victory over the Rays on Tuesday.

With one out in the sixth inning, an errant fastball from Peralta hit Siri – who had homered earlier – in the left thigh.

That led to Peralta, and an incensed Murphy being ejected.

When Siri came to the plate in the eighth he hit a ground ball that was tossed to pitcher Abner Uribe covering first base – where the two traded swings that brought players racing from both dugouts. Siri and Uribe were ejected after order was restored.

"I could tell that something was being said," plate umpire Chris Guccione said. "We tried to get in there to break them up, but it happened so fast that it blew up." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Ronnie O'Sullivan's bid to capture a record eighth world snooker title came crashing down on Wednesday when he was knocked out in the quarter-finals by Stuart Bingham.

Bingham, the 2015 champion, came through 13-10 and will face Welsh qualifier Jak Jones for a place in the final.

Jones stunned former champion Judd Trump 13-9 in his quarter-final.

"I had a little cry in my dressing room, I was fearing the worst," said Bingham.

"I don't know how I've held myself together."

Bingham, who has lost his place in the world's top 16, pulled away from an increasingly agitated O'Sullivan, reeling off the final three frames to seal a nerve-jangling win.

"I'm actually really happy to be honest, it's just the way it goes sometimes," O'Sullivan said.

"I feel like I'm actually getting through the ball, which is more important to me at this stage. It's been a worrying couple of years.

"Not the win I'd have liked to have had, but that's snooker. That's the way it goes. Good luck to Stuart." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Niclas Fuellkrug gave Borussia Dortmund a 1-0 home win over Paris Saint-Germain in their Champions League semi-final first leg on Wednesday.

Seeking a return to the final for the first time since 2013, the 1997 winners were dogged and determined, outmuscling their heavily favoured opponents.

Fuellkrug, playing in his first Champions League season at the age of 31, collected a lofted pass from centre-back Nico Schlotterbeck in the 36th minute and blasted a low shot into the left corner of the net.

PSG, led by Kylian Mbappe, hit the post twice in quick succession early in the second-half but could not break through.

Dortmund, who had already lost and drawn against PSG this season in the group stage, can continue to dream of a return to Wembley 11 years after their last Champions League final.

Despite the setback, however, PSG will remain confident of overturning the deficit at home next week against a side they thoroughly outclassed at their home venue in September.

Dortmund manager Edin Terzic said pre-match PSG were "built to win the Champions League" since the Qatari takeover a decade ago.

Nowhere was the contrast between the two clubs greater than PSG's global superstar Mbappe, playing in his last season for his hometown club, and journeyman Dortmund striker Fuellkrug, who was playing second-division football this time two years ago.

The victory, along with Tuesday's 2-2 draw between Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in the other semi-final, guarantees Germany rather than England or France an extra Champions League place for next season.

That has already secured Dortmund's place in the competition next season (AFP)]]>

    Alcaraz crashes, Sinner hobbles out of Madrid

    <![CDATA[Second-seeded Carlos Alcaraz saw his title defence and 14-match winning streak in Madrid come to an end at the hands of Andrey Rublev in the quarter-finals on Wednesday while top-seeded Jannik Sinner withdrew from the tournament citing a right hip injury.

Rublev upset home favourite Alcaraz 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 to reach the semi-finals.

Alcaraz missed the clay-court tournaments in Monte Carlo and Barcelona last month due to a forearm injury and needed a third-set tiebreak to squeeze past last year's finalist Jan-Lennard Struff in the fourth round on Tuesday.

He couldn't hold off an inspired Rublev though, his quest to become the first man to win three consecutive titles in Madrid coming to a crashing halt.

Sinner was due to face Felix Auger-Aliassime in the quarter-finals on Thursday but revealed he has been battling through a hip issue this week in the Spanish capital.

"My hip has been bothering me this week and has slowly been getting more painful. Taking the advice from the doctors we decided it's best to not play further and make it worse," wrote Sinner in a statement on social media.

Sinner is due to play on home ground at the Italian Open in Rome next week before heading for an assault on the French Open, the season's second major, which starts in Paris on May 26.

Elena Rybakina battled back from 2-5 down in the deciding set and saved two match points to overcome Yulia Putintseva 4-6, 7-6 [7/4], 7-5 and reach the semi-finals of the WTA event.

A late-match collapse from Putintseva, who smashed her racquet and left it on court after the match, helped Rybakina advance to her sixth semi-final of the season, where she will face defending champion Aryna Sabalenka.

Australian Open champion Sabalenka picked up a 10th consecutive victory in Madrid with a 6-1, 6-4 win against 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva.

Sabalenka is 5-3 lifetime against Rybakina but lost three of their last four meetings, most recently in the Brisbane final in January. Their Madrid semi-final will be their first encounter on clay. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Real Madrid's Vinicius Jr scored twice, including a late penalty, to snatch a 2-2 draw at Bayern Munich in an entertaining Champions League semi-final, first leg on Tuesday, leaving the tie wide open.

The Brazilian, who put Real in front after 24 minutes, has now scored in the semi-finals for a third successive season.

Bayern, with only the Champions League title left to fight for, had scored twice in four minutes early in the second half through a Leroy Sane strike and Harry Kane penalty to turn the game around before Vinicius' spot kick.

"We always want to win but we know that this competition is like that, you can't give away balls because teams score the chances they have," Vinicius Jr said. "We have to keep our heads calm, rest until next week and we know that we and the fans are going to leave everything at the Santiago Bernabeu to qualify."

"Now it's time for a magical night at home to win and secure our place in the final," he added.

Facing each other for a record eighth time at this stage of the competition, it was Bayern who got off to a strong start, racking up half a dozen attempts on goal by the 15th minute with Sane and Kane coming close.

Real needed only one chance to score though, stunning the home crowd against the run of play when Kroos sliced open the Bayern defence with a through ball and Vinicius Jr chased it down to beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.

Kroos almost added another himself in the 51st but his curled shot was palmed wide by Neuer. Instead, it was Bayern who scored two minutes later with a solo effort and shot from Sane that eluded goalkeeper Andriy Lunin for a deserved equaliser.

Their comeback was complete in the 57th when Jamal Musiala was brought down in the area by Lucas Vazquez and Kane sent Lunin the wrong way from the spot to put the home side ahead.

Real, chasing a 15th European Cup, levelled in the 83rd with Vinicius' penalty, after Rodrygo was felled by a clumsy challenge from Kim Min-jae, to set up a mouth-watering return leg in Madrid next week.

"Everything we're fighting for is in this competition," said Kane. "We've just got to find a way to get it done. Real Madrid away is going to be tough but we've got to go there with full belief and go for the win."

The winners will face either Borussia Dortmund or Paris St Germain, who meet in the second semi-final on Wednesday. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Second seed Carlos Alcaraz extended his Madrid Open winning streak to a record-equalling 14 with a hard-fought victory over familiar foe Jan-Lennard Struff to move into the quarter-finals on Tuesday.

In a rematch of last year's final at the Caja Magica, Alcaraz snapped Struff's six-match winning streak with a 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (7/4) result to squeeze through to a last-eight clash with seventh seed Andrey Rublev.

Top-seeded Jannik Sinner has been dealing with a hip problem but managed to overcome Karen Khachanov 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 to reach his fourth Masters 1000 quarter-final in as many events this season.

Alcaraz, who missed Monte Carlo and Barcelona with a forearm injury, saved eight out of 10 break points and saw four match points come and go before he completed the two-hour 52-minute win.

"How much I've missed this! Quarters next," wrote the former world number one on the camera lens after the match.

Alcaraz, who is now 24-0 on Spanish clay since the start of the 2022 season, is bidding to become the first player to win three consecutive Madrid titles.

After blowing a 2-0 lead in the second set, Alcaraz opened up a 3-1 advantage in the tiebreak, only to lose the next five points and go on to surrender the set to Struff, who came into the tournament on the back of a maiden ATP title run in Munich.

A break of serve in the fourth game of the decider gave Alcaraz the score cushion he needed but the two-time Grand Slam champion was broken while serving for the victory from 40-0 up at 5-3.

Struff saved four match points and the contest fittingly went to a deciding tiebreak. Alcaraz let a 3-0 lead slip, but he got his hands on more match points by landing an inch-perfect lob and he closed on his fifth opportunity of the match.

"This match reminds me of last year's. It was a great fight," said Alcaraz after matching Rafael Nadal's record winning streak in Madrid.

"It was difficult for me to deal with my emotions, to handle difficult moments. Serving for the match, it was really difficult for me to get broken after being 40-0 up, but I'm really happy that at the end it didn't affect me and my mentality and I kept fighting." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Oklahoma City Thunder sealed a 4-0 series sweep of the New Orleans Pelicans to book their place in the NBA playoffs second round on Monday as Boston dominated Miami to move to the brink of the conference semi-finals.

Western Conference top seeds Oklahoma City finally got the better of New Orleans with a late scoring burst in the fourth quarter to complete a 97-89 road victory in Louisiana.

The Pelicans led by five points with just over eight minutes remaining before Oklahoma City responded with an 18-2 run to close out victory in a hard-fought contest that saw the lead change hands 19 times.

Jalen Williams and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder scoring with 24 points apiece while Chet Holmgren and Josh Giddey each scored 14 and Luguentz Dort 11.

It was the Thunder's first playoff series win since 2016 and leaves them facing a Western Conference semi-final against either the Los Angeles Clippers or Dallas Mavericks.

Elsewhere on Monday, Derrick White scored 38 points as the top-seeded Boston Celtics scored a dominant 102-88 road victory over the Miami Heat to take a commanding 3-1 lead in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference series.

After an enthusiastic 20-point win over Miami in game three on Saturday, Boston picked up where they left off with another emphatic performance over last season's Eastern Conference champions.

White set the tone for Boston with an electric first quarter display, rattling in 16 points in the opening frame – including four three-pointers – to help the Celtics take a 10-point lead heading into the second quarter.

Boston then kept up the pressure with the scoreboard ticking over to open up a 53-36 half-time lead.

The Celtics stretched the lead to 28 points at one stage in the third quarter, and even though Miami rallied in the fourth, narrowing the deficit to 13 points with just over five minutes remaining, Boston's grip on the lead never looked in serious jeopardy.

The win means the Celtics can clinch their place in the second round, where they will face either Orlando or Cleveland, with a win in game five on Wednesday back in Boston.

On Monday's evidence, few would bet against Boston bringing the series to a swift conclusion. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[Three-time Super Bowl champion tight end Travis Kelce, better known to many as singer Taylor Swift's sweetheart, said on Monday he has signed a two-year contract extension with the Kansas City Chiefs.

The 34-year-old signed a deal to stay with the Chiefs through 2027 for US$34.25 million and become the NFL's highest-paid tight end, according to multiple reports.

"Back at it again baby," Kelce said in a video posted by the Chiefs on X, formerly Twitter.

"Feels good to be in KC. I remember coming here 12 years ago, man. It's an honour and a pleasure and I can't wait to get after it these next two years but no better than right now getting fired up for this year.

"Just got out on the field with the boys. We're back at it baby. Chiefs forever."

Kelce just missed an eighth consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season in 2023, catching 93 passes for 984 yards and five touchdowns this past campaign.

"I told yall I'll never let him leave!! Congrats my guy! @tkelce," Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes posted on X.

In 159 career games over 11 NFL seasons, all with the Chiefs, Kelce has caught 907 passes for 11,328 yards and 74 touchdowns

"We signed the greatest tight end ever to a new contract," the Chiefs posted on X.

Kelce has caught an NFL record 165 passes in the playoffs for 1,903 yards and 19 touchdowns for a Chiefs squad that has reached the AFC Championship six consecutive years and the Super Bowl in four of the past five seasons.

The Chiefs won their second Super Bowl in a row in February and also won the 2020 Super Bowl.

Swift attended many of Kelce's games, often watching alongside his mother, bringing the NFL and Chiefs in particular extra attention from Swift's devoted fan following. (AFP)]]>

    Premier League clubs agree new spending cap - reports

    <![CDATA[Premier League clubs have reportedly agreed in principle to introduce a spending cap to limit the gap in financial muscle between sides at the top and bottom of the English top flight.

Clubs will be limited to spending a multiple of the amount of money accrued in television rights by the lowest-earning club in the Premier League.

The Athletic reported "the anchoring" plan will be capped at five times the amount the lowest earning side receives via the Premier League's broadcast deals.

Official figures for last season show the bottom club, Southampton, were paid £104 million (US$130 million) in TV money.

The Times said that clubs are expected to be assured that any cap would not cause any of them to reduce spending from their present level.

The plan received at least the 14 votes necessary from the 20 clubs to be approved.

But defending champions Manchester City, Manchester United and Aston Villa are among those to have reportedly rejected the proposal, with Chelsea said to have abstained.

If approved at an annual general meeting in June, the new model will replace the controversial Profit and Sustainability Regulations (PSR) from the 2025-26 season.

Everton and Nottingham Forest have been docked points this season due to breaches of PSR, which allows clubs to lose only £105 million over a three-year period.

A number of other clubs are close to crossing that limit, which led to a massive downturn in spending during the January transfer window.

Critics of a cap on spending believe it could hinder the Premier League's position as the richest and most watched league in the world.

Players' union the Professional Footballers' Association have also opposed "any measure that would place a 'hard' cap on player wages."

However, those in favour of the plans cite increasing Champions League revenue for the top teams and the spending power of state-backed clubs such as City and Newcastle as justification for limiting spending to maintain a competitive balance.

Premier League clubs have already agreed to follow Uefa's new financial fair play regulations from 2025/26 by limiting spending to 85 percent of their total revenue on wages, transfer payments and agents' fees. (AFP)]]>

    Rubiales denies 'irregularities' in graft case

    <![CDATA[Disgraced former Spanish football federation chief Luis Rubiales denied any financial "irregularities" on Monday after testifying in court in a corruption probe into his time in charge.

"What I maintain, and will always maintain, and I am convinced that justice will (demonstrate), is there has never been any money received in an irregular way," Rubiales told reporters after leaving the Madrid court.

Rubiales, 46, who resigned following global outrage after he forcibly kissed Women's World Cup star Jenni Hermoso on the lips last summer after the final, testified at length.

"I have answered all the questions I was asked, if I have to come here again I will be here, collaborating – I am the one most interested in clearing everything up," said Rubiales.

Rubiales must appear in court every month and ask permission from the judge before making any trips outside of Spain.

He was briefly detained on his return to Spain from the Dominican Republic at the start of April as part of a probe into federation (RFEF) contracts signed since 2018, including one signed by Rubiales to take the Spanish Super Cup to Saudi Arabia.

"There has never been any irregular tender, we have been paid with the utmost excellence and in the pursuit of legality," added Rubiales.

On March 20 investigators searched Rubiales' house in the southern city of Granada among 11 locations in the alleged graft scandal.

The raids were part of "an investigation linked to presumed crimes linked with corruption in business, fraudulent administration and money laundering," according to judicial sources.

The Super Cup contracts are worth 40 million euros a year (US$43.3 million) with the deal brokered by Kosmos, a company owned by former Barcelona and Spain defender Gerard Pique.

The Spanish Super Cup took place for the first time in Saudi Arabia in 2020.

It returned to Spain for a year during the Covid-19 pandemic but the subsequent three editions have returned to the oil-rich Gulf state.

New Spanish football president Pedro Rocha is also under investigation in the alleged graft case.

Rocha served as federation vice-president under Rubiales, then replaced him on an interim basis before being elected as chief this week.

Rubiales is also set to go on trial over the non-consensual kiss on Hermoso's lips, which under Spanish law can be classed as sexual assault. (AFP)]]>

    McIlroy and Lowry triumph in PGA New Orleans playoff

    <![CDATA[Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry won the PGA Tour's Zurich Classic of New Orleans team event on Sunday after a playoff win over Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer.

The USA-French pairing of Ramey and Martin had started the day of foursomes [alternate shot] seven strokes off the lead but a brilliant nine-under par round of 63 saw them fly to the top of the leaderboard.

That left the final groups under some pressure to reach the target of 25-under and only McIlroy and Lowry, who played together on the Irish Olympic team and for Europe in the Ryder Cup, were able to get there.

After Lowry, the 2019 British Open champion, missed a par putt on the 17th, the Irish pair knew they needed to make birdie on the 18th to get into a playoff by tying the clubhouse leaders.

World number two McIlroy blasted his drive down the fairway and after Lowry's approach shot left him some work to do, the Northern Irishman produced a wonderful chip that left Lowry with a straightforward five footer for birdie.

Ramey and Trainer had been off the course for three hours and it perhaps showed on the first playoff hole, the 18th.

French-born Trainer drove to just behind a fairway bunker but teammate Ramey's 3-wood was hooked far left and after Trainer's chip was short, Ramey missed his putt from off the green, meaning par was the best they could get.

Lowry's approach shot had ended up in a greenside bunker but McIlroy got it safely on to the green and left Lowry with a chance at birdie and victory.

Lowry has conceded that he has been struggling on the greens of late and he missed the seven-foot putt, leaving Trainer with a putt to extend the playoff.

But Trainer missed to hand victory to the Irish pairing.

The win was McIlroy's 25th on the PGA Tour while for Lowry it was his third and his first at a PGA Tour sanctioned event since his British Open triumph at Portrush. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Carlos Alcaraz passed a "test of fire" to breeze into the Madrid Open last 16 with a straight sets victory over Thiago Seyboth Wild on Sunday, while Aryna Sabalenka staved off teenager Robin Montgomery to progress in three sets.

Double defending champion Alcaraz came through 6-3, 6-3 and will face last year's runner-up Jan-Lennard Struff in the next round after another impressive showing before adoring fans on home soil.

World number three Alcaraz, 20, missed a month prior to Madrid with a forearm issue but returned to crush Alexander Shevchenko in the second round and looks in fine shape ahead of the French Open, the second Grand Slam event of the season.

Still wearing a protective sleeve on his right arm, he had far too much for Seyboth Wild, who had ousted 28th seed Lorenzo Musetti.

German fourth seed Alexander Zverev, the 2018 and 2021 Madrid champion, made the last 16 with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Canada's Denis Shapovalov.

Andrey Rublev came back from 5-0 down in a first set tie-break to beat Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-6 [12/10], 6-4 in a tense affair.

Women's world number two Sabalenka scraped past plucky 19-year-old Montgomery 6-1, 6-7 [5/7], 6-4 in a two-and-a-half hour tussle.

Sabalenka broke twice for a 5-1 lead against Montgomery, who steeled herself and battled well in the final game, saving three set points before Sabalenka sealed it.

World number four Elena Rybakina eased to a 6-1, 6-4 win over Egypt's Mayar Sherif to reach the last 16.

Mirra Andreeva defeated Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 7-5, 6-1 to return to the last 16 for the second year running.

The Russian, who turns 17 on Monday, won 25 points to nine in the second set against the world number seven from the Czech Republic. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[James Harden and Paul George combined for 66 points as the Los Angeles Clippers survived a 31-point Dallas comeback bid on Sunday, leveling their NBA playoff series as New York took a 3-1 lead over Philadelphia behind Jalen Brunson's 47 points.

The Clippers squared their best-of-seven Western Conference first-round series at 2-2 with a 116-111 triumph in Dallas, but not before the Mavs erased a 31-point deficit.

George scored 26 of his 33 points in the first half to help the Clippers build their big lead despite the injury absence of Kawhi Leonard.

Harden scored 15 of his 33 in the fourth quarter, when Dallas – led by the star duo of Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic – threatened to match the biggest comeback win in NBA playoff history.

Irving scored 40 points for Dallas, including a driving layup through traffic with 2:14 to play that gave the Mavs their first lead since the first quarter at 104-103.

Doncic delivered a triple-double of 29 points plus 10 rebounds and 10 assists, but in the waning minutes it was George, Harden and the Clippers who came through.

In Philadelphia, Brunson broke the New York franchise record for points in a playoff game and added 10 assists as the Knicks pushed reigning NBA Most valuable Player Joel Embiid and the Sixers to the brink of elimination in their Eastern Conference series.

OG Anunoby had 16 points and 14 rebounds while putting in an impressive defensive effort against Embiid.

Josh Hart grabbed 17 rebounds but scored only four points as, apart from Brunson, the Knicks struggled offensively. 

In Indianapolis, the Indiana Pacers drilled 22 three-pointers in a 126-113 victory over the short-handed Milwaukee Bucks to take a 3-1 series lead.

Myles Turner hit a playoff career high of seven three-pointers on the way to 29 points and Tyrese Haliburton added 24 points for the Pacers, who had six players in double figures.

The Bucks, with superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo still sidelined by a calf injury, were also without injured Damian Lillard and saw Bobby Portis ejected in the first quarter after a scuffle with Andrew Nembhard after the two tangled under the basket.

Brook Lopez scored 27 points and Khris Middleton, who tweaked an ankle in the third quarter but stayed in the game, had 25 for the Bucks, who will try to stay alive when they host game five on Tuesday. (AFP)

    Man City see off Forest to close on leaders Arsenal

    <![CDATA[Manchester City overcame relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest 2-0 on Sunday to close to within one point of Premier League leaders Arsenal and keep the destiny of the title race in their own hands.

Mikel Arteta's team had thrown down the gauntlet earlier in the day, fending off a Tottenham fightback to win 3-2, briefly moving four points clear of City.

But the champions – chasing an unprecedented fourth straight English top-flight title – saw off a spirited Forest, with goals from Josko Gvardiol and Erling Haaland in either half.

Forest – fighting for their lives – will rue missed chances, including two clear-cut opportunities for Chris Wood.

City remain firm favourites to land yet another league title with four games remaining – one more than Arsenal.

Third-placed Liverpool are four points behind City having played a game more and are realistically out of the title picture.

Forest, last month docked four points for breaches of Premier League financial rules, remain just one point outside the relegation zone with three games to go.

Pep Guardiola's City, who came into the match on the back of a 30-match unbeaten run in all competitions, did not have it all their own way at the City ground.

The home team had a chance to take a shock lead in the opening seconds but Neco Williams failed to make clean contact from close range.

Forest looked dangerous when they came forward, with Nathan Ake forced to stretch to keep the ball off the toes of Callum Hudson-Odoi.

But City took the lead in the 32nd minute when Gvardiol powered home a Kevin De Bruyne corner at the near post.

Forest, undaunted, continued to test City but Wood missed a glorious chance to level from close range when found by substitute Gonzalo Montiel, getting his feet in a tangle.

Guardiola made two changes at half-time, bringing on goalkeeper Stefan Ortega for Ederson, who had a shoulder issue, and introducing Mateo Kovacic for Jeremy Doku.

Forest were quickly out of the traps but Wood again had a moment to forget after Antony Elanga skipped past Kyle Walker into the penalty box.

Elanga found the New Zealand international but he scuffed his shot and it was blocked easily.

City began to take more control as the second period wore on.

Haaland, who has been short of his razor-sharp best in recent weeks, came on for Jack Grealish shortly after the hour mark.

He eased City's nerves minutes later, latching onto a De Bruyne through ball, evading Murillo before finding the net for his 21st Premier League goal of the season. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Arsenal held on for a pulsating 3-2 win over arch rivals Tottenham in the north London derby to keep their grip on top spot in the Premier League on Sunday.

Bidding to stay one step ahead of Manchester City in the title race, Mikel Arteta's side silenced the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with a three-goal blast before half-time.

Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's own goal put Arsenal ahead before Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz netted to leave Arsenal in complete control.

Cristian Romero and Son Heung-min struck for Tottenham after the interval to set up a nervous finish, but Arsenal clung on by their finger tips.

Arsenal sit four points clear of second placed City, who face struggling Nottingham Forest later on Sunday in the first of two games in hand over the Gunners.

City will clinch an unprecedented fourth successive English title if they win their last five matches.

But Arsenal are doing all they can to make Pep Guardiola's team sweat as they try to make amends for blowing an eight-point lead in last season's title race.

After the despair of a damaging home defeat against Aston Villa and a Champions League quarter-final exit to Bayern Munich, the Gunners have bounced back impressively.

Aware they have little margin for error with City chasing them, Arteta had called on his players to show their hunger for success and they responded to his challenge.

Thrashing old foes Chelsea 5-0 on Tuesday was merely the appetiser ahead of the main course Arsenal served up for 3,000 of their jubilant fans packed into one corner of the stadium.

Arsenal famously won the league twice at Tottenham's old White Hart Lane stadium, in 1971 and 2004.

The Gunners could not clinch silverware on enemy territory this time, but their fifth win in the last seven north London derbies kept them in the hunt to win the title for the first time in 20 years.

Defeat was a bitter blow for fifth-placed Tottenham, who are seven points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa with two games in hand to keep alive their fading hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.

Playing for the first time since a 4-0 defeat at Newcastle 15 days ago, Tottenham should have been fresher than an Arsenal team in action four times over that period.

In Sunday's other early kick-off, Bournemouth beat Brighton 3-0 through goals from Marcos Senesi, Enes Unai and Justin Kluivert. (AFP)]]>
