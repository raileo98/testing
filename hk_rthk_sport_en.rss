    <![CDATA[West Ham manager David Moyes will leave "by mutual consent" when his contract expires at the end of the season, the Premier League club said on Monday.

The announcement of Moyes's impending exit came just a day after the Hammers suffered an embarrassing 5-0 loss to London rivals Chelsea.

"West Ham United can confirm David Moyes will leave the club by mutual consent at the end of the 2023/24 season, when his contract expires," said a club statement.

Monday's announcement came amid media speculation that former Real Madrid, Wolves and Spain manager Julen Loptegui had agreed a deal to replace Moyes, in his second spell as West Ham manager, after the end of the current campaign.

Moyes said: "I have enjoyed four-and-a-half brilliant years at West Ham, and the club is in a stronger position than when I returned back in 2019.

"When I joined West Ham for a second time, the club was one place above the relegation zone, and it has been a terrific journey to have achieved three consecutive seasons in Europe."

The 61-year-old Scot, a former manager of Everton, added: "After leading the club (West Ham) to safety, we guided the team to finishes of sixth and seventh in the Premier League, and I was delighted when we won the Europa Conference League title last June – the club's first major trophy in 43 years.

"I would like to thank all the players for their support, and all the success they have achieved, over the last four-and-a-half years."

West Ham joint chairman David Sullivan told the club's website: "On behalf of everyone at West Ham United, I would like to offer our sincere thanks and gratitude to David for the contribution he has made to the football club during his time as manager.

"David has been responsible for a period of great progress and success in our history, and we are extremely grateful for all of his hard work, commitment and dedication to the role." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Donovan Mitchell and the Cleveland Cavaliers silenced the young guns of Orlando, beating the Magic 106-94 in game seven of their NBA playoffs first-round series Sunday to book a meeting with Eastern Conference top seeds Boston.

It was another magisterial performance from Mitchell, who scored 39 points two days after pouring in 50 in the Cavs' game six defeat.

This time he had plenty of scoring support from teammates as the Cavs erased an 18-point second-quarter deficit to clinch a series in which the home team won every game.

Caris LeVert scored 15 points off the bench and Max Strus scored 11 of his 13 points in the third quarter, when the Cavs out-scored the Magic 33-15 to take charge.

Evan Mobley scored 11 points with 16 rebounds and five blocked shots to help Cleveland withstand a 38-point performance from Paolo Banchero.

The Cavs, with starting center Jarrett Allen sidelined a third straight game with bruised ribs, moved on to the second round a year after a stinging first-round loss to the New York Knicks.

The Magic pushed their lead to as many as 18 points in the second quarter before the Cavs clawed back to cut the lead to single digits.

Banchero's layup in the closing seconds of the first half saw Orlando take a 10-point lead into the break, but momentum was on Cleveland's side and they overwhelmed the Magic in the third.

Mitchell, relentless in the paint, tied it at 64-64 with a floater and LeVert drained a pair of free throws to give the Cavs their first lead since the first quarter.

The Cavs pushed their advantage to 14 points in the final frame, fans chanting "We want the Celtics" as the final minutes ticked off. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[McLaren's Lando Norris won the first Formula One race of his career with a shock victory over world champion Max Verstappen in the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday.

Breathing life into an F1 season that risked becoming a one-man story again, Norris, in his 110th race for McLaren, beat Verstappen by over seven seconds with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finishing third.

Verstappen, who began on pole, had won four of the opening five races of the season and leads the world championship standings.

It looked like business as usual with the Dutchman, who had won the previous two Miami races, leading until lap 24 when he pitted and Norris's McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took over the lead.

Australian Piastri himself went into the pits four laps later, allowing Norris to grab the lead and the British driver never looked back.

Crucially, Norris was able to pit during a safety car on lap 30, earning him a valuable time advantage which he never relinquished.

The safety car came after Kevin Magnussen clipped Logan Sargeant, sending the American Williams driver into the wall, bringing a yellow flag.

Norris, who had 15 podiums before his first win, took full advantage of the safety car and with Verstappen struggling to catch up, he secured his maiden victory.

Norris was hoisted in the air by the McLaren mechanics as his long wait for a victory in the sport came to an end.

"About time huh?" said Norris, "I knew on Friday that we had the pace...today we managed to put it together. We had the perfect strategy, it all paid off," he added. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[New Zealand secured double glory at the Singapore Sevens on Sunday, winning both the men's and women's tournaments to signal their Olympic intent with the Paris Games fast approaching.

New Zealand's men held off a determined challenge from Ireland to win 17-14 while their women's team surged to a 31-21 victory over Australia.

New Zealand raced into an early 10-0 lead in the men's final with tries by Leroy Carter and Fehi Fineanganofo but Gavin Mullin narrowed the deficit for the Irish just before the interval.

Dylan Collier restored New Zealand's 10-point cushion in the second half but Harry McNulty's response set up a tense finale.

The All Blacks held on for their second series win in a row after their success at Hong Kong last month.

New Zealand forward Tone Ng Shiu said his team were building momentum for the sevens series grand final in Madrid and the Paris Olympics in July.

"We started off slow in the world series this year but now we're just building up to the Olympics, taking it one tournament at a time," he said.

"Two wins in a row -- you've got to be happy with that," added Ng Shiu, who was in the New Zealand side that took the silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics.

"We know there's a bit of pressure to get that gold medal.

"We tried two times and we weren't quite there. So hopefully we can embrace the pressure at the next tournament and build for the Olympics."

Argentina were crowned men's series winners after they recovered from a 10-point deficit to beat South Africa 14-10 in the fifth-place playoff.

The South Americans won tournaments earlier this season in Cape Town, Perth and Vancouver to top the table with 106 points, two points ahead of the second-placed Irish.

Great Britain bounced back from a heart-breaking 15-12 extra-time loss to Ireland in the semi-finals to trounce Australia 29-7 in the third-place match.

The result saw GB leapfrog the United States for eighth place in the league standings and secured their status as a core team in next season's world series.

"To be in that top eight in Madrid secures our programme's funding for another year," said GB captain Robbie Fergusson.

"That means the boys have jobs next year, it means we can have contracts. It means everything," said the Scot.

"Nobody gave us a hope-in-hell chance this weekend of pushing the USA out of the top eight and taking that spot.

"But we had total belief in our group and we did something special this weekend and hopefully we can kickstart a special few months now heading into the Olympics."

Argentina, Ireland and Great Britain will be joined in the grand final by New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, France and South Africa.

The United States, Spain, Samoa and Canada finished outside the top eight and will face four teams from the challenger series in a promotion-relegation event in Madrid to determine next season's core teams.

In the women's tournament, New Zealand clinched top spot in the standings after a hat-trick of tries by Michaela Blyde helped them to a convincing victory over Australia.

In a clash between the top two teams, the Black Ferns trailed 14-5 late in the first half but scored four tries to win their fourth straight tournament after victories in Vancouver, Los Angeles and Hong Kong.

France finished third in Singapore and in the standings after a 29-7 victory over Fiji. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[China completed a Thomas and Uber Cup double on Sunday as both men's and women's teams beat Indonesia to win their respective world team championship finals in Chengdu.

The men, who won 3-1, lifted China's first Thomas Cup since they beat Japan in 2018 – and their 11th in all.

But it meant agony again for 14-time winners Indonesia, who lost their second successive final after falling to India two years ago in Bangkok.

In the women's event, Indonesia had earlier been powerless to prevent a flawless China lifting the Uber Cup for a record-extending 16th time with a 3-0 victory.

The next most successful women's nation are Japan, who have won the Uber Cup six times.

He Bingjiao's 10-21, 21-15, 21-17 victory against Ester Nurumi Tri Wardoyo completed a perfect 24-0 tournament match record for China's women.

They regained the title they lost to South Korea two years ago in Thailand.

In the night session, world number two Shi Yuqi got China's men off to a fast start by destroying seventh-ranked Anthony Ginting 21-17, 21-6 in 43 hugely impressive minutes.

The pivotal moments came in the first doubles as Liang Weikeng and Wang Chang edged an epic to beat Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto 21-18, 17-21, 21-17 in a 64-minute thriller.

The Chinese pair fought back time and again after trailing 10-4 in the opening game, 6-3 in the second and 8-4 in the third in a gutsy display.

World number three Jonatan Christie gave Indonesia some hope when he beat sixth-ranked Li Shifeng 21-16, 15-21, 21-17 in 1hr 17min of see-saw action to extend the final.

But Indonesia's chances were snuffed out when He Jiting and Ren Xiangyu ran away with the second doubles 21-11, 21-15 in just 37 minutes to beat Muhammad Shohibul Fikri and Bagas Maulana and seal the trophy.

Earlier the outranked Indonesian women's slim chances had hinged on Gregoria Mariska Tunjung breaking through in the opening singles against Chen Yufei.

But Chen never allowed her opponent into the contest in a comprehensive 21-7, 21-16 win in just 38 minutes.

"I didn't feel that comfortable although I have played such matches before," said Chen.

"I still feel stressed, and maybe my opponent was. I always feel pressured in finals.

"I have lost to her before. What I did was watch a lot of matches that I'd lost to her. It's not going to help if I only watch matches that I won."

Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan did not give Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti and Ribka Sugiarto a sniff in a 39-minute doubles demolition.

"The scariest thing is when people think you should win," said Chen Qingchen.

"Things become different when you assume you can win. The only thing we need to do is prepare and be humble."

Their 21-11, 21-8 canter set up He for the Cup-winning victory in the second singles.

"During the last three years we experienced failures, and I'm happy that we could regain the title," said He. (AFP)]]>

    Liverpool crush Spurs, adding to Villa's misery

    <![CDATA[Liverpool shattered Tottenham's hopes of finishing in the Premier League's top four with a 4-2 win that left Aston Villa on the brink of Champions League qualification despite their 1-0 defeat at Brighton on Sunday.

Needing a win at Anfield to close the gap on fourth-placed Villa, Tottenham slumped to a fourth successive loss to leave their Champions League hopes in tatters.

Villa are seven points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham, who have a game in hand but will miss out on the top four if Unai Emery's men win one of their remaining two matches.

Mohamed Salah was back in the Liverpool team after being dropped for last weekend's draw at West Ham.

Jurgen Klopp, in the final weeks of his nine-year reign, was celebrating in the 16th minute when Salah notched his 25th goal in all competitions this term with a clinical header from Cody Gakpo's cross.

Andrew Robertson scored Liverpool's second on the stroke of half-time as the Scotland left-back finished from close-range after Salah's shot was saved by Guglielmo Vicario.

There was worse to come for woeful Tottenham as Gakpo headed in a 50th-minute cross from Harvey Elliott, who netted the fourth in the 59th minute with a superb curler from 20 yards.

It was little consolation for Tottenham that Richarlison reduced the deficit in the 72nd minute before setting up Son Heung-min's goal five minutes later.

A Villa win combined with a Tottenham loss would have sealed a Champions League place for Emery's side.

But Villa were unable to fulfil their part of that equation as Joao Pedro's 87th-minute goal condemned them to a second painful defeat in four days.

Ending Brighton's six-match winless run, Pedro headed in the rebound after Robin Olsen saved his penalty, which had been awarded for Ezri Konsa's foul on Simon Adingra.

At Stamford Bridge, seventh-placed Chelsea thrashed West Ham 5-0 to keep alive their hopes of European qualification. (AFP)

    Otaegui wins China Open from five shots back

    <![CDATA[Adrian Otaegui shot a superb seven-under-par 65 on Sunday to come from five shots back to win the Volvo China Open and a place in the US PGA Championship in two weeks.

The Spaniard finished on a 54-hole total of 198, 18-under par, to win the weather-shortened event at Hidden Grace Golf Club in Shenzhen after Saturday's play was cancelled because of dangerous storms.

It gave him victory by one stroke from Italy's Guido Migliozzi, who carded a final-round 67.

Second-round leader Sebastian Soderberg of Sweden, who started five clear of Otaegui, saw the title slip from his grasp with a sorry double-bogey at the 18th when a par would have taken him into a playoff.

He finished at 16-under par after a 72 alongside England's Paul Waring (69) and Switzerland's Joel Girrbach (67).

"I was starting five shots back so I just didn't look at the leaderboard, not think about the result. Just play my game," said Otaegui who won his fifth DP World (European) Tour title.

Otaegui's victory in the final event of the DP World Tour's Asian Swing secured a berth at the season's second major, the US PGA Championship at Valhalla, beginning on May 16.

"Well, that's very good news," said Otaegui when informed that he had finished third on the Asian Swing standings -- enough to get him into the next major.

"Playing some majors this year was a big goal for me," said the world number 143.

"Will just be enough time to rest a little bit at home next week and then head to America."]]>

    <![CDATA[Saul "Canelo" Alvarez retained his undisputed super-middleweight world title with a convincing unanimous decision over fellow Mexican Jaime Munguia on Saturday.

Alvarez handed Munguia the first defeat in 44 professional bouts, dropping the 27-year-old challenger in the fourth round and inexorably taking control to improve to 61-2-2 in his storied career.

The judges scored it 117-110, 116-111 and 115-112 for Alvarez, who retained his IBF, WBA, WBC and WBO belts.

Munguia, whose 34 knockouts included victories inside the distance in four of his previous five fights, came out on the attack against the vastly experienced Alvarez, pushing him back with his jab and rattling the champion in the third round with a right to the jaw.

But Alvarez responded in the fourth. After Munguia connected with a pair of solid rights Alvarez followed a left hook with a massive uppercut that sent Munguia to the canvas.

The fifth round opened to chants of "Canelo!" ringing in the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, where support was evenly divided between the Mexican combatants in a fight coinciding with Mexico's Cinco de Mayo festivities.

An Alvarez jab popped Munguia's head back and, in the sixth, an Alvarez left hook had Munguia's knees buckling briefly.

In a fight billed as a possible changing of the guard, Munguia -- who has honed his aggressive style under the tutelage of longtime Manny Pacquiao trainer Freddie Roach -- continued to press.

But his vaunted power rarely bothered Alvarez, who repeatedly found away past Munguia's guard to land the more damaging blows.

"You know, I take my time," Alvarez said of his measured start.

"I have a lot of experience. Jaime Munguia is a great fighter. He's strong. He's smart, but I take my time.

"I have 12 rounds to win the fight, and I did. I did really good and I feel proud about it," added Alvarez, who hasn't posted a knockout since he stopped Caleb Plant in the 11th round in 2021.

Alvarez said that after a few rounds he could see everything that was coming from Munguia.

"He's strong, but he's a little slow," Alvarez said. "I can see every punch." (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[It was a three-way thriller to the wire in the 150th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs.

Mystik Dan, ridden by Brian Hernandez, held on late to win a three-way photo finish by just a nose over Sierra Leone and Forever Young to capture the first leg of the Triple Crown on Saturday night in front of 156,710 fans.

"It's like a dream come true," Hernandez said.

Sent off at odds of 18-1, Mystik Dan made the turn for home in front and stayed on the rail with Forever Young just to his outside and Sierra Leone on the far outside.

There was a gasp from the crowd as the three colts hit the finish line. It took several minutes for the racing stewards to look at the finish line photo and declare Mystik Dan the winner.

It was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- which is the closest margin you can have in horse racing -- and it was the first nose decision since Grindstone edged out Cavonnier in the 1996 Derby. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Ireland remained in the hunt to win the world rugby sevens series title after they came from behind to beat series leaders Argentina 21-5 in the quarterfinals in Singapore on Saturday.

The South Americans could have been crowned regular season champions with a win at the National Stadium and they took the lead when Tobias Wade opened the scoring late in the first half.

But Ireland hit back through Jordan Conroy just before half-time and tries after the interval by Terry Kennedy and Billy Davis secured their victory.

Ireland have not finished higher than third in this season's series and would need to win the Singapore event while hoping Argentina lose to South Africa in the fifth-place play-off in order to clinch the series title.

However, Conroy was delighted with his side's performance in the must-win game.

"This was a very important game. It was the decider for who could possibly win the whole series, so we were really focused and worked hard and we got the result," said the 30-year-old.

"If we had lost, we would have been out of the title race. But now we've put ourselves in a really good position for tomorrow and we will get our teeth sunk in then."

Ireland's semi-final opponents on Sunday will be Great Britain who trounced France 35-7 in their quarterfinal.

The British were beaten 19-5 by Ireland in their opening pool game in Singapore but battled back to beat Fiji and the United States to secure their place in the last eight.

The other semi-final will feature Australia and New Zealand who came through a pair of hard-fought quarterfinals.

Australia squandered a 19-point lead against South Africa but came back to win 29-24 in extra time while New Zealand prevailed 19-14 against the United States.

The regular season winners of the sevens series will be decided in Singapore with the top eight teams going through to the grand final in Madrid later this month while the bottom four sides will compete in a promotion-relegation event to determine the core teams for next season's series.

In the women's tournament, series co-leaders New Zealand and Australia remained on course for a showdown in Sunday's final after they maintained their perfect records in Singapore.

New Zealand topped their pool with emphatic wins against Ireland, Canada and Spain before seeing off Great Britain 24-5 in the quarter-finals while Australia beat Fiji, Great Britain and Brazil in pool play and sealed their place in the last four with a 24-14 win over Ireland.

Fiji will face New Zealand in the semi-finals after edging Japan 12-10 while France will take on the Australians following a 24-0 trouncing of Canada. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Erling Haaland scored four times as Manchester City thrashed Wolves 5-1 to move within one point of Arsenal after the Premier League leaders beat Bournemouth 3-0 on Saturday.

City responded to Arsenal's victory just hours earlier with a goal blitz at the Etihad Stadium.

Pep Guardiola's side took the lead in the 12th minute when Rayan Ait-Nouri clattered into Josko Gvardiol, conceding a penalty that Haaland stroked past Jose Sa.

Haaland bagged City's second in the 35th minute as he rose highest at the far post to meet Rodri's cross with a majestic header that looped over Sa.

Deep into first half stoppage-time, Nelson Semedo tripped Haaland to give City another penalty that was drilled home by the Norway striker.

Hwang Hee-chan got one back for Wolves in the 53rd minute after a mistake by City keeper Ederson.

But Haaland curled a fine finish into the far corner in the 54th minute.

Julian Alvarez's 85th minute finish capped City's sixth consecutive league win, extending their unbeaten run in the competition to 20 games.

The reigning champions, who have a game in hand on Arsenal, will clinch an unprecedented fourth successive English title if they win their last three matches.

They head to Fulham next Saturday before visiting Tottenham on May 14 and hosting West Ham five days later.

At the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal cruised to a fourth successive victory, with Bukayo Saka's penalty putting them ahead on the stroke of half-time.

Leandro Trossard slotted past Bournemouth keeper Mark Travers in the 70th minute before Declan Rice capped a dominant display by blasting home in stoppage-time.

Chasing their first title since 2004, Arsenal's 26th Premier League victory this season equalled the club's top-flight record for a single campaign.

"It was probably the best first half we've played all season," Gunners boss Mikel Arteta said.

"We were unbelievable. Everything flowing, super composed on the ball. We generated so many chances, we could have gone three, four, five up easily."

Arsenal travel to Manchester United in their penultimate game next weekend before hosting Everton on May 19.

Burnley's hopes of avoiding relegation suffered a huge blow as Newcastle ran riot in a 4-1 win at Turf Moor.

Vincent Kompany's second bottom side are five points from safety, with only two games left to avoid an immediate return to the Championship after last season's promotion.

Callum Wilson put Newcastle ahead with a 19th minute tap-in and Sean Longstaff doubled their advantage in the 35th minute.

Bruno Guimaraes made it three in the 40th minute with a powerful strike before Arijanet Muric saved Alexander Isak's 50th minute penalty.

Isak made amends five minutes later when he grabbed his 20th league goal this season, making Dara O'Shea's 86th minute header no consolation for bedraggled Burnley.

At Bramall Lane, fourth bottom Nottingham Forest took a giant step towards survival with a 3-1 win against already-relegated Sheffield United.

Gonzalo Montiel brought down Ben Brereton Diaz and the Blades forward picked himself up to lash in the 17th minute penalty.

But Callum Hudson-Odoi grabbed Forest's equaliser in the 27th minute with a superb strike that curled into the far corner.

Ryan Yates slammed in Forest's second from close-range after 51 minutes and Hudson-Odoi curled home in the 65th minute.

That gave the Blades an unwanted record as the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season.

Forest, awaiting the result of their appeal against a four-point deduction for financial breaches, are three points ahead of third bottom Luton, who drew 1-1 with Everton on Friday.

West London rivals Brentford and Fulham shared a dour 0-0 draw. (AFP)

    Ipswich back in Premier League after 22 years

    <![CDATA[Ipswich returned to the Premier League for the first time in more than two decades after beating Huddersfield 2-0 to secure promotion from the Championship on Saturday.

Goals from Wes Burns and Omari Hutchinson ensured the Tractor Boys became just the fourth side in the Premier League era to go from the third to the top tier via consecutive promotions.

Leeds needed an Ipswich defeat coupled with victory over Southampton to leap into the top two.

But Daniel Farke's men lost 2-1 to Saints at Elland Road, meaning he will come up against old club Norwich in the playoff semi-finals.

Ipswich's most famous fan Ed Sheeran, who sponsors the club's shirts, was not in attendance for wild scenes of celebration at Portman Road as fans poured on to the pitch and lit blue flares at full-time.

The Suffolk club, which was sold to American investors for just 40 million pounds (HK$391.96 million), will now pocket at least 200 million pounds in television revenue in the coming years.

Ipswich's rise was masterminded by boss Kieran McKenna, who has earned rave reviews in his first managerial role.

McKenna failed to make the grade as a Tottenham player due to a hip injury.

But the 37-year-old thrived as a youth academy coach with Tottenham and then Manchester United.

He was promoted to help coach United's first-team by Jose Mourinho and retained that role under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick at Old Trafford before joining Ipswich in 2021.

"It means a lot, mostly seeing how much it means to everyone, the players, the supporters. To be one of the leaders of that is absolutely massive," McKenna said.

"It's a wonderful day, I'm very proud of everyone involved. It's what we've done all year. It's an incredible amount of effort." (AFP)]]>

    Canelo and Munguia make weight ahead of title bout

    <![CDATA[Undisputed super-middleweight world champion Saul "Canelo" Alvarez and unbeaten Jaime Munguia both made weight Friday for their world boxing title showdown in Las Vegas.

Alvarez, who will put his four super-middleweight belts on the line on Saturday, weighed in at 166.8 pounds (75.6kg) while fellow Mexican Munguia tipped the sales at 167.4 pounds.

The fighters greeted each other with respect on the stage in front of the T-Mobile Arena, where thousands of fans turned out to record the spectacle with their cell phones to the sound of mariachi music.

"I feel really good," Alvarez said. "I feel in my prime. I feel in my best, because I've got no injuries anymore, so I feel my best right now.

"I'll show you guys on Saturday night. I'm in my best shape -- ever."

The 33-year-old champion had surgery on his left hand in 2022 after suffering the second loss of his career, against Dmitry Bivol.

Since then,Alvarez has won three straight decisions but he hasn't added to his tally of knockouts and brings a record of 60-2-2 with 39 knockouts to the bout.

The fight marks Alvarez's first since 2017 against a Mexican opponent, who has drawn plenty of fans himself for the bout coinciding with the Cinco de Mayo holiday.

Munguia, who boasts a record of 43-0 with 34 knockouts, vowed to make the most of his opportunity.

"Tomorrow I'm going to be world champion," said the 27-year-old from Tijuana, who has honed an explosive style under the guidance of trainer Freddie Roach, long-time trainer of Filipino icon Manny Pacquiao.

Promoters have hyped the encounter as a potential changing of the boxing guard, with Munguia poised to dethrone an opponent who made his professional debut way back in 2005.

Unsurprisingly, Alvarez -- and oddsmakers -- see it differently.

"I don't care about experiences versus youth, I'm Canelo," Alvarez said this week, predicting a "decisive" victory in defence of his WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO world titles. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Los Angeles Lakers fired head coach Darvin Ham on Friday after two seasons and a 90-74 regular-season record.

"We greatly appreciate Darvin's efforts on behalf of the Lakers and recognize the many accomplishments achieved over the past two seasons including last year's remarkable run to the Western Conference finals," general manager Rob Pelinka said in a team-released statement.

"We all want to thank Darvin for his dedication and positivity. While this was a difficult decision to make, it is the best course of action following a full review of the season. This organisation will remain unwavering in its commitment to deliver championship-calibre basketball to Lakers fans around the world."

The Lakers finished the regular season with a 47-35 mark, good enough for only an eighth-place finish in the Western Conference. They defeated the New Orleans Pelicans in the play-in round to earn the No 7 seed in the playoffs but were bounced by the Denver Nuggets in the opening round, 4-1.

The Nuggets also defeated the Lakers last season in the conference finals on the way to their first NBA title.

All had seemed optimistic in Lakers land when the team roared to the title in the NBA in-season tournament with a 123-109 victory over the Indiana Pacers at Las Vegas on December 9.

But a 3-9 stretch followed, and reports emerged of growing unrest between the players and Ham, 50.

The Lakers hired Ham on June 3, 2022, to replace Frank Vogel following a 33-49 record in 2021-22, two years removed from winning the NBA championship. It was Ham's first NBA head coaching job.

Lakers fans chanted "Fire Darvin Ham" in Game 3 of the series with the Nuggets. After the game, All-Star Anthony Davis said the Lakers "don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor" for stretches of games. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Uefa have agreed to increase squad sizes from 23 to 26 players for the Euro 2024 tournament in Germany, European football's governing body said on Friday.

International managers had voiced concerns when a return to the pre-Covid-19 23-player limit had been confirmed by Uefa, after it was increased to 26 for Euro 2020 and World Cup 2022.

"The Uefa Executive Committee has today decided to increase the maximum squad size of the teams participating in the upcoming Uefa Euro 2024 from the original quota of 23 to 26 players," a Uefa statement said.

"The increase does not represent an obligation for the participating national associations."

Participating countries have until June 7 to provide Uefa with a squad list containing a minimum of 23 players and a maximum of 26. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Indiana Pacers powered into the second round of the NBA playoffs on Thursday, thrashing the depleted Milwaukee Bucks 120-98 to win their Eastern Conference series 4-2.

Unable to close out the Bucks on Tuesday, the Pacers got their uptempo offence flowing again, relentlessly pulling away after trailing by seven points in the opening minutes.

All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton delivered a double-double of 17 points and 10 assists, but it was reserve guard Obi Toppin leading the Pacers scoring with a career playoff high 21 points.

TJ McConnell added 20 points off the bench along with nine assists and four steals as the Pacers reserves contributed a whopping 50 points.

"I'm so proud of the perseverance," Haliburton said of Toppin and McConnell. "Obviously neither of them had a really good game last game -- none of us did. We just responded the right way."

Indiana led by 12 at halftime, and after the Bucks cut the deficit to seven on a Brook Lopez layup with 1:05 left in the third the Pacers authored an 11-0 scoring run and romped away in the final period.

Eight-time All-Star Damian Lillard returned from a two-game injury absence and led the Bucks with 28 points.

Lopez and Bobby Portis scored 20 points apiece, but with two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo still sidelined by the calf injury suffered late in the regular season the Bucks couldn't find an answer.

The Bucks, who won the title in 2021, lost in the first round for the second straight season after falling to Miami last year.

The Pacers hadn't won a playoff series since 2014, when they reached the Eastern Conference finals.

In the Eastern Conference semi-finals Indiana will take on either the second-seeded New York Knicks or the Philadelphia 76ers, who clashed later Thursday in Philadelphia with the Sixers trying to stave off elimination. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[Pinpoint headed goals from Trevoh Chalobah and Nicolas Jackson earned Chelsea a 2-0 victory over London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Thursday, dealing a blow to Spurs' hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League.

Former academy defender Chalobah diverted the ball expertly into the top corner from a Conor Gallagher free kick 35 metres out in the 24th minute.

It gave Chelsea a deserved lead after sustained pressure from the home side with chances for Mykhailo Mudryk, Marc Cucurella and Noni Madueke. Spurs defender Micky van de Ven kept his side in the match, with last-ditch tackles in the area and a clearance off the line.

Tottenham's Australian coach Ange Postecoglou looked furious in the dugout throughout the first 45 minutes and his side came out of the second half with greater verve and determination.

But efforts by Son Heung-min and Pedro Porro were blocked and saved.

Senegal's Jackson calmed home nerves against the run of play in the 72nd minute when he was on hand to head home after a free kick from Chelsea top scorer Cole Palmer hit the bar and bounced down.

The three points, taking them to eighth, were vital for the push by Chelsea, under former Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino, towards a Europa League place after a disappointing season but left Tottenham seven points adrift of the top four.

"We are in a good place," Pochettino said. "We have amazing professionals working on set-pieces. The team really showed in the way we wanted to build this way to play."

He described the first half as fantastic. "Then you have to contain and suffer."

Postecoglou took responsibility for the defeat.

"I feel like we've lost a bit of belief and conviction in our football and that is on me to change that," he said. "We were nowhere near good enough. That is on me."

Tottenham have a poor record against their southwest London rivals. They lost the home fixture last November 4-1 and have won only one of their last 10 meetings. (Reuters)]]>

    <![CDATA[Defending Madrid Open champion Aryna Sabalenka produced a brilliant comeback from a set and a break down to beat Elena Rybakina and reach the final on Thursday.

The Belarusian second seed triumphed 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 [7/5] and will face world number one Iga Swiatek on Saturday in a rematch of last year's final.

The clinical Swiatek earlier eased past American Madison Keys with a comfortable 6-1, 6-3 victory.

In the men's draw third seed Daniil Medvedev retired injured from his quarter-final clash with Jiri Lehecka.

Sabalenka, 25, sealed her victory with a typically powerful serve that Rybakina could not control.

The big-hitter had lost three of her last four clashes against the 24-year-old but emerged triumphant as they met on clay for the first time.

Swiatek has a 6-3 record against Sabalenka but in their only match in the Spanish capital, the latter triumphed in three sets a year ago to claim the title.

Dominant on clay, Swiatek barely put a foot wrong against Keys, making just eight unforced errors in the match to leave the 29-year-old American with virtually no chance.

Russia's Medvedev struggled through to the end of the first set against Lehecka with an apparent upper thigh problem, losing it 6-4 before retiring.

The Czech progressed to his first Masters 1000 semi-final, where he will face Felix Auger Aliassime, who received a walkover after top seed Jannik Sinner withdrew Wednesday with a hip problem.

Taylor Fritz will face Andrey Rublev in the other semi-final on Friday, after the Russian ousted home favourite Carlos Alcaraz on Wednesday. (AFP)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Boston Celtics crushed the Miami Heat 118-84 to complete an emphatic 4-1 series victory Wednesday and book their place in the second round of the NBA playoffs.

The postseason top seeds – upset by Miami in last year's Eastern Conference finals – avenged that loss in spectacular fashion with a one-sided wire-to-wire rout at the TD Garden.

Jaylen Brown and Derrick White scored 25 points apiece to lead Boston, who barely noticed the absence of the injured Kristaps Porzingis.

The Celtics threw down the gauntlet in the first quarter, racking up a whopping 41 points to open up a commanding 18-point advantage.

They extended that lead to 22 points by half-time, and kept up the pressure in the third quarter to lead 98-66 heading into the final frame.

Boston head coach Joe Mazzulla could afford to rest his frontline players for the fourth with the game effectively won against an injury-hit Miami team missing Jimmy Butler and Jaime Jaquez Jr.

Boston will now face either the fourth-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers or fifth seeds Orlando in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. Cleveland lead that series 3-2.

The Celtics advance into the next series brimming with confidence after ruthlessly taking care of eighth-seeded Miami in five games.

White's 25-point haul included five three-pointers while Jayson Tatum added 16 points including 12 rebounds with three assists.

Sam Hauser added 17 points off the bench while Jrue Holiday also cracked double figures with 10 points.

Bam Adebayo led Miami's scoring with 23 points, with Tyler Herro finishing with 15 and Caleb Martin 10. (AFP)]]>
