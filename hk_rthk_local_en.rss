    Works to build Hung Shui Kiu MTR Station begins

    <![CDATA[The MTR Corporation on Friday said preparatory work had begun for the construction of Hung Shui Kiu Station on the Tuen Ma Line.

The railway firm said construction of the new station, located between Siu Hong and Tin Shui Wai, was expected to be completed in 2030.

Walter Lam, MTR’s project manager overseeing the project, said this is the first time they are adding a station to an operating viaduct, on which the Tuen Ma Line runs.

“It’s about 10 to 11 metres above ground. We have a massive high-level working platform. And we don’t want to touch anything on top -- what I mean is the existing utilities, the existing overhead lines. We have to turn off the power,” he said.

Lam noted that one of the biggest challenges is they only have around six non-traffic hours a week to work at the site.

He said they had recently started removing a 400-metre segment of the parapet to make room for the new station. 

“Before we cut [the parapet], we have temporary support holding it in place, making sure it won’t move, it’s stable, and it’s safe. It won’t affect the operation on the next day,” he said.

The engineer said they would, at the next stage, build a foundation for the new station that is made of pre-cast components.

He said Hung Shui Kiu Station should open in 2030, when residents in the new development area are expected to move in.

The MTR said work was also starting this year to build new stations like Oyster Bay on the Tung Chung Line and Kwu Tung on the East Rail Line.]]>

    <![CDATA[Over 8,000 students of a private vocational college have been affected by a cyber attack, the privacy watchdog said on Friday. 

The Hong Kong College of Technology said its information technology network and file server were hacked in February. 

A ransomware group is believed to have got hold of 450GB of the college's data and the information was made public on the dark web on Tuesday. 

"This is not an ordinary attack, but a highly targeted and unusual cyber attack. The Hong Kong College of Technology condemns any cyber crimes and deeply apologises for any inconvenience and troubles caused by the incident," a spokesperson said. 

The college said it reported the breach to the police and the privacy commissioner's office, shut down the affected system, and launched a probe with the help of independent cyber security experts. 

It added that it will provide credit monitoring and dark web monitoring services to those affected for half a year at no cost. 

In response to media enquiries, the privacy commissioner's office said it was informed about the data breach on February 21.

The watchdog said about 8,100 students had been affected and information involved included names, identity card numbers, emails, telephone numbers and addresses. 

The Education Bureau urged the college to comprehensively investigate the incident and to take appropriate measures to strengthen network security to prevent further similar attacks. 

Police said they are investigating the matter but no arrests have been made so far.]]>

    <![CDATA[Senior government officials have lauded Southern District care teams for their dedication in serving the community, saying they urgently address the needs of citizens. 

Chief Secretary Eric Chan and Home and Youth Affairs Secretary Alice Mak attended a ceremony in Aberdeen on Friday to celebrate the teams' first year of operation. 

Chan singled out the response to a landslide in Shek O Road last September for particular praise.

He noted that care teams were promptly deployed to various locations to provide food and other items to those affected by the landslide by boat, and helped with temporary accommodation.

Mak, meanwhile, said the care teams have exceeded their performance targets, paying visits to 11,000 households and handling over 1,500 enquiries throughout the past year. 

The tasks they handled ranged from home repairs, to technology assistance and form-filling support, she said. 

Mak said the teams also organised more than 300 activities, including national education seminars, festive celebrations and policy promotion events in the community. 

She said care teams across Hong Kong visited 90,000 households last year, adding that a review of the scheme will be carried out next year.

“The first phase of the care team services last for two years and after two years we will definitely review the whole scheme and see how we can enhance and improve the scheme so that more residents can benefit and we can provide more district-based services to our residents,” she said.]]>

    950,000 targeted in new poverty alleviation framework

    <![CDATA[The government has identified around 950,000 elderly people, single-parent households and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation, in a bid to measure the city's poverty more effectively. 

Around 555,000 senior citizens, 213,000 single-parent families and 214,000 people living in subdivided flats are included. 
 
In a Legco paper, the Labour and Welfare Bureau said the move was based on the latest statistics of household characteristics, employment and income conditions.

Since 2013, the official measure of poverty has been defined as living in a household with a monthly income below 50 percent of the median.

But the bureau said the current measurement may lead to an "overestimation" of the poverty situation in Hong Kong.

"Since the 'poverty line' was formulated based on the concept of 'relative poverty', poor households will always exist under 'relative poverty' regardless of the effectiveness of the poverty alleviation work," the paper said. 

"This may create the wrong impression to the public that 'more people become poor despite more resources being put in'. These limitations will in the long run weaken the function of the 'poverty line' in monitoring the actual poverty situation."

The bureau added that officials will offer help to the three target groups through various poverty alleviation projects, and set key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the new poverty framework. 

Lawmakers are set to discuss the paper during a welfare services panel meeting next Monday.]]>

    Pre-registration for dental clinics not ideal: govt

    <![CDATA[Health officials have conceded that the pre-registration system for public dental clinics is not an ideal arrangement, saying a planned digital ticketing system will be a better alternative than late-night queues. 

On Friday, the government pledged to finish the development of an electronic system within this year and provide assistance to people who are not tech-savvy to secure a slot to see a dentist. 

The government earlier announced that from July, people will be allowed to sign up for next-day emergency treatment from 8pm, rather than from midnight. 

But some lawmakers on the public accounts committee complained that bringing forward the preliminary registration hours will not shorten queuing times. 

"Unfortunately, I want to emphasise again that if we cannot meet the demand for service, then there will be a need to have a disc allocation. And if you have to ask people to come and queue, then definitely they will all try to come as soon as possible, and there will be a waiting time for them," Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau told the legislators.

"We now try to put in place a better arrangement, so the preliminary registration will be changed to 8pm the night before. I want to emphasise that this is not the ideal arrangement. But we just want to reduce the waiting time for the elderly. So the solution will be electronic registration."

Lo added that it would be a "utopian thought" to have no queues at clinics, saying it would require a large number of medical staff providing services. 

It would also be a waste of the city's medical resources, he added.

Director of Health Ronald Lam, for his part, promised that an electronic system would be ready within this year, as authorities are hammering out details with the contractors.

He also told lawmakers that officials will assist those who are not tech-savvy in making registrations on the platform.

"During the vaccination drive for Covid, there were a number of service points set up to help elderly people who are not familiar with technology to make a booking. There are still a lot of service points running in the community," Lam said. 

"Once we have completed developing the platform, we will offer assistance to elderly people should they need it via these existing service points."]]>

    Parents key to student mental health: expert

    <![CDATA[A clinical psychologist warned on Friday that he's noted a link between students' mental health and their relationships with parents.

Amos Cheung, a newly-appointed member of the Advisory Committee on Mental Health, said the focus should be on how to improve parents' mental well-being and communication skills, so they can be good role models. 

Recent Education Bureau figures show that the number of primary and secondary school students diagnosed with mental illness has more than tripled in the past five years. 

Cheung said he'd noted from his own private practice that students' poor mental health was often related to conflict with family members, and many young people felt that "their conditions were not well understood by their parents ... and] parents have their own agendas to drive".

But he stressed that a variety of pressures were involved, including better identification of possible mental health issues.

"I believe that actually it's a multiple-factors problem. Well, first, [it] might be an indication that actually parents, teachers are now more sensitive to the mental health conditions of young people, so with improved and increased sensitivity, of course, there will be an increase of these diagnoses," Cheung said. 

"But, of course, at the same time, it might also mean that, well, the mental health conditions in general might be worsening among these students as well."

Cheung said students learned from adults around them. 

"Children and even adolescents, they are not fully developed and equipped in handling their emotions. Actually they learn from adults. So when the adults around them, if their mental health, if their mental well-being, if their emotional stability are actually already compromised or not established, then of course it will increase their chances of having some of the mental health issues, especially emotionally related," he said.
He said the focus should be on how to improve the mental well-being and the communication skills of parents. 

"Because parents are the major key players in all of these things. So that when parents are already good emotion facilitators and communicators, then of course, the mental well-being and the student's ability to actually handle their emotions, would, of course, improve," he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong has expressed strong dissatisfaction against remarks made by the US State Department regarding the banning of a protest song in the SAR, calling it a blatant interference in the city’s judicial proceedings. 

A spokesman with the office said in a statement that SAR officials had made the right and necessary move to ban people from using the song to incite others to separate Hong Kong from the rest of the country, or insult the national anthem.  

The statement noted that the SAR government and the High Court had fulfilled their constitutional responsibility to protect national security as well as the dignity of ‘March of the Volunteers’.

The spokesman advised certain politicians to respect the basic principles of international relations and stop interfering in Hong Kong as well as China’s internal affairs. 

The US State Department’s spokesperson, Matthew Miller, had earlier described the Court of Appeal’s temporary injunction order to ban ‘Glory to Hong Kong’ as “the latest blow” to the SAR’s international reputation.]]>

    <![CDATA[The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), Xia Baolong, said the central government will continue to support the SAR's development into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre.

Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, met Xia in Beijing on Thursday, to brief him on Hong Kong’s efforts in attracting strategic I&T enterprises and talent, as well as the city’s latest developments in areas like digital economy.
 
Xia said the SAR government's work deserves full recognition, and that Beijing will continue to support Hong Kong.

Sun, for his part, said the SAR administration will "live up to its mission" and continue strengthening I&T co-operation with different mainland cities.

Separately, Xia also met with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung, and expressed the need for Hong Kong to continue developing the tourism sector. 

Having experienced profound changes in both the internal and external environment, he said the city's travel industry needs to identify new ways to boost growth. 

The HKMAO chief added that the SAR should adopt the strategy of "tourism everywhere", and develop new routes and products to consolidate Hong Kong's reputation as the best travel destination.]]>

    Mixed views on revised employment agency rules

    <![CDATA[There’s been mixed reaction to the government’s revised code of practice for employment agencies that is in part drawn up to deter foreign domestic helpers from "job-hopping".

Under the rules, agencies cannot offer money to encourage helpers to terminate their contracts early. 

They also need to clearly brief jobseekers on immigration rules regarding changes of employer.

The chairwoman of the Hong Kong Employers of Overseas Domestic Helpers Association Betty Yung, welcomed the changes, saying it will be made very clear to workers that they should aim to complete their two-year contract. 

"I think this will at least help to give a very clear concept to all domestic helpers that they should complete the contract because they have signed two years, right?” she said. 

Yung added that the renewed guidelines will have a deterrent effect on agencies. 

She told RTHK that during the pandemic, some companies had encouraged helpers to switch jobs to boost income. 

"During the period when there were no planes, some agencies had to do their business. They had financial difficulties, so they tried to make business by encouraging some helpers to change jobs."

On the other hand, Sringatin, who chairs the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union, said the revised code of practice may discourage helpers from leaving a bad working environment.

"In this kind of situation, domestic workers are very vulnerable. They are reluctant to make a report because of language barriers," she explained.

"They have the right to switch jobs in Hong Kong, and that is not clear in the guidelines. [It should be clearly spelled out] what domestic workers need to do if they experience [bad] working conditions."

Sringatin said however that the revised code, which bars agencies from disclosing, posting or displaying publicly sensitive information about jobseekers, their families or former employers, will better safeguard their privacy.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) on Thursday said it issued a practical guide to foster greater acceptance of guide dogs and their users with visual impairments in society.

The EOC conducted interviews with four guide dog users in October last year, and it found that some interviewees experienced disrespectful acts, such as being rejected from entering some premises. 

Guide dog user Koonie Chan said many people had misunderstandings about guide dogs, and more education was needed. 

"They can't differentiate whether it's guide dog or a pet dog... I got really frustrated. I asked [the waiters], and they said 'You can’t come in because you got a dog'," she said.

The EOC said people were allowed to bring their guide dogs into places like restaurants, MTR trains and franchised buses, but there’s no legal protection to ensure guide dogs could enter premises like schools and workplaces. 

But the EOC's executive director Ferrick Chu said public awareness should be further enhanced, before making any moves to improve existing legislation.

"Because of low awareness, because of misunderstanding, the better way to do it is through public education... [Whether] it's necessary to write another piece of legislation to extend protection, I think it's up to the community and the legislature," he said.

There are currently more than 50 trained guide dogs in service in Hong Kong, and the EOC said some universities are looking into using robotic guide dogs to help people with visual impairments.]]>

    <![CDATA[The High Court on Thursday started hearing a bid to overturn the government's approval of an environmental study into plans to build public flats on part of the Hong Kong Golf Club course.

Senior Counsel Benjamin Yu, for the club, told the court that the Environmental Impact Assessment had a lot of deficiencies.

He argued that the government had said it would identify trees on the golf course that could be classified as old and valuable, but no such findings were included in the environmental report.

The barrister said this is "vital" to the whole judicial review.

Yu also said a public consultation exercise had not been carried out properly or fairly, since authorities had been allowed to submit additional information during the assessment, but people's responses to the submissions were not taken into account.

He said had the club had the opportunity to give further comments, it could have pointed out that an additional study was not comprehensive in assessing the development’s impact on the aquatic habitats at the site.

The lawyer noted that critically endangered Chinese Swamp Cypress trees on the golf course are sensitive to hydrological changes, and authorities should tread extra carefully when it is not known how the trees could be affected.

Judge Russell Coleman said the environment should be given “the benefit of the doubt” and should be protected in such situations.

Yu said the report also underrated the site's ecological value, by severely underestimating the different types of bats living there.

He said the report only mentioned one bat species, when a separate study carried out by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department found 17.

Yu added that the golf course, which is more than 100 years old, should be regarded as a site of cultural heritage, even though it is not a declared monument.

He said it is “odd” that the environmental review concluded that the immediate impact of building on the old golf course was “undetermined” when there would be direct changes and heritage would be destroyed.

The government took back 32 hectares of the golf course last year, with a plan to build public housing flats on nine hectares of the land.

The High Court last year suspended the environmental review on an interim basis so the site could be preserved pending this hearing which is set to continue on Friday.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Labour Department on Thursday ordered contractors linked to a fatal accident at the Kai Tak Sports Park to suspend the use of an elevating work platform. 

It said the construction worker, 52, was trapped between the platform and a metal structure as he was inspecting on Wednesday.

The department said officials immediately started an on-site investigation once they were notified about the accident, and issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned to suspend the use of the platform.

"The contractors cannot resume the work until the department is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," it said in a statement.

The department added it would complete a probe into the case as soon as possible, find out if any party was liable and take legal actions if necessary, while recommending improvement measures.

It said it was saddened by the death and expressed its deepest sympathy to his family.

The worker was found unconscious on Wednesday morning and was rushed to Kwong Wah Hospital, where he was later certified dead.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong will welcome thousands of civil aviation leaders next year to explore business possibilities and open new air routes to the SAR, as the city prepares to host a major global airline route convention for the first time in September 2025.

The event - Routes World 2025 - will be organised by the Airport Authority, in collaboration with Routes, which operates global airline and airport networking events and conferences, with a particular focus on world aviation routes.

Speaking at a signing ceremony to mark the collaboration, Steven Small, Director of Events at Routes, expects the event will attract attendees from 150 countries and 250 airlines who seek to expand their global airline route networks.

These, he noted, could bring significant economic benefits to the SAR.

“A typical Routes World event can exceed over US$590 million of economic impact over a three to five year period. That only can take place if it’s part of a strategic plan of growth, and Hong Kong is a fantastic example of that strategic plan,” he said.

“Its location, superb infrastructure, and exciting tourism offerings means that Hong Kong international airport is already recognised as one of the best international aviation hubs globally,” Small added.

Meanwhile, Vivian Cheung, chief operating officer of the Airport Authority, noted the timing of this event is very "ideal" as the city is expected to complete the third runway expansion project by the end of this year, which will enable the city’s airport to serve 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo per year.

“In addition, we are progressing at full speed with the development of what we call ‘the airport city’ to showcase attendees the city’s enormous business potential,” she added.

Airport city is an area under development that would eventually comprise entertainment, retail, and dining facilities, as well as convention and exhibition venues and hotels.

Cheung also noted the authority would take the opportunity to explore the potential for opening new long-haul flights, especially to countries involved in the nation's Belt and Road Initiative.

Prior to the event in 2025, the city will also host a major aviation event — the CAPA Airline Leader Summit, Asia & Sustainability Awards — in November this year.]]>

    'Waste charging should start in August at govt venues'

    <![CDATA[A green group has suggested that Hong Kong's much-delayed waste charging scheme should begin as planned on August 1, but only at government-run premises and facilities, other than public housing estates. 

The government earlier conceded that there are still problems with the pay-as-you-throw scheme, which has been tested at 14 locations since last month. 

In an open letter to Legco's environmental affairs panel on Thursday, the Green Earth said officials should start the first phase of the scheme in August, covering government offices, parks and public schools, among other venues.

"Participating government departments should propose clear waste reduction targets, cutting waste by 10 percent within 12 months, while disclosing the manpower expenditure and management costs of relevant premises to the public," it said. 

Edwin Lau, the group's founder and executive director, said the government should set an example and show the public how to reduce waste.

"The government can work out the most effective ways and the most eco-friendly ways to work on this waste charging - how to reduce waste, how to minimise the volume or weight of the waste - so that offices or residential blocks can reduce the volume of the waste, which is the main objective of the waste-charging scheme," he told RTHK.

He added that public education needs to be beefed up to clarify misunderstandings about the scheme.

"Many of the people do not really understand the reason why the government needs to enforce the waste charging law. They complained that waste recycling facilities are far away, not convenient, and they can hardly find a food waste collection facility to dispose of their food waste," he said.

"The government needs to step up public education and enhance the collection network to make it more convenient for the general public."]]>

    Revised helper agency rules target 'job-hopping'

    <![CDATA[The government on Thursday published a revised code of practice for employment agencies, partly to try to deter foreign domestic helpers (FDH) from "job-hopping".

The move comes after complaints about helpers switching employers within a short period of time during the pandemic.

Under the rules, agencies cannot offer money to encourage helpers to terminate their contracts early. 

They also need to clearly brief jobseekers on immigration regulations regarding changes of employer.

Officials said some of the changes will also better protect employers as consumers, such as requiring agencies to set out in agreements the fees for each service category.

"[They need to] clearly state whether a refund or arrangement for a replacement FDH will be provided where their services are not delivered in full, or the employment contract has been prematurely terminated by the FDH within the two-year contract period," the department said in a statement.

The revised code also bars agencies from disclosing, posting or displaying publicly sensitive information about jobseekers, their families or former employers.

The Labour Department said agencies will be at risk of losing their licence if they or their employees fail to follow the revised code.]]>

    <![CDATA[The head of the city's stock exchange operator on Thursday said average daily trading turnover was improving, paving the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) in the SAR. 

Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said trading volume towards the end of April had reached up to HK$150 billion, and that turnover during the Golden Week holiday period remained strong at over HK$110 billion when mainland markets were closed with reduced capital flows to the territory.

"The stock market's rebound means that we have regained the confidence of investors. This certainly helps more IPOs to get listed smoothly and successfully in Hong Kong," she told reporters. 

She said the number of IPO applications received by the bourse in the first quarter of this year was 30 percent more than in the same period in 2023, with around 100 currently waiting to be listed. 

Chan also noted that many firms had expressed interest after the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced new measures to facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms. 

Leading mainland companies would list in Hong Kong in the near future, which could boost the city's market, she added.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hospital Authority (HA) on Thursday said more than 7,000 medical professionals will gather at the Convention and Exhibition Centre for an annual conference next week.  

Around 160 speakers will share their views on telemedicine, smart hospitals and artificial intelligence during the HA Convention on May 16 and 17. 

Dr Loletta So, who chairs the convention’s scientific programme committee, said this year's edition will be the largest ever. 

“For the scale, it’s actually much larger than last year. I think it’s more than last year. And it’s actually the highest number of all the previous years. So it’s going to be a very big meeting for us,” she said. 

“We mainly focus on the core values of the HA, which is about the people-centred care, professional service, etc. Another main point is about the innovation in our healthcare. So we have something like artificial intelligence, and then we have the telehealth and smart initiatives." 

Eastern Hospital will also report on its latest developments regarding new innovation technologies, such as using artificial intelligence to detect strokes. 

Dr Samuel Lam, a neurosurgery consultant at the hospital, said the technology saves time for doctors because they don't have to go through image scans one by one. 

"It will help us to streamline the whole workflow. For example, when the AI software identifies those high-risk patients, then the intervention team will be alerted immediately in the fastest way," he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police on Thursday were investigating a fatal accident at Kai Tak Sports Park involving a construction worker. 

The man, 52, was found unconscious on Wednesday morning on a platform. He was rushed to Kwong Wah Hospital, where he was later certified dead.

Sports park officials said they have offered their condolences to the family of the man, who was an aerial work platform operator. 

They added that the contractor and sub-contractor involved will provide all the help they can to the family and will cooperate with police and Labour Department investigations. 

The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said it was the second fatal accident in less than three months involving the same contractor.

It said the firm should thoroughly review its safety management system in order to protect the lives of its workers.]]>
