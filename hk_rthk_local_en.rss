    Clear Water Bay Road reopens after repair work

    <![CDATA[The Transport Department said early on Monday that Clear Water Bay Road was back to normal, after being disrupted by a landslide. 

A slope measuring 30 metres long and 40 metres deep collapsed, and part of the pavement also caved in.

The slip forced officials to implement an arrangement in which two-way traffic shared the same lane near Wing Lung Road in Hang Hau. 

Transport minister Lam Sai-hung said earlier that Clear Water Bay Road should be open again by rush hour on Monday morning, after workers carried out remedial work.

Lam said workers were spraying concrete onto the slope, and more work would be carried out later to further consolidate the structure. 

"When we open the road, we have to ensure it's safe after the temporary consolidation work. If we can't do that, we won't open the road," Lam told reporters.

"At the same time, we'll have measures in place. Our contractor and the Highways Department will keep monitoring the situation here. We'll also liaise with the observatory to see if the weather will worsen, and we've installed some sump pumps in case there's heavy rain."

Authorities received 14 other landslide reports on Saturday, when the amber and red rainstorm warning signals were in effect for most of the day.

    People attempt bun tower climbing in Cheung Chau

    <![CDATA[A climbing carnival took place at Cheung Chau on Sunday, ahead of the island's traditional bun-scrambling competition on Buddha's Birthday. 

The 14-metre-high bun tower frame is already in place for the competition on May 15, and carnival-goers were given the chance to see whether they could climb it. 

Ms Chung said her son had managed the feat. 

"We've tried bun scrambling over the years. When my son was young, he couldn't reach the top. Last time we came, he was able to get there at a slow pace with the help of his dad. But this time, he was able to do it all by himself very quickly," she said. 

"I was so happy to see him achieve that because yesterday it was raining really hard so I thought there wouldn't be a chance. Luckily the weather is beautiful. It's a lot of fun."

Ms Chung's 13-year-old son has now climbed the tower at least four times. He gave his advice on the best way to approach the climb.

"There isn't a specific technique to climbing. You just have to grasp the bamboo tightly and watch your footing. I love experiencing Hong Kong culture. I want to preserve and pass on Hong Kong culture like bun scrambling so more people know about it," he said. 

"I personally love eating lucky buns and watching bun scrambling on television, so I really wanted to see if it is actually that exhilarating in person, and see if it's really that easy or difficult."

Another visitor, Ms Lok, said she brought her friends from overseas to the carnival, so they could experience a bit of Hong Kong culture.

"We were shaking while climbing because the gaps are so small, but we had a lot of fun. Huge respect to those who can climb up so quickly. I think this is a great tradition to preserve, and I love the meaning behind it," she said. 

"We can pass peace to anyone, even if you aren't Chinese. My friends wanted to experience something quite traditional and this definitely checks the box."

Meanwhile, workers have been working hard to reconstruct the three traditional giant bun towers for display ahead of next week's festivities, after Saturday's heavy winds caused the bamboo scaffolding to collapse. 

Yung Chi-ming, chairman of the Hong Kong Cheung Chau Bun Festival Committee, said it would take one to two days to complete, but progress was going well. 

"We have never experienced the collapse of the bun tower scaffolding before. It was because the heavy winds hit it down. It is quite a rare incident. The latest situation is quite ideal. We thought it would take three to four days, but they've sent more people to help so the speed has increased significantly," he said. 

"I arrived at eight in the morning and everything has already been dismantled, and ready for reconstruction. I think everything can be restored in one to two days. I believe it will be reinforced this time around."

Yung also said the incident had incurred a cost, but he had not yet calculated how much money was involved. He added it was most important the Bun Festival runs smoothly next week.]]>

    <![CDATA[The government's top IT office on Sunday said it was asking all bureaus and departments to comprehensively review their data security measures, and reply within a week.

This came after reports of two data leaks in the past few days, involving the Companies Registry and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD).

The registry said on Friday the data of some 110,000 people had been exposed due to a fault in its digital platform.

The day before, the EMSD apologised over the data leak of some 17,000 public housing residents who had to undergo mandatory Covid tests in 2022.

Addressing the issue on social media, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer said it's highly concerned about the incidents.

It said it had again sent clear directives to the heads of bureaus and departments about the reviews.

"We also reminded all users and systems under the departments that they must stringently comply with the government's rules, policies and guidelines on data security in handling sensitive and personal information," it said in the post.

The office added this includes never storing data on publicly-owned cloud platforms.]]>

    <![CDATA[Welfare minister Chris Sun said officials don't plan to change the eligible age and coverage of the HK$2 transport subsidy. 

The government plans to complete a review of the scheme by the end of 2024, as its bill is expected to increase by 50 percent, to more than HK$6 billion this financial year. 

Sun said while there's a need to make changes to the scheme to ensure it is more financially viable in the long run, officials would keep several aspects of this "good policy" unchanged.

"The overriding principle is that the original intention of the scheme doesn't change - those benefiting from the scheme, that is elderly people aged 60 and above and the disabled, this won't change," the minister said on a TVB programme.

He added the government did not plan to ban the more expensive bus and minibus trips to the border, saying beneficiaries have gotten used to the travel convenience.

Sun said officials would try their best not to make it troublesome for the beneficiaries, or affect their willingness to travel.

The minister also stressed that officials would do more to tackle abuses by those who are not eligible for the scheme, and do more promotion to encourage beneficiaries to take cheaper rides whenever possible.]]>

    Golden Week tourists to boost city by HK$2 billion

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said the total number of mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong should reach the estimated 800,000 mark with the Golden Week holiday wrapping up on Sunday, adding it would boost the economy by over HK$2 billion. 

Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, Yeung said approximately 670,000 mainland tourists had already come to the territory in the first four days despite the rainy weather.

"The entire Guangdong Province was affected by the unstable weather, and tourists can see that the weather is also not that good in Hong Kong, so they may postpone their trip. However, the overall numbers aren't bad," he said. 

"I believe that we will reach our estimated number of tourists. If we have around 800,000 mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong, I think we can earn over two billion dollars in consumption. Even though we have only reached about 700,000 people so far, we should still reach over two billion dollars."

Responding to the mixed reviews of the Labour Day pyrotechnic display, Yeung said it was no surprise that people had expectations for the fireworks show, but the weather was unpredictable in how it would affect the viewing experience. 

"Rain is hard to predict, unlike wind which comes when it comes. Even if you see rain clouds, you don't know if it will actually rain. So up until 4pm of that day, we then decided it was appropriate to host the show," he said.

"I was watching from the top of a bridge where the wind was hitting so from the start of the fireworks, the smoke did reach me. However, from other viewing angles, people have sent me clear and beautiful photos of the show." 

He added they would learn from this experience and do better in terms of publicity and expectation management in the future.]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said Hong Kong's economy was maintaining its momentum.

Writing on his official blog, Chan said the city’s GDP had increased five quarters in a row, with growth going up 2.7 percent year-on-year in the quarter ending in March. 

Market sentiment had also improved, he said, with the Hang Seng Index gaining almost 14 percent recently after going up for nine consecutive days, while the property market had become more active after measures to curb speculation were lifted.

Chan said inbound tourism was one of the key drivers of the economy in the first quarter, adding the number of arrivals during the first three days of Golden Week, which stood at nearly 650,000, was up 25 percent from last year.

But the minister said external uncertainties remained, and that higher interest rates and a strong Hong Kong dollar would affect the city's tourism sector, as well as export and investment sentiment.

He called on companies to develop new products to explore new ways to manage their businesses, noting that authorities were helping SMEs to go digital.

The finance chief, who was attending the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, said many participants were interested in the development of the digital economy as well as the innovation and technology sector in the SAR.

Chan added authorities recently published the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, to provide a clearer definition of green products and help the sector reduce "greenwashing" risks.]]>

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak on Saturday said 12 care teams have been deployed to Sai Kung in response to the severe rainfall that hit the area.  

At one point, the Observatory recorded over 200 millimetres of rain in the district, causing significant flooding on several roads, including Po Lam Road North and Wan Po Road in Tseung Kwan O, as well as Pak Sha Wan Street in Sai Kung. 

The home affairs minister said some care team members were already on duty in temporary shelters while others were checking the district for floods and reporting to the Sai Kung district officer. 

She also dismissed claims that some care team members didn't turn up when the rain was at its hardest on Saturday morning.

“Care team members are volunteers and they are fully dedicated to their work. However, during periods of heavy rainfall and when there are floods, the responsibility for addressing standing water and flooding falls to the government's professional departments,” she said. “I think the general public don’t expect care teams to deal with the floods without the necessary equipment.”

She added that most floods in the district had been dealt with before noon and most roads affected had been reopened by 2 pm. 

She said the Home Affairs Department had opened nine temporary shelters across Hong Kong for people in need of temporary accommodation.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled the amber rainstorm warning signal at 8.45pm on Saturday. 

It said heavy rain over Hong Kong had started to ease. The Observatory had issued the amber signal to replace the red rainstorm warning just before 4pm.

However, the forecaster has also warned that another intense band of thundery showers is edging towards the Pearl River Estuary, and this might still affect Hong Kong. 

The red signal had been in place since about 9 am and, at around noon, the Observatory warned it might issue its maximum black signal as even heavier rain started to fall across Hong Kong, especially in the east. 

Meanwhile, the Drainage Services Department said it mobilised about 70 emergency response teams to handle flooding, involving over 160 emergency response teams comprising about 600 people. It said that by 7.30pm, all 16 flooding cases, including 12 in the Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O areas, had been resolved. 

The Geotechnical Engineering Office said it received 15 reports of landslides in the Sai Kung area. 

The Fire Services Department said that as of 7pm it had handled 25 reports of people trapped in lifts, and 71 reports from automatic fire alarm systems. It said fourteen people were evacuated.

The government said it received 22 reports of fallen trees with no injuries as of 8pm.

The Home Affairs Department said it had opened nine temporary shelters located in Southern District on Hong Kong Island, Yau Tsim Mong and Kowloon City in Kowloon, and Tseung Kwan O and Sai Kung in the New Territories.

    <![CDATA[Police on Saturday rescued two groups of hikers near Sai Kung, as heavy rain fell over Hong Kong, particularly in the east.

Officers said a group of 11 mainland tourists, including seven children, contacted police at about 11.30 am, after finding themselves stranded at High Island Reservoir East Dam. They had previously been camping in the area. 

At about the same time, rescuers were also called in by four local hikers who found themselves in difficulty on section two of the MacLehose Trail. 

The force said they were able to locate all of the stranded hikers, and evacuate them, adding that none of the 15 were injured and that they didn't require hospital treatment.

The Observatory issued the first Red Rainstorm Signal of the year just before 9 am, before saying it was considering issuing the higher Black Rainstorm Signal at around noon.

At 10.30 am, the forecaster also issued a Landslip Warning, reminding people to stay away from steep slopes, and to stay at home.]]>

    <![CDATA[Dozens of cars were damaged by flood water at a car park in Tseung Kwan O on Saturday, as heavy rain continued to fall over Hong Kong, leading the Observatory to consider issuing a Black Rainstorm Warning.

“For that particular outdoor car park area, there are around 450 cars. I think half of the cars were seriously [flooded]," said district councillor Christine Fong in an interview with RTHK. "Some of them, the water was up over the tyres, even up to the engine."

Fong also said the car park, on Wan Po Road in Lohas Park, didn't have a reputation for flooding so many drivers had been caught out. 

The Observatory said the east of the SAR had borne the brunt of the rainfall with over 200 millimetres of rain falling in Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O.

Road flooding in those two areas also meant that only limited services could be provided at two out-patient clinics there.

Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Department says it has opened temporary shelters for people in need of temporary accommodation.

Earlier, the Observatory had issued the Red Rainstorm Signal just before 9 am following a night of rain, leading to the suspension of classes at all schools.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Saturday said the new minimum wage formula will provide support to Hong Kong's 17,000 low income workers, who currently earn an hourly rate of HK$40.

The new formula - which bars any reduction - takes effect next year, after being given the go-ahead on Tuesday by the Chief Executive, John Lee, and the Executive Council.

Speaking to reporters after appearing on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun said the reform balanced the interests of both labour and employers.

"It has taken into account, on the one hand, the need to protect those earning a minimum wage, that their wage is being protected; and also, at the same time, to ensure that the formula is affordable, and also acceptable to the business sector," Sun said.

Earlier the labour minister told an RTHK radio programme that the government would enhance safety awareness following the deaths of two sewer maintenance workers, who are believed to have been exposed to toxic gas in a manhole last week in Sha Tin. 

Sun stated that new guidelines for those working in confined spaces, to be announced this month, will make it mandatory to install CCTV at the entrance and exit of manholes.]]>

    <![CDATA[Catering sector representative Simon Wong on Saturday said restaurants saw 10 percent less business than usual this May 1 public holiday, which was also the first day of the mainland's Golden Week break. 

Speaking to reporters after appearing on a radio programme, the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades president said this was partially due to 20,000 fewer mainland arrivals on that day, although the May 1 firework display had helped trade near Victoria Harbour.

“We see that business in some areas in Hong Kong - like in Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, and along the harbour - because of the fireworks, recorded some increase," he said. "I did visit several districts in Hong Kong and saw that there were not too many people visiting shopping malls.”

Wong added that reduced spending power among individual travellers and the bad weather during the week contributed to the lower sales. He also attributed the lower sales to many locals heading north.

Meanwhile, a hotel group says the occupancy rate for its two hotels also dropped about six to seven percent when compared to last year.

Alan Chan, the operations officer of Miramar Group, said the group had offered substantial price discounts to retain hotel guests, with prices per night decreasing by approximately 23 percent year-on-year.

“For the hotel industry, if we need to drop prices by 23 percent to retain a certain occupancy rate, I think it’s not really ideal,” he said

He said that this year, many mainland flights had resumed to other countries, and visa requirements had also been relaxed for mainlanders, giving them more travel options.

Chan urged the government to liaise with mainland authorities to further expand the Individual Visit Scheme so more mainlanders could visit the SAR.

The five-day mainland holiday will conclude on Sunday.

According to the Immigration Department, arrivals on May 1 reached 460,000, with over 180,000 coming from the mainland.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Observatory on Saturday said it may issue the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, as heavy rain continues to batter Hong Kong, particularly in the east of the territory. It had issued the Red Rainstorm Signal just before 9 am, as the rainy weather that has hit Hong Kong over the past few days worsened. 

Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O have seen very heavy rain with the Observatory saying more than 200 millimetres have been recorded and that severe rainstorms would continue to affect the eastern part of the SAR. It also warned people to stay away from watercourses across the territory due to the possibility of flash floods.

Meanwhile, a Hospital Authority spokesman for the Kowloon East Cluster said road flooding meant only limited services could be provided at the Mona Fong General Out-patient Clinic in Sai Kung and the Tseung Kwan O Jockey Club General Out-patient Clinic.

Earlier, the government had called on the public to report flooding to the Drainage Services Department following wet weather overnight. There have been reports of flooding and a fallen tree in Chai Wan, and flooding on Silver Cape Road in Tseung Kwan O.

Schools have also been told to make sure conditions are safe before allowing students to leave, while all classes have been suspended for the afternoon

The government has also told employers to make arrangements for staff.

    <![CDATA[The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, says that the government is taking steps to enhance Hong Kong's attractiveness as a wealth management and capital formation centre in order to consolidate the city's position as a leading global financial centre. 

In an interview on RTHK's Your Home Address programme, he noted that one of the key measures introduced was the Capital Entrant Admission Scheme, which allows individuals with capital of more than HK$30 million to become permanent residents after residing in in Hong Kong for seven years. This scheme has received a positive response, he said. 

He discussed efforts to facilitate capital formation, including the reduction of stamp duty for the stock market and the reform of the Growth Enterprise Board, which focuses mainly on small and medium-sized enterprises.

"Hong Kong has a very competitive edge as the equity and also bond raising platform for different corporates. So in that context, we have a number of measures laid out and actually implemented phase by phase to enhance the appeal of our capital market," he said. 

Hui stressed that amid global geopolitical changes, people are looking for ways to diversify their assets, adding that Hong Kong can seize the opportunities arising from these challenges. 

He said the city is a very attractive option for individuals to invest their capital and channel investments through Hong Kong to the mainland. 

He said the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a wealth management and capital formation centre was evident with more than 2,700 single-family offices already established in the city.]]>

    HA sponsors new round of overseas podiatry training

    <![CDATA[The Hospital Authority (HA) is launching a new round of its overseas training sponsorship programme, fully subsidising eligible participants to earn a bachelor's degree in podiatry at the University of Northampton in the UK.

The scheme to send people abroad for training on foot treatment was first introduced in 2005 due to the lack of recognised programmes among local tertiary institutions.

Stanley Wan, who works as a resident podiatrist at Yan Chai Hospital, participated in the programme in 2014 and joined the HA in 2017. 

He had graduated with an engineering degree, but decided to switch to a new career. 

“In terms of my profile, I think I'm not really as good as other competitors, which could possibly already have a degree related to chemistry or bio-engineering,” he said.

“But I think I showed the interviewer that I have great determination of preparing myself. I applied for the course of physiology, trying to learn something that I probably [did not] know before. 

"Also I participated in my church activities, which mainly serve the elderly.”

Two or three places are on offer each year, and successful applicants must commit to working for the HA for at least five years upon graduation.

Priscilla Poon, the HA's chief manager of allied health, said applicants actually find the requirement attractive because Hong Kong doesn't have its own podiatry registration process.

“I think it's a kind of encouragement to them… For those graduates who have graduated in the UK – despite the fact that they are able to register in the UK – [but because] there’s no registration in Hong Kong, there won't be any guarantee of job opportunities,” she said.

“But if we ask them to serve in HA at least for five years, I think that will be a very positive message for them… they're still able to get a very good pay and a very good job opportunity in HA.” 

Poon said the HA currently employs 54 podiatrists, but lost about 5 percent of staff each year in recent years due to retirement or resignations.

She added that while the current staff level is sufficient, Hong Kong's ageing population is expected to increase the demand for podiatrists further.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Companies Registry on Friday said the personal information of around 110,000 people had been leaked due to a fault in its digital platform.

The registry said if people conduct searches on its e-Services Portal and pressed the F12 key, they might see additional personal details.

Information being exposed included names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, as well as full identity and passport numbers.

The body said urgent maintenance has been carried out to prevent further leaks, and that it is getting in touch with and apologising to those affected.

It added that it is consulting the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer with a view to conducting a comprehensive review of the incident and taking further enhancement measures to safeguard personal data.

The privacy watchdog, for its part, said it is launching a probe given the number of people affected in the incident.

Earlier, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department apologised after information of around 17,000 public housing tenants required to undergo Covid tests in 2022 was exposed online.]]>
