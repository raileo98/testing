    <![CDATA[The Customs and Excise Department on Wednesday said it seized a large batch of suspected smuggled electronic components, goods and waste on April 4, with a total estimated market value of about HK$100 million.

Customs officers arrested a 53-year-old female suspect the following day.

The Customs Department said on April 4, officers detected a suspected case of using an ocean-going vessel to smuggle goods to Malaysia at the Kwai Chung Container Terminals.

Customs officers then mounted an operation and seized a large batch of suspected smuggled goods, including integrated circuits, computer servers, routers, together with a batch of electronic waste, inside a container which was declared as containing aluminum alloy aboard the vessel.

 An investigation was ongoing. 

The arrested woman was released on bail pending further investigation and the likelihood of further arrests was not ruled out.]]>

    Govt changing fire safety priorities after Jordan fire

    <![CDATA[Development minister Bernadette Linn said officials were redeploying resources and reviewing priorities with regards to enforcing fire safety laws, following last week’s deadly blaze in Jordan that killed five people. 

She told lawmakers on Wednesday that more manpower would be deployed to step up prosecution, with a focus on buildings such as those with many guesthouses and subdivided flats as well as those with only one staircase. 

High risk blocks whose owners have not complied with mandatory building inspection orders, she said, would also be given priority. 

Linn conceded that the fire, as well as a number of fallen concrete and large-scale illegal structure cases last year, showed government efforts on ensuring building safety were not good enough.

"The incidents... reflect that owners have not taken government directives seriously, and that the government's enforcement efforts have fallen short," she said at a special Legco finance committee meeting on this year's budget.

The minister said the administration had to "vigorously enhance the effectiveness of law enforcement" to urge homeowners fulfill their responsibilities, while helping owners who need assistance in this regard.

Linn said officials were looking at submitting proposals to amend existing laws this year, which would include changes to streamline prosecution procedures and increase penalties.

Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien agreed it's time to add tougher penalties, noting that no one has been jailed for not complying with mandatory building inspection orders. Owners of Wah Fung Building in Jordan, he added, had ignored such orders for six years.

Linn said in the past three years, owners convicted of failing to comply with mandatory inspection orders have been fined an average of HK$2,500, with the highest penalty a HK$33,000 fine.

She said while there was a need for tougher penalties, the degree of severity would depend on the seriousness of each case and a balance needs to be struck.

The minister believed illegal structures and not improving fire safety facilities would be among the more serious cases prosecuted in future.]]>

    <![CDATA[A 31-year old man was on Wednesday jailed for six months for sneaking into toilets at Good Hope School and taking photos. 

Cheung Chun-hong, a former senior operations officer at Citybus, earlier pleaded guilty to three counts of voyeurism.

Kowloon City Court heard that Cheung dressed in the uniform of the girls' school and put on make up before sneaking into a toilet there. He was caught by two pupils.

Cheung was found to have planted a camera in the toilet.

He was arrested at an industrial unit in San Po Kong, where police found girls' uniforms, underwear and cosmetics.  

In mitigation, the defendant's lawyer said Cheung was a first-time offender, was remorseful, and was determined to seek professional help to address his issue.

But in sentencing, magistrate Ko Wai-hung said that while cross-dressing is a personal preference, it was intolerable that Cheung had used it to commit crime and satisfy his sexual desires. 

Ko added that the court had to show society's aversion to such offences, as well as protect the privacy of underage students.]]>

    Lawmakers upset over HK's food waste recycling rate

    <![CDATA[Lawmakers have criticised the government over its promotion of food waste recycling, with legislator Tony Tse saying the recycling rate of around five percent was "not good enough".

Discussing the latest government figures at a special Legislative Council Finance Committee meeting on Wednesday, Tse noted that food waste reached 3,300 tonnes a day in 2022, making up a third of the rubbish in the SAR's landfills.

In response, the Director of Environmental Protection, Samuel Chui, said while the food waste recycling rate still hovered at around five percent, officials have been doing more.

He said smart recycling bins have already been placed at some 70 percent of public housing estates, serving 1.5 million residents - and more can be expected soon.

"We are progressively increasing the number of food waste processing facilities in public housing estates," he told lawmakers.

"This August, all public housing estates will be equipped with a smart food waste processing bin that covers over 30 percent of the citizens in Hong Kong."

For private buildings, Chui said they could apply for government funding to install the bins and officials would try their best to help.

While there have been complaints the bins were often full or malfunctioning, Chui stressed that from official data, the bins worked around 99 percent of the time.

During the short periods when they were out of action, he said the machines were either full, or there were signalling issues.

The director reiterated that when the food waste recycling bins were around 70 percent full, management firms or cleaners would be notified to unload them.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hongkongers queued up at cinemas and major movie ticket sites crashed around midday as tickets for "Cinema Day" went on sale on Wednesday.

On Sunday, moviegoers can get discount tickets for just HK$30 as part of the "Happy Hong Kong" campaign to boost consumption and promote tourism. 

At one point, nearly 20,000 people were queuing up on the Broadway Circuit website, while the MCL Cinemas website said the wait could be more than one hour.  

At a cinema in Kowloon Tong, university student Gloria hoped to see more of these promotions in future. 
 
"Because it's really cheap. It's like 50 [percent] discount and I think it's a good time to relax before exams. I think it's good to have more discounts like this because it will attract more customers to buy movie tickets," she said. 

Mrs Li told RTHK the movie discount was a chance to spend more time with her loved ones. 

"It's good. It's cheap and I just want to spend time with my family together. I bought two [tickets] and I will take my kid under three years old [to the movies]," she said. 

However, some people told RTHK the discount was not really attractive due to the limited options at cinemas and the popularity of online streaming services.]]>

    Green groups call for veto of San Tin project EIA

    <![CDATA[Ten green groups on Wednesday made a final appeal to an advisory council to veto an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for a project which aims to build a new technology hub in the northern part of Hong Kong, arguing it is the worst wetland assessment since EIA regulations came into place in 1998. 

The Advisory Council on the Environment is due to discuss the EIA for the San Tin Technopole project next Monday. Afterwards, it will submit its suggestions to the Environmental Protection Department (EPD). 

Among the 10 environmental groups involved in the campaign is the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society. 

Wong Suet-mei, the group’s senior conservation officer, said green groups have compared this EIA to similar ones conducted in the past two decades and feel this one was lacking. 

“In terms of different items, including the ecological baseline survey, and preparations of the mitigation plan and the information that are published to the public, not only [did the EIA] not do enough, but they even missed some of the items,” she said. 

“For example, they missed two species of breeding birds and also they did not share the actual number of black-faced spoonbills that they counted in their survey.”

Wong said the EIA violated at least 35 statutory requirements and omitted at least 27 crucial data points. 

She said the EIA also missed out on a comprehensive wetland management plan to prove that compensating measures were in place to recover the wetland loss. 

She mentioned in the past, the government would resubmit the assessment in the event of significant re-planning or changes in the development area. 

The proposed development would affect about 247 hectares of wetland in the area.]]>

    <![CDATA[A social sciences professor has urged the government to provide volunteering opportunities and peer support for elderly people, to alleviate feelings of loneliness and enhance well-being. 

Chou Kee-lee, from the Education University, and other experts carried out a study during the pandemic in which people from their 50s to their 70s who reported feeling lonely were recruited to provide volunteer phone check-in services for a group of low-income people aged 65 and above. 

The researchers said that both groups of people later reported feeling reduced levels of loneliness. 

"Volunteering has a very high potential to deliver effective psychological interventions like mindfulness and behavioural activation. We think those interventions could [build] skills and [are] cost-effective," Chou said. 

He added that 30 to 40 percent of elderly people experience loneliness.

"The harmful effects of loneliness are comparable to smoking cigarettes and that would be linked to longer hospital stays and earlier residential stays among older adults, so it would definitely increase the healthcare costs in Hong Kong in the long run," he said.

Chou also said that community centres help elderly people socialise, but some find the facilities difficult to get to and home-friendly services similar to the phone check-ins would also be beneficial.]]>

    <![CDATA[Sepsis directly caused the death of a liver disease patient whose condition worsened following two organ transplants, the Coroner’s Court heard on Wednesday. 

Tang Kwai-sze, a hepatitis B carrier, had two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017. She died in August that year at the age of 44.

Two doctors who treated Tang, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for allegedly failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.

Alfred Wong, an intensive care doctor at the hospital, told the Coroner's Court that Tang developed complications and infections after the operations, and required various treatments such as an artificial lung and mechanical ventilation to provide a high concentration of oxygen. 

“She did not do well. She subsequently developed a severe infection to the lungs. After the second liver transplant, her lung condition continued to deteriorate,” Wong told the inquest before Coroner Monica Chow and a five-person jury.

Gavin Chan from the hospital’s department of pathology, who conducted an autopsy on Tang, said sepsis was found to be the direct cause of her death. 

He noted that Tang suffered from a form of pneumonia and a build-up of fluid in the lungs, which were concluded to have contributed to her state.

But Chan said there were no signs of a hepatitis B relapse in the four months between the second transplant and Tang’s death. 

He also took the opportunity at the hearing to speak to Tang’s eldest daughter, Michelle Wu, saying he understood the past several years had not been easy for the family.

”Thank you for allowing me to conduct this autopsy. I hope this could help you understand your mother’s condition more and overcome grief,” he said. 

Wu, in response, bowed and thanked Chan: “No one in your position had said this to me.”

The hearing was set to continue on Thursday.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Indonesian Employers' Association on Wednesday announced plans to help Indonesian businesses set up family offices in the SAR.
 
Speaking to reporters after meeting Chief Executive John Lee, the group's chairwoman, Shinta Kamdani, said Hong Kong has much to offer as an international financial hub. 

"We're exploring what Hong Kong also has to offer in order to facilitate our entry to Hong Kong and also to mainland China. We know that Hong Kong is a big financial hub. I think a lot of projects that Indonesia is now going through will also need a lot of support on resources and facilitation," she said.  

Kamdani, who led a delegation of around 20 business representatives to the city, said the cooperation will cover a wide range of areas such as infrastructure and logistics.

She also said she is not worried about the city's business prospects after the passage of national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law.

"We are more confident that the stability is being upheld here in Hong Kong. I think there were also incidents that's happening that were becoming worrying for some investors. But I do believe moving forward there will be much more confidence," she said. 

Kamdani also dismissed concerns that the recent controversy over a Dubai prince's delayed plan to establish family offices in Hong Kong will impact the launch of her group's plan. 
 
Sheikh Ali Al Maktoum called off an inauguration ceremony just hours before it was scheduled to take place on March 28, sparking questions about his commitment to the project. 

"We don't really see scandals that are happening as a big [deal]. I think a lot of the businesses are very much forward driven, looking for opportunities here. So we're not looking into specific concerns on a specific scandal and so forth. Let's see this as the start of a learning journey," said Kamdani.]]>

    Fewer healthcare workers leaving public sector: govt

    <![CDATA[Health minister Lo Chung-mau said on Wednesday that the turnover rate of public hospital healthcare workers fell in the past financial year, compared with the previous 12 months.

But he added that a worrying trend has developed in that the biggest group of doctors leaving are only in their thirties.

The secretary made the comments at a special Legco finance committee meeting on this year's budget.

Lo said the departure rates of full-time doctors, nurses and allied health professionals ranged from 6.1 to 9.5 percent last year, with the highest rate belonging to nurses.

The numbers ranged from 6.9 to 10.9 percent in 2022-23, and 8.1 to 9.4 percent in 2021-22.

However, Lo said unlike in the past when more doctors in their forties and fifties left public hospitals, recent data showed that the biggest group of doctors quitting now are those aged between 30 and 39.

"So we're worried that when young doctors become specialists, they'll leave the public healthcare system. This is the issue we're facing," the minister said.

"We want to encourage young specialists to stay in the public system to serve Hong Kong."

For his part, the chief executive of the Hospital Authority, Tony Ko, said 118 non-locally trained doctors were hired in the last financial year under limited or special registration schemes.

He said the total number is expected to reach 200 by the end of 2024, with the doctors coming from overseas and the mainland.

Meanwhile, several lawmakers asked whether the government could turn medical facilities used to isolate people during the Covid pandemic into temporary housing.

Lo said the facilities are now under the management of an inter-departmental group led by deputy finance chief Michael Wong, and he expects many of them will soon be switched to "non-medical purposes".]]>

    EPD gives reassurance over food waste recycling bins

    <![CDATA[The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Tuesday said more than 99 percent of its smart food waste recycling bins are functioning normally.

The department also said it will hire additional staff to replace and clean them.

The statement by the EPD followed recent news reports pointing to overflowing or malfunctioning bins in some public housing estates.

The target is to complete the installation of more than 700 smart food waste recycling bins in all 213 public housing estates by August. So far, the department has installed about 530 bins in 70 percent of the estates.

The initiative aims to encourage residents to recycle food waste, with the waste charging scheme due to start on August 1.

The department noted that each bin can collect 120 litres of food waste, and once its inner bin is 70 percent full, the system automatically alerts cleaners to replace it.

Officials also said they have established a warning system to expedite the replacement process. 

“If a bin is unable to operate normally due to being full or malfunctioning for more than an hour, the system will automatically send a notification to the relevant Housing Department estate offices and its cleaning contractors for immediate action,” a spokesman said in a statement. 

The department said an individual bin can meet the food waste collection needs of at least 500 households.

The EPD estimates a participation rate of around 10 to 15 percent from public housing residents in the first year of the recycling programme. It said this rate would likely increase as people become more accustomed to food waste recycling. 

The department also said it will gradually increase the number of bins based on usage data.]]>

    <![CDATA[A man who was among 12 crime suspects caught during an attempt to travel to Taiwan by speedboat in 2020 was jailed for three years and 10 months by the District Court on Tuesday.

Tang Kai-yin, 34, had earlier admitted perverting the course of justice through the escape bid, as well as possessing articles with intent to destroy or damage property during the 2019 protests.

In sentencing, judge Ernest Lin said the defendant was the ringleader when it came to both offences.

Lin said there was no way that Tang and several others didn't know that the materials for making petrol bombs they had in their possession could seriously injure people, and the only conclusion that could be made is that they were trying to cause chaos and confront the police during the social unrest.

The judge added that Tang had bought the speedboat involved in the attempt to flee to Taiwan, and despite not having a licence or any experience in navigation, he had arranged the route for the journey. 

Lin said the defendant had helped those on board the boat escape criminal responsibility and had put them in danger, as well as other vessels on the sea. 

The judge described as "self-inflicted" the three-year prison term Tang served on the mainland after the speedboat was intercepted by the Guangdong coast guard.

While Tang might have made poor decisions amid the heated social atmosphere during the protests, he can't claim to have simply been young and naive, Lin added.

The judge gave Tang 34 months behind bars for possessing the petrol bomb materials and 12 months for organising the escape bid, with the two terms to be served consecutively.]]>

Chan said they discussed Hong Kong's strengths, adding that the body will continue to clarify the clauses of the city's homegrown national security law. 

"The Law Society has the responsibility to continue explaining the clauses of Hong Kong's national security law to society and the international legal community. We have to explain that when compared with some foreign laws, there is actually not much difference," he said. 

Chan said the delegation would visit the General Administration of Sport and explore opportunities such as settling sports disputes and conducting arbitration.]]>

    <![CDATA[The first exam for the Citizenship and Social Development subject for the DSE qualification was held on Tuesday, with some students saying it was not too difficult. 

The subject has replaced Liberal Studies and only has two grades of classification, either “attained” or “unattained”.  

Candidates are required to answer all questions in the paper and the topics covered include education development on the mainland, China’s overall rise in national power, the application of artificial intelligence and national identity recognition.  

At an examination hall in Ho Man Tin, one student said the questions were quite easy and he was confident he could pass.

“That's because the answers can be copied from the data supplied. And by using reasonable deduction, I think I can get the ‘attained’ grade,” he said. 

Another student said the “pass or fail” grades gave him more time to prepare for other subjects.

“It’s less of a psychological burden. I could spend more time on other subjects. Because I don’t need to put too much effort to obtain ‘level four or above’ grade in this subject. I just need to pass, for example to get a 40 or 50 percent score, then I can get into my ideal university,” he said.  

Lit Ho-cheung, who teaches the subject at Scientia Secondary School, said the difficulty and number of questions in the paper were in line with expectations, and believed 90 percent of candidates would pass. 

“I guess the overall wording choices in the questions and the distribution of questions and scores appear to align with our expectations," he said.

"For example, the entire paper has a maximum score of 42, which is probably lower than the score for the liberal studies exams in the past. Since the paper also consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions, candidates should have sufficient time to complete it thoughtfully.”

He added he doesn’t think the paper asked students to take a stand on issues, but rather explain or interpret certain statements with their own words.

Candidates also took part in a compulsory trip to the mainland, earlier in their studies, as part of the curriculum.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Publishing Professionals Society on Tuesday called on the government to promote reading in the city.

In an annual survey conducted by the society last month, nearly 69 percent of the 1,006 respondents said they had a habit of reading physical books, down from 72.72 percent in 2023. 

The number of people who read ebooks remained constant at around 70 percent.

Edmund Chan, the director of City University of Hong Kong Press, told RTHK the findings showed a need to promote reading among residents. 

"In Hong Kong, it's a little bit lagging behind, in the sense that, if we're talking about students, then most students they spend time reading simply because they need to fulfill the requirement of the school or simply they don't have time," he said. 

"Youngsters, as always, they could acquire knowledge out of what they are required. So, it is a self-motivated reading habit that we are promoting, we are advocating." 

The society recommended the government establish additional reading rooms within libraries to create more reading spaces for residents. 

It also urged authorities to introduce "reading vouchers" that would allow youngsters to access their preferred books.

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said his administration would strive to focus on high-quality development, while calling on Hongkongers to stay flexible and chart their own paths in face of changes. 

His comments came a day after Beijing's top man on Hong Kong, Xia Baolong, told the opening ceremony of the National Security Education Day that the SAR should seek and embrace changes. 

Drawing on the speech by the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Lee said Xia was speaking to the whole of the territory. 

"The government should focus on high-quality development. We need to stay focused on the objective, we need to stay on course," he told reporters ahead of the weekly Exco meeting. 

"The commerce industry will have to invoke their innovative ideas. We need to find new growth areas. Different quarters in Hong Kong should work together for the betterment of Hong Kong, so that Hong Kong can once again shine." 

Lee pointed out that Hong Kong is now in a new phase of economic development, calling on people to "ride on the Lion Rock spirit". 

"Hong Kong people need to understand that the landscape has changed. They should take matters into their own hands and they should stay flexible and adaptive," he said. 

The chief executive added the SAR has to integrate into the nation's overall development, which offers Hong Kong the most direct and unlimited opportunities.]]>

    <![CDATA[The SAR government on Tuesday said it strongly disapproved of and rejected what it called “untruthful remarks, slanders and smears” against various aspects of the HKSAR in the UK's six-monthly report on Hong Kong.

A government spokesperson pointed out that the HKSAR is an inalienable part of China, and, as a local administrative region that enjoys a high degree of autonomy under the principle of “One Country, Two Systems”, comes directly under the jurisdiction of the Central People's Government. 

"The UK once again made skewed remarks about Hong Kong by replacing the rule of law with political manipulation and confounding right and wrong, and blatantly interfering in Hong Kong affairs which are entirely China's internal affairs," the spokesperson added.

The spokesperson reiterated that the SAR government resolutely safeguards national sovereignty, security and development interests, and fully and faithfully lives up to the highest principle of “One Country, Two Systems”. 

The SAR government urged the UK to immediately stop actions that are inconsistent with international law and basic norms of international relations, and to immediately stop interfering in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs, said the spokesperson.

The spokesperson pointed out that the content of the British report on Hong Kong's improved electoral system and last year's district council elections are completely untrue. He stressed that in Hong Kong, people of any background can participate in elections in accordance with the law as long as they meet the necessary requirements and are patriots.]]>

    <![CDATA[Penalties for failing to follow fire safety orders will be increased and the authorities will carry out work in private buildings themselves if owners don't rectify problems, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.

His comments follow a fire in Jordan last week that left five people dead, with officials saying the residential building involved had two ongoing non-compliance cases regarding fire safety – one of them dating back to 2008.

Before going into this week's Executive Council meeting, Lee said the authorities want to take swifter action in future to fix fire safety issues.

"There will be a legislative proposal to be made to Legco for the government to be empowered to actually carry out the necessary work to improve fire safety and fire installations, if the responsible person delayed for a long time, or when the hazard is of a type that we think we need to move in," he said.

"Also, we will be making a legislative proposal to increase the penalty for non-compliance with, for example, directions issued by the Buildings Department."

Lee said he believes the government could put forward a bill to Legco sometime this year.]]>
