    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government attached importance to people's views on the waste charging scheme, as officials prepare to present their plans to the Legislative Council next week. 

His comments came after a survey by the Chinese-language newspaper Ta Kung Pao found that more than 90 percent of the 30,000 people polled were against the pay-as-you-throw scheme, while more than 70 percent said it should be scrapped.

The scheme has been on trial since April in 14 different locations, including at homes, shops and restaurants. Officials had previously said it remained to be seen whether a full roll-out would take place as planned on August 1. 

Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said the government was assessing the experience gained during the trial and the challenges that may arise in implementing the law. 

He stressed the government was taking the views of society seriously.

"In my opinion, a policy that would affect more than seven million citizens should be carefully considered. Even though the law was drafted before this government took office, we should still consider how to implement it," he said. 

"We will explain to the Legislative Council next week what we have learnt from the pilot, the problems we have identified and the feedback we have received from the community, including through the media."]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that clear key performance indicators (KPIs) must be set for the development and operation of the West Kowloon Cultural District, adding that government money must be spent carefully. 

He made the comment ahead of the weekly Exco meeting after the chairman of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, Henry Tang, said museums at the arts hub may have to reduce the days they are open unless more funds are secured in the next year or so.

Lee said the government is in communication with the authority regarding viable funding options.

"We have high expectations of the successful operations of West Kowloon Cultural District and it has been creating value for Hong Kong in many areas," he said. 

"It has been doing a job which satisfies the expectations and wishes of the community and the government, but we want to ensure that there will be a long-term viable financing plan with good KPIs."

Lee added that the district was designed to be self-financing following its initial endowment from the government.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee said internet service providers have been complying with a court injunction against the protest song "Glory to Hong Kong".

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said hyperlinks to the song could no longer be found on local platforms. 

"We've noted that there's no link shown on any local platform relating to the song, and also Google Search doesn't show any link to the song in question either," he said. 

"We will continue to monitor the situation to see whether there is any non-compliance with the court order. If we notice such instances, then we will notify the platform on the contents of the court order."

Earlier this month, the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction against the protest song, banning anyone with seditious intent from playing or performing it on national security grounds. 

Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, said last week that it would comply with the court ruling, restricting viewing of 32 banned links related to the song in Hong Kong.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong is set to host dozens more mega events this year which were expected to draw millions of visitors, Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday.

The city's leader also said arts and culture shows, sports competitions, trade exhibitions and financial summits would be among the more than 100 events held in the latter half of the year, including brand new ones such as a performing arts expo and a fashion design week. 

“The total number of mega events over the year is increased from 150 to [over] 210. That means there will be [at least] one mega event every two days," he told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting. 

“We think that these mega events will attract about 1.7 million visitors. They will bring with them about HK$7.2 billion, which is about HK$4.3 billion in economic gain.”

Lee also said Hong Kong welcomed more than 14 million visitors in the first four months, double from the same period a year ago, and that there was a surge of tourists coming from the United States, Canada and Indonesia. 

"We reckon that for every 1.5 million visitors, there will be a 0.1 percent growth in GDP. For long-term stay visitors, they will bring even a higher percentage point in growth of our GDP," he said. 

The CE added his administration would seek more measures from Beijing that benefits the SAR, including raising the duty-free goods allowance for mainland tourists.]]>

    MTR stations better protected from storm flooding

   <description>
    <![CDATA[The MTR has installed a flood detection system at 26 stations, to prepare for the coming rain and typhoon season. 

The initiative comes after Wong Tai Sin Station was flooded during a heavy downpour last September, resulting in the partial suspension of the Kwun Tong Line.

Speaking to reporters, the MTR’s Chief of Airport Segment, Ben Lui, said the rail giant had placed flood sensors at 42 entrances and exits. 

"When water reaches the sensors, it will trigger an alarm to the station staff. Upon receiving the alarm, the staff will check the CCTV to confirm if there is flooding. If there is flooding, our staff will set flood barriers and temporarily cordon off the affected area. There will also be announcements for the public to use other exits to leave the station," he added.

Lui also said the MTR would suspend all services on above ground sections of the network, including the light railway and airport express, whenever the typhoon signal No. 9 or higher was in effect.

However, if trains were still above ground when the second-highest typhoon signal was raised, they would continue to their designated destinations, or at least to major stations such as Yuen Long or Sha Tin, where passengers could find shelter. 

The MTR would also provide water and food for affected passengers under such circumstances.

Lawmaker Gary Zhang said the newly installed flood sensors at station exits would provide early alerts to MTR staff, enabling them to proactively prevent flooding.

However, Zhang, who's a former MTR engineer, expressed concerns regarding the safety of station staff who would need to set up flood-proof barriers themselves amid extreme weather.

"Even for a small station like Wong Tai Sin, there are more than eight entrances, and each entrance has to be installed with floodblocks manually by the station staff. And the manpower is definitely still a concern and also a constraint," he told RTHK.

Zhang said the rail operator was thinking about installing automatic flood-proof barriers at stations to minimise the risks to staff safety.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong’s jobless rate remained stable at three percent in the three-month period ending in April.

Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed that the underemployment rate also remained unchanged, at 1.1 percent.

About 5,700 people were newly employed during the three-month period, bringing the total employment number to 3.69 million. The labour force, meanwhile, increased by about 7,700 to 3.8 million.

However, some 2,000 people became jobless during the period, sending the total number of unemployed to 113,700.

The number of underemployed people stood at 40,500, largely unchanged compared with the previous three-month period.

Commenting on the latest figures, labour chief Chris Sun said the unemployment rates of various sectors remained low in general, with only small changes observed.

He said he expects "continued economic growth" to keep the labour market tight in the near term.

Sun also noted that there was a monthly average of 75,425 vacancies in the private sector between February and April, which was a decrease of nearly 30 percent on a yearly basis and a drop of 2.7 percent compared with the first three months of the year.]]>

    Label issued to "smart and safe" construction sites

    <![CDATA[The Development Bureau and Construction Industry Council have launched a new programme to encourage the use of the Smart Site Safety System on construction sites, with applications open on Monday. 

Sites that successfully implement the system, which includes features like centralised management platforms, monitoring devices for frontline staff and electric locks for hazardous areas, would now be recognised with a label.  

Speaking at the launch ceremony of the programme, Development Secretary Bernadette Linn explained the participation rate for the safety system, especially for private sites, was still relatively low, and such labels were believed to increase their safety awareness.  

“The programme aims to encourage more construction sites to adopt the Smart Site Safety System by providing them with a label, or a ‘plaque’, to identify and facilitate monitoring of those sites that have properly installed and applied the system,” she said. 

“We estimate that the first batch of about 100 construction sites will receive the label by July this year.  With an estimated minimum of 500 sites participating, we hope to have all labels issued by the end of the year, covering over 60 percent of all construction sites.”

She said such labels would be displayed at strategic spots outside the construction sites for recognition.

“In other words, everyone will know which sites have such labels. For sites that don’t have such labels. Obviously relevant government departments will pay more attention during their usual inspections. And the construction industry will know which sites haven’t implemented the Smart Site Safety System. I believe this will create a certain pressure,” she said. 

Linn added that sites should still be cautious even if they have been issued the “plaque”, saying it could still be scrapped if they don't perform site safety properly.]]>

    More mobilised civil servants report on time: govt

    <![CDATA[Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung on Monday said more public servants were able to report for duty on time under a mobilisation protocol used during a government-wide drill on handling emergencies. 

The exercise last month simulated a situation where a super typhoon was approaching Hong Kong, with civil servants called up to assist residents in low-lying areas. 

At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Yeung said the exercise showed that public servants had improved their internal communication, compared to the first drill held about a year ago. 

"The [Civil Service Bureau] worked with different bureaus and departments and we were able to contact all staff required within 40 minutes. And the relevant bureaus and departments also, within a short period time, contacted their staff members. So 99 percent of our staff members were able to arrive at the designated locations within a specified time. This shows that the communication mechanism worked," she told lawmakers.

Yeung added that authorities were able to swiftly deliver supplies from storage facilities set up across the city to specified locations.

Lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung, of the Federation of Trade Unions, raised concerns about civil servants having to catch up their usual work after being deployed under the mechanism. 

In response, Yeung said she believes bureaus and departments would take a "compassionate approach". 

"Say, if the mobilisation exercise [on a work day] completes at 5.30pm, no staff will be asked to go back to their original post to finish their work. The work will be shared among other colleagues," she said.

Government-wide mobilisation went into effect twice last year, with hundreds of civil servants deployed to help clear up the aftermath of Super Typhoon Saola as well as following torrential downpours in September.]]>

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui on Monday said the government will not delay plans to start keeping the stock markets open during severe weather conditions. 

His remark came after reports suggested the authorities could delay bringing in the change until the end of the year or early next year.

Speaking to reporters after attending the China Private Equity Summit, Hui said officials are sticking to the original timeline.

"Our timeline has not been changed, and it's been clear the whole time. That is, we'll announce relevant details of the implementation by the middle of this year when we publish the results of the public consultation on this regard,” Hui said.

“And when the markets are ready, we'll start implementing relevant arrangements.”

No date for the move has been set. 

Earlier, Hui told participants at the summit that Hong Kong remains competitive when it comes to firms raising capital, and authorities will continue to attract leading enterprises from the mainland to list in the SAR.

Separately, Hui also said the SAR government will publish a policy statement regarding the development of artificial intelligence (AI) by the end of this year.

“AI is already being applied in various areas of banking, securities, insurance, accounting, retirement, protection and green finance in Hong Kong,” he said.

“The government will strive to capitalise on the opportunities brought by AI while also managing the risks and challenges.”]]>

    Leave policing to the police: taxi association chief

    <![CDATA[Taxi drivers should not be going undercover to try to tackle unlicensed ride-hailing services and the matter should be left to the police, an industry spokesman said on Monday.

Videos online appear to show cabbies travelling as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police have been called to. 

Chow Kwok-keung, chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, told RTHK he does not agree with such an approach.

He added, however, that there were only 33 prosecutions over unlicensed ride-hailing services last year and the taxi trade is disappointed with the amount of action taken by the authorities. 

"Ride-hailing services are legal, but if these companies do not verify whether or not the cars in service have a hire car permit, the insurance of these cars already becomes invalid. This becomes a problem for all road users including third-party vehicles, pedestrians, passengers and even the driver of the ride-hailing car," he said. 

"If there is a serious accident and there's no compensation for casualties, people would criticise the SAR's governance and nobody wants to see that."

Chow said he hopes plans for new fleets of taxis will improve services, leading to less demand for ride-hailing firms.]]>

    <![CDATA[The chief executive of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Tony Choi, said on Sunday that qualifying for fewer events at the Paris Olympics compared with the Tokyo Games will still be considered a success for Hong Kong athletes.

Speaking on a TVB programme, Choi estimated that Hong Kong would qualify for about 30 events in all disciplines this time, about 10 fewer than in Tokyo three years ago. 

Choi said the SAR's success at the Tokyo Games was partly due to its Covid-19 measures, which minimised the pandemic's impact on elite athletes' training and gave Hong Kong the edge over other places.

Hong Kong won one gold, two silver and three bronze medals in Tokyo, its best showing at an Olympics.

"When the Hong Kong Sports Institute was preparing for the Tokyo Olympics, we didn't stop training for a single day. I believe many countries and regions couldn't do that. So back then, we had such advantages," he said.

"This time, we're getting more than 30 tickets, which is still reaching our target."

Choi also expressed hopes of breaking the pattern of Hong Kong winning medals every other Olympics, since windsurfer Lee Lai-shan captured gold in Atlanta in 1996 for the city's first medal ever.

“We got a medal in the 1996 [Olympics], then in 2000 we didn’t. And in 2004 we had one and 2008 we didn’t. 2012 we got a medal then 2016 we didn’t... Honestly speaking, the Hong Kong team’s results are relatively inconsistent. We hope everything can be more stable,” he said. 

“We hope to win at least a medal in every Olympics... We need to maintain a stable performance in the international sports scene in order to compete with other sports powerhouses.”

Choi said Hong Kong is already competitive in sports such as fencing, swimming, table tennis, badminton, karate and squash, and it'll take time to catch up in other disciplines.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police on Sunday said they have arrested two people on suspicion of vandalising a tombstone in Tseung Kwan O Chinese Permanent Cemetery.

According to video circulating online, it belonged to Wong Ka-kui, the late singer of the now-disbanded musical band, Beyond.

The video purportedly showed someone smashing the tombstone with a hammer, as well as spraying liquid and writing with a black marker on it.

Officers said the pair arrested are aged 15 and 23.

Writing on social media, a former member of Beyond, Yip Sai-wing, called the incident "truly outrageous" and said anyone found guilty of carrying out the act must be punished.

Wong died in 1993 at the age of 31.]]>

    <![CDATA[The DAB on Sunday called on the government to transform the disused Covid isolation facility in Kai Tak into a base for the arts and sport.

Speaking at a press briefing, lawmaker Starry Lee said the facility, spanning around 80,000 square metres, has remained unused for a long time while incurring a monthly maintenance cost of HK$400,000.

"Now, we believe it is a good time to sort of restructure and reshape (it) as an international exchange art, sport hub, because this can leverage on the existing facility including the opening of the sport centre in Kai Tak area and also we have the cruise terminal," she said.

"We are expecting more tourists to come through the cruise terminal."

Lee, who represents the Kowloon Central geographical constituency, suggested the government develop a water sports centre, a dedicated space for youth art creation, as well as an exhibition area to showcase Hong Kong's intangible cultural heritage within the Kai Tak complexes.

But she said the transportation facilities in the Kai Tak area are inadequate, and called on the government to expedite the development of an eco-transportation system there.

Last month, Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn told the Legislative Council that the government was considering turning the Covid-19 isolation facility in Kai Tak into a hub for the cultural and creative industries.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police said they have seized about 225 kilograms of suspected cocaine at a warehouse in Ta Kwu Ling and arrested two men.

They said the haul had a market value of HK$204 million.

Police said the suspected drugs were hidden among containers said to be carrying scrap iron and shipped from the South American country of Suriname.

Officers raided the warehouse in Ping Che on Friday.

“Our investigation reviewed that the drug-trafficking syndicate employed some, we believe, unwitting truck workers to assist them to dismantle approximately those 40 tonnes of scrap iron from the containers, with the syndicate overseeing the unloading,” superintendent Wilson Tam said in a press briefing on Sunday.

“Subsequently, our officers conducted the raid, and we found two workers and arrested the other two suspected members of the drug syndicate.”

The pair, aged 22 and 29, were held on suspicion of trafficking in dangerous drugs and will appear before Fanling Magistrates' Courts on Monday.

Tam added that intelligence indicated the suspected drugs were being stored in Hong Kong before they were to be sold in other countries.]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said while the macro-economy and investment sentiment have improved in recent months, not all industries in Hong Kong are recovering at the same pace. 

Writing on his weekly blog, Chan noted that local stocks traded near nine-month highs earlier this month and home prices rebounded in March after a 10-month fall, but he acknowledged that retailers and restaurant operators still face challenges.

"Indeed, the recovery is still uneven among different industries. The retail and catering sectors are still adapting to the challenges brought by changes in the consumption patterns of residents and tourists," he wrote.

"In response to market changes, we take the initiative and strive to create more favourable market conditions and atmospheres. We work with the business community to create new opportunities of growth for Hong Kong."

Chan added that the government will announce shortly mega events planned for the second half of the year.

He vowed to create tourism experiences with unique characteristics of the SAR to boost consumption.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Jockey Club on Saturday announced that it's boosting the prize fund for special Snowball draws in its Mark Six lottery, making the big-money jackpots more frequent and larger.

The club said it would start the new arrangements from Tuesday's draw, with more money being held back for the Snowball. It says the number of Snowball draws will rise from about seven per year to 12, while the top prize will be up to HK$100 million for some draws.

The club said in a statement: "The Snowball draw is a major attraction of the Mark Six."

The club said the minimum prize for regular draws would remain unchanged at HK$8 million, while other variable and fized prize allocations would also stay the same.

It noted that the majority of lottery revenue after payouts goes on benefitting the Hong Kong community, with 40 percent of lottery turnover going on taxes or into the lotteries fund.]]>

    Truck driver arrested over light rail incident

    <![CDATA[Police on Saturday said they have arrested a truck driver on suspicion of causing a light rail carriage to derail, and disrupting light rail services in the western New Territories for about three hours.

It is suspected that a plank, measuring 50 centimetres by 20 centimetres, fell from the truck the man was driving onto the light rail tracks.

Officers arrested the 49-year-old man for alleged dangerous driving.

The incident occurred at around 9:40am, when a carriage derailed near Chung Uk Tsuen Station and affected light rail routes 610, 614, 615, and 715.

As a result, services were suspended at Lam Tei, Nai Wai, Chung Uk Tsuen and Hung Shui Kiu stations. But there were no injuries.

The MTR Corporation said it's investigating the incident, adding a preliminary investigation found that the train involved was not speeding.

Citing sources, lawmaker Gary Zhang, the deputy chairman of the subcommittee on matters relating to railways at the Legislative Council, said the incident happened at a busy crossing.

“Although the incident is unrelated to the operations and maintenance of the light rail services, I think the MTR Corporation can still use technology to prevent similar incidents from happening again. For example, they can consider installing AI cameras at its junctions, or maybe install some vehicle-based detection systems so that early detections can be done,” he said.

Zhang doesn't expect the incident to trigger any penalty mechanisms.

Separately, the city’s transport chief Lam Sai-hung said that he had expressed concern about the incident. 

The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) has conducted an immediate investigation at the scene of the incident and will study improvement measures along with the MTR Corporation.

    <![CDATA[The government on Saturday said there are more companies than ever in Hong Kong, which shows that the city is a vibrant, reliable and convenient place to do business.

The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau said there are over 1.43 million local companies and around 15,000 non-local firms as of April - both record high figures for Hong Kong.

The bureau said new companies were emerging, outnumbering those that folded by about 4,600 last month.

Meanwhile, it said the number of bankruptcy and winding up petitions fell in April.

The authorities received 742 bankruptcy and 66 winding up petitions last month. The figures were slightly lower than those in March, but still at least 30 percent up from a year ago.]]>
