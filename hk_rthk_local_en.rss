    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA) said all DSE exam centres must return unused question-and-answer books to the authority starting from Saturday.

The announcement came after the English listening exam paper was said to have been uploaded to social media platform Xiaohongshu, and police arrested a 23-year-old woman in relation to the incident.

A spokesman for the HKEAA said for exams held on Saturday onwards, the centres must return all unused question-and-answer books to the collection centre on the same day.

The HKEAA said the arrangement would help manage examination materials more effectively and minimise the risk of information being made available publicly on the internet.]]>

    Government condemns statement by G7 foreign ministers

    <![CDATA[The government on Saturday strongly condemned a statement issued by foreign ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) countries and the High Representative of the European Union, saying it deliberately misled the public and smeared the National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.

A government spokesman described the statement as "unfounded and biased". He stressed that it was Hong Kong's constitutional duty to safeguard national security. 

"Many common law jurisdictions, including western countries such as the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as Singapore, have enacted multiple pieces of legislation to safeguard national security," he said. 

"Turning a blind eye to the fact and making exaggerated remarks, the G7 foreign ministers and the High Representative of the EU have demonstrated typical political hegemony and hypocrisy with double standards." 

The G7 statement expressed concerns about civil and political rights and freedoms in Hong Kong in light of the introduction of the National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance under Article 23 of the Basic Law. 

The government spokesman dismissed the criticism, saying that the legislation would not affect normal business operations, adding that law-abiding businessmen and travellers visiting Hong Kong would not engage in activities that endanger national security and therefore would not unknowingly violate the law.

He added that a majority of the submissions received during the public consultation on the legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law were supportive and positive, reflecting a strong consensus in society for the legislation.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Department of Health on Saturday said it had ordered the Union Hospital to hand in a report after hackers attacked its computer system.

Responding to media enquiries, the department said it was notified by the hospital on Monday about the cyberattack, which affected operations.

It said initial understandings showed that the incident did not involve patients' information or affect the safety of hospital services.

The authorities said the investigation is ongoing and it had ordered the hospital to submit a detailed report within a month.

The hospital earlier said it had reported the case to the police as well as the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, and announced it had stepped up measures to prevent further attacks.

"The hospital has activated an emergency response system and stepped up cybersecurity measures to block further intrusion. A team of cyber security experts has been appointed to conduct a thorough system inspection and recovery in order to ensure medical service continuity," it wrote in a statement.]]>

    <![CDATA[Customs authorities on Saturday reported a significant increase in cannabis seizures during the first quarter of this year. 

A total of 1.28 tonnes of cannabis was seized, more than half the total seized last year.

Officers arrested 31 people, including two teenagers, suspected of being involved in drug trafficking.

Authorities have highlighted the various methods used by traffickers to smuggle cannabis, such as hiding it in pet food or secret compartments in wooden tables.

In one recent case, officers intercepted a shipment of car wheels and discovered a hidden stash of 100 kilograms of cannabis, worth about HK$23 million.

Customs officials said they would continue their efforts to enforce the law by using new technology.

They noted that cannabis has been legalised in some countries, leading to a misconception among some people that it is harmless and non-addictive.]]>

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said most people think the upcoming waste charging scheme is causing a nuisance to the public. 

The government began testing the scheme at 14 locations from this month, including at public and private residential blocks, and people involved in the trial were provided with free designated garbage bags.

Speaking on a television programme, the minister said about half of the residents living in private residential blocks participated in the test run, but only ten percent of those living in three-nil buildings joined the trial.

He added that opinions on the scheme vary.

"A few residents reflected that it's good to do waste separation and reduction. But a majority of them thought it's causing nuisance to the public because they have to pay for rubbish bags," he said.

Tse said it remains to be seen whether the scheme will go ahead as planned on August 1.

Meanwhile, the first phase of the ban on plastic tableware will start next Monday, and restaurants will be barred from selling and using disposable polystyrene tableware, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.

Asked about people reflecting that paper and wood cutlery were difficult to use, Tse said it takes time for people to get used to tableware made of different materials.

He said the catering sector may find various substitutions for plastic tableware.]]>

    <![CDATA[Liberal Party leader Tommy Cheung on Saturday expressed a positive outlook for local businesses for the upcoming Labour Day "Golden Week" holiday on the mainland. 

Cheung, who represents the catering sector, said he expects an increase in the number of mainland tourists staying overnight. 

He added that restaurants have increased their staff in anticipation of a surge in number of visitors.

"Because it's a five-day holiday for China, so I'm expecting more people to come. In fact, not just for the first of May, even second, third, fourth and fifth. I'm expecting more people coming in than going out. We are prepared for the week," he said. 

Meanwhile, Cheung expects a forthcoming ban on the sale and use of disposable plastic tableware to be implemented smoothly. 
 
He said many restaurants had already understood the new regulations and were making the necessary preparations to adapt to the changes.]]>

    <![CDATA[The chairman of the Elderly Commission on Saturday said he hopes the government can allow mainland-operated care homes to join the cross-boundary elderly care scheme. 

Under current policy, elderly people in queue for subsidised care homes in Hong Kong can apply for care homes in the nine Greater Bay Area cities on the mainland, but only those operated by Hong Kong organisations. 

Speaking on an RTHK programme, Donald Li said by expanding the scheme, the elderly can have more options, provided that a review system is enforced for quality control of service.

"Most people are concerned about the financial health of care homes, to know whether they can operate in the long term. People are also concerned about the hygiene of care homes, and whether carers received training or not. The government is doing inspections now," he said.

He admitted that the waiting time for elderly care home admission is long and urged to allocate places for those in need.]]>

    Civil service chief vows to recruit new blood

    <![CDATA[The Secretary for the Civil Service, Ingrid Yeung, has vowed to go the extra mile in hiring new public servants, while acknowledging recruitment has not been easy.

On RTHK's "Your Home Address" programme broadcast on Saturday, Yeung said the civil service workforce currently has about a 10 percent vacancy rate, due mainly to a shortage of labour in the market and the period being the peak of retirement. 

She said the administration could only hire locally, but made it clear it's working hard to recruit new blood. 

"I can trawl from the home base, I can only use local talents... Almost all employers in Hong Kong are snatching talents from each other, and the local graduates are very welcomed by employers in every sector," she said. 

"So we have to make extra efforts in recruitment and we have been making extra efforts. Last year, we have launched this scheme of allowing students in their penultimate year of study, not in their final year of study, to apply for civil service jobs as well." 

The minister also said the aim of a planned updated code of conduct for civil servants is to spell out what is expected of public workers.

"It is in the civil servants' daily work when they come into contact with different political parties, with politicians, that they should remain neutral. With regard to the government's work, with regard to what the government is doing, they should support wholeheartedly. There is no room for them to say that, 'Oh, I'm neutral, I do not support and I do not object to this government initiative.'," Yeung said. 

According to the draft Civil Service Code, which includes 12 core values and standards of conduct, civil servants must not refuse to implement government policies they do not agree with, or adopt a passive attitude in implementing them.]]>

    Insufficient load test led to DC poll glitch: EAC

   <description>
    <![CDATA[A technical team behind the electronic poll register system, which failed during December's District Council polls, did not conduct sufficient load test on the programme, the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) concluded on Friday. 

In a report on the citywide polls, the watchdog also recommended the Registration and Electoral Office to identify experts in fixing the system's issues and run simulations of a large-scale election regularly. 

Last year, the glitch led to authorities extending voting hours by one and a half hours, and polling stations switching to printed copies of the voter register to issue ballot papers.

The report noted that design issues of the electronic poll register system caused the central processing unit to overload and unnecessarily tied up a substantial amount of resources in the server when electoral staff tried to log in to the programme. 

"When altering the system design, the [Registration and Electoral Office's] technical team did not fully consider the cumulative effect and impacts on loading that might be induced to the system during actual operation, and therefore did not conduct sufficient and comprehensive load test," the report said. 

The commission said the electoral office should identify suitable experts to rectify design issues and conduct "adequate, comprehensive and stringent tests", while running simulated large-scale elections on a regular basis.

"The [Registration and Electoral Office] should learn a lesson from this system failure, and actively implement the above recommendations to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents in future," it said. 

"As to whether any individual officers should be held responsible for the incident, it will be followed up by the administration according to the established procedures."]]>

    <![CDATA[The president of the Law Society on Friday said Beijing officials they had met during their visit to the capital approved of their work in safeguarding the rule of law. 

Wrapping up their four-day trip to Beijing, CM Chan said they had met representatives of 12 organisations, including the Ministry of Justice and the Basic Law Committee.

Chan said the officials praised the society for remaining impartial and professional when discussing major legal issues, and for using simple language to explain the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance to members of the public during the legislative process.

"The Law Society understands that safeguarding national security and protecting freedoms is not a zero-sum game. I am very confident that with the judicial independence in Hong Kong, a balance can be struck," he told reporters.

"The Law Society of Hong Kong submitted a lot of professional opinions to the Hong Kong government during the consultation period. And we got the message that the leaders recognised our work and our contribution in safeguarding the rule of law."

Chan added that they sought business opportunities during their visit.

He said his delegation visited the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the General Administration of Sport for the first time, to explain how the SAR's legal profession can provide services for the commercial and sport sectors.]]>

    <![CDATA[Labour officials on Friday said special task forces set up to inspect construction sites have initiated more than 340 prosecutions against unsafe practices over the past few months.

The inspection groups, established by the Labour Department following a number of fatal industrial accidents, also issued nearly 800 improvement or suspension notices, after conducting checks on almost 660 sites between November 2023 and February this year. 

At a special Legco Finance Committee meeting, lawmaker Chau Siu-hung asked if the administration had assessed the effectiveness of the inspection squads and whether authorities plan to deploy them again.

Commissioner for Labour May Chan said in response that the work of inspection squads had been effective. 

"We conduct inspections through the special task forces, and also through other means. We put in a lot of resources to carry out inspections by special task forces. We also hold surprise checks or random inspections. We have yielded results through these surprise checks," Chan said. 

"As to whether we will ask the special task forces to carry out more inspections in the future, we will look into it." 

Meanwhile, deputy commissioner for labour Vincent Fung said officials will do more to promote a revised code of practice for bamboo scaffolding safety which was gazetted on Friday. 

The amendments stipulate that those working on bamboo scaffolds must undergo training and hold a valid certificate. The revised code also prohibits any unauthorised alteration of scaffolds. 

"Considering the time required for the industry to arrange training to obtain the certificates, there will be a grace period of six months on the effective date of the revised [code of practice]. It will take effect on October 19 to allow the industry to have sufficient time for preparation," a department spokesperson said. 

The updated guide was published two months after a large scaffolding collapsed at a construction site in Kai Tak, killing two workers and injuring three others.]]>

    <![CDATA[The trial of Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai on Friday heard he intended to groom a key figure linked to the 2019 unrest, Finn Lau, to become a "political star", but that Lau was cool to the idea.

Testifying for another day as an accomplice witness, paralegal Chan Tsz-wah spoke about a meeting in Taiwan in January 2020 that he, Lai, Lau and others attended.

The trial heard the Apple Daily founder wanted to cultivate Lau by offering him £10,000 in living expenses and helping to build a political network, with the aim of causing the collapse of the Chinese government and economy.

Chan said Lai's anti-China policy also included economic blockades and sanctions.

But the court was told that Lau "did not want to become a political star".

Chan also said Lai wanted to support political newcomers in the pan-democratic primaries in the 2020 Legco elections.

The former media tycoon has denied three conspiracy charges relating to collusion with foreign forces and sedition. 

The trial continues.]]>

    <![CDATA[Sacrificing wetlands to build a new technology hub in the northern part of Hong Kong could cause "irreversible damage" to the habitat of endangered black-faced spoonbills, an environmentalist group warned on Friday, although it reported a rise in the number of the rare migratory birds found in the city. 

The Hong Kong Bird Watching Society's director, Yu Yat-tung, said wetlands in Hong Kong could not be reduced further, voicing concerns that filing in fishponds for the San Tin Technopole project could result in the largest wetland loss in the past three decades. 

"We are talking about a zero loss of wetlands. I think this is a very important policy for us to work towards wetland conservation," he said. "We need to make sure that no wetland can be lost in any development projects from now on and the future." 

His comments came as an annual census conducted in January by the society found 6,988 of the rare migratory birds across the world – a 5.4 percent rise from the year before – marking the third straight year that such figures surpassed 6,000.

In Hong Kong, 375 were spotted in the latest study, up by a quarter from the previous year. But the number of migratory birds in the territory only made up around five percent of the global population. 

"[The figure] is just returning to the previous, normal range of black-faced spoonbills. In the past 10 years, we could usually have about 300 to 400 black-faced spoonbills wintering in Hong Kong," Yu said. 

"We hope the situation can further improve in the coming future, so we need to do many more wetland conservation activities to make sure this can happen."

Taiwan was once again the top winter destination for black-faced spoonbills, with nearly 60 percent of the bird's worldwide population, even though the total number found there dropped slightly. 

The mainland attracted 1,630 spoonbills this year, while Macau recorded the largest decline of 38 percent.]]>

    <![CDATA[Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Friday said it's not hard for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to meet the requirements for a new social welfare subsidy allocation system which rewards support for government policies. 

Groups would score higher if they had organised or co-hosted activities supporting official policies in recent years. 

At a special Legco Finance Committee meeting discussing the budget, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said people have asked him for clarity on the matter, and he didn't know the answer. 

In response, Sun said the new system encourages NGOs to show their commitment to patriotism, and it doesn't matter what kind of activities are involved, so long as the groups took part.

"We want these NGOs to love our country and love Hong Kong," he told lawmakers.

"For example, for our National Day, or after 'The Two Sessions', the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, maybe the NGOs can organise some seminars to share the ideas proposed in these meetings."

Meanwhile, the minister stressed the government had no plans to scrap the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme for the elderly and the disabled.

The administration has started a review of the system after expenditure for the scheme in the current financial year was projected to increase by 50 percent year-on-year, to more than HK$6 billion.

Sun stressed as officials hope to complete a review this year, they would consider ways to extend the scheme in an affordable manner.

He noted the policy’s intent was to encourage the elderly to go out more, to benefit their mental health and relationships.

The minister said the government was aware there were different views on the issue and it would try to balance them.]]>

    <![CDATA[Cathay Pacific on Friday said it aims to recruit 5,000 more staff this year and reach 80 percent of its pre-pandemic capacity in the second quarter. 

The city’s flagship carrier said it is most in need of flight attendants and customer service officers including cargo and ground staff. 

Patricia Hwang, the airline's Director People, said it would also expand mainland and overseas recruitment to hire more pilots. 

“In terms of pilots, right now we have got around 2,900 pilots and we forecast that we need to recruit another 500 to support our rebuild journey and to resume our capacity back to the pre-pandemic level,” she told reporters at a recruitment roadshow event.

“We have got confidence that we will be able to recruit and attract all the pilots that we need to support our rebuild and of course we will not only recruit from Hong Kong, we will also recruit from the Chinese mainland, as well as different overseas countries.”

Hwang added that more than 100 mainland cabin crew members had been trained and are now providing services since Cathay started hiring from across the border last August. 

A Cathay Pacific pilot union earlier said the carrier is very short of experienced pilots despite its recruitment expansion, warning it could take years for the airline to recover from the pandemic. 

But Nazia, a candidate who applied for a customer service post, expressed confidence in the company's prospects. 

"Obviously, Covid-19 was quite an unfortunate event that everyone had to suffer. So I can understand the different pressures on business and different entities. But honestly, looking forward, I think it would be a long term position for me if I do get into Cathay Pacific. I think it's really reasonable for different firms to lay off staff. But I think right now, Cathay Pacific is also doing quite well," she said. 

Cathay said it wants to achieve full pre-Covid capacity in the first quarter of next year.]]>

    Don't let blunders affect digitalisation: Sun Dong

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, on Friday said he hoped government departments and public bodies would keep rolling out digital services, despite various hiccups over the past year. 

At a special finance committee meeting in Legco discussing this year's budget, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien asked about accountability issues, after seeing problems with apps to do with sports venue booking, tunnel tolls and public exams. 

Tien noted these tech hiccups made it seem as if “Murphy's law” was coming true — "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and has gone wrong," he said.

In response, Sun said in recent months, the government had required new services to go through third party stress tests vetted by its top IT office, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO). 

He said the latest problems had made officials think about extending stringent tests to public bodies.

The minister said there are hundreds of government departments and public bodies, so it's impossible for the office to cast an eye on everything, adding the IT teams of some government departments were actually bigger those at the OGCIO.

As authorities continue building a digital government and a smart city, Sun said the system must change, and the future Digital Policy Office to be formed will steer policies, besides offering technical support.

The IT chief said despite the shortcomings, he hopes officials won't "shrink back" and would continue to play their part in the city’s ongoing digitalisation. 

"All good policies are drawn up on the basis of blunders, painful lessons learned. So we need to look forward, we must not be hesitant because of the blunders and problems," Sun told lawmakers.

Meanwhile, the minister said the government's planned artificial intelligence supercomputer centre at Cyberport would operate under a market-driven model, with clear pricing policies.

He said while the government has yet to seek public funding for the centre, Cyberport has raised funds for the project with help from the administration, because of its urgency and what he called abrupt changes to the international situation last year.

The goal remains for the centre to open this year, Sun said.]]>

    <![CDATA[The government on Friday said it plans to let the Airport Authority install an artificial reef off Chek Lap Kok to enhance ecological and fisheries resources there.

Authorities said the reef would provide shelter and nursery grounds for marine life in northwest Lantau waters.

The project would see around 1,000 artificial reef units deployed around 25 hectares of seabed in the airport's approach area No. 3. 

The project was due to commence mid-year at the earliest and was expected to be completed in the second half of 2024.

Around a dozen artificial reef zones have been installed in Hong Kong waters, including one off Chek Lap Kok that is a feeding station for Chinese White Dolphins.]]>

    Over 100 non-HK firms invest in city this year: govt

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, on Friday said the government was on course to beat a target of attracting 1,130 outside firms to invest in Hong Kong within a three-year period. 

At a special finance committee meeting in Legco discussing this year's budget, he said officials enabled 382 firms to set up here last year, and 150 in the first three months of 2024. 

Yau said these companies came from places like the mainland, Japan, Singapore, the UK and the US.

The head of InvestHK, Alpha Lau, said some of these companies might not have made big splashes with their promotional campaigns.

"Some may want to come to Hong Kong, they'd like to use the SAR as a springboard into the mainland market, or some mainland enterprises would like to come here and use Hong Kong as a platform," she told lawmakers.

"But then they want to stay low profile as a result of geopolitical tensions."

Yau also expressed hope the SAR could become a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) this year, which is the world's biggest free trade agreement in terms of GDP.

He told lawmakers it normally takes 18 months for RCEP members to vet applications, and the group only started dealing with the requests in June last year. 

Meanwhile, New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip said she thinks it's not necessary to spend HK$33.5 million on the SAR's Economic and Trade Office in London, urging the government to cut costs.

"[The office in London] is not very useful nowadays... Because the positions of those anti-China politicians are pre-determined. No matter what you say, it's pointless," the lawmaker said.

The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau said in response that not only does the office in London handle affairs in the UK, it's also in charge of matters in other parts of Europe, so officials consider the current deployments to be suitable.

At the same meeting, lawmaker Shang Hailong raised concern  about the use of online media by the government.

Official figures showed RTHK, the government broadcaster overseen by the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, had 1.38 million followers on Facebook as of the end of February, and Shang asked if the number was on the low side.

In response, Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said the station's YouTube channel also had more than one million followers, or 17 rating points in terms of viewership, adding whether that reading was low or not was open for interpretation.
