    <![CDATA[Sepsis directly caused the death of a liver disease patient whose condition worsened following two organ transplants, the Coroner’s Court heard on Wednesday. 

Tang Kwai-sze, a hepatitis B carrier, had two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017. She died in August that year at the age of 44.

Two doctors who treated Tang, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for allegedly failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.

Alfred Wong, an intensive care doctor at the hospital, told the Coroner's Court that Tang developed complications and infections after the operations, and required various treatments such as an artificial lung and mechanical ventilation to provide a high concentration of oxygen. 

“She did not do well. She subsequently developed a severe infection to the lungs. After the second liver transplant, her lung condition continued to deteriorate,” Wong told the inquest before Coroner Monica Chow and a five-person jury.

Gavin Chan from the hospital’s department of pathology, who conducted an autopsy on Tang, said sepsis was found to be the direct cause of her death. 

He noted that Tang suffered from a form of pneumonia and a build-up of fluid in the lungs, which were concluded to have contributed to her state.

But Chan said there were no signs of a hepatitis B relapse in the four months between the second transplant and Tang’s death. 

He also took the opportunity at the hearing to speak to Tang’s eldest daughter, Michelle Wu, saying he understood the past several years had not been easy for the family.

”Thank you for allowing me to conduct this autopsy. I hope this could help you understand your mother’s condition more and overcome grief,” he said. 

Wu, in response, bowed and thanked Chan: “No one in your position had said this to me.”

The hearing was set to continue on Thursday.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Indonesian Employers' Association on Wednesday announced plans to help Indonesian businesses set up family offices in the SAR.
 
Speaking to reporters after meeting Chief Executive John Lee, the group's chairwoman, Shinta Kamdani, said Hong Kong has much to offer as an international financial hub. 

"We're exploring what Hong Kong also has to offer in order to facilitate our entry in Hong Kong and also to mainland China. We know that Hong Kong is a big financial hub. I think a lot of projects that Indonesia is now going through will also need a lot of support on resources and facilitation," she said.  

Kamdani, who led a delegation of around 20 business representatives to the city, said the cooperation will cover a wide range of areas such as infrastructure and logistics.

She also said she is not worried about the city's business prospects after the passage of national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law.

"We are more confident that the stability is being upheld here in Hong Kong. I think there were also incidents that's happening that were becoming worrying for some investors. But I do believe moving forward there will be much more confidence," she said. 

Kamdani also dismissed concerns that the recent controversy over a Dubai prince's delayed plan to establish family offices in Hong Kong will impact the launch of her group's plan. 
 
Sheikh Ali Al Maktoum called off an inauguration ceremony just hours before it was scheduled to take place on March 28, sparking questions about his commitment to the project. 

"We don't really see scandals that are happening as a big [deal]. I think a lot of the businesses are very much forward driven, looking for opportunities here. So we're not looking into specific concerns on a specific scandal and so forth. Let's see this as the start of a learning journey," said Kamdani.]]>

    Fewer healthcare workers leaving public sector: govt

    <![CDATA[Health minister Lo Chung-mau said on Wednesday that the turnover rate of public hospital healthcare workers fell in the past financial year, compared with the previous 12 months.

But he added that a worrying trend has developed in that the biggest group of doctors leaving are only in their thirties.

The secretary made the comments at a special Legco finance committee meeting on this year's budget.

Lo said the departure rates of full-time doctors, nurses and allied health professionals ranged from 6.1 to 9.5 percent last year, with the highest rate belonging to nurses.

The numbers ranged from 6.9 to 10.9 percent in 2022-23, and 8.1 to 9.4 percent in 2021-22.

However, Lo said unlike in the past when more doctors in their forties and fifties left public hospitals, recent data showed that the biggest group of doctors quitting now are those aged between 30 and 39.

"So we're worried that when young doctors become specialists, they'll leave the public healthcare system. This is the issue we're facing," the minister said.

"We want to encourage young specialists to stay in the public system to serve Hong Kong."

For his part, the chief executive of the Hospital Authority, Tony Ko, said 118 non-locally trained doctors were hired in the last financial year under limited or special registration schemes.

He said the total number is expected to reach 200 by the end of 2024, with the doctors coming from overseas and the mainland.

Meanwhile, several lawmakers asked whether the government could turn medical facilities used to isolate people during the Covid pandemic into temporary housing.

Lo said the facilities are now under the management of an inter-departmental group led by deputy finance chief Michael Wong, and he expects many of them will soon be switched to "non-medical purposes".]]>

    <![CDATA[The Examinations and Assessment Authority on Tuesday said it will take serious action against anyone posting DSE exam paper online and report such matters to the police. 

The exams authority was responding to a case in which this year's English listening exam paper was posted on the social media platform "Xiaohongshu". 

A photo circulating online purportedly showed the paper was posted by an exam marker.

The exam was held last week.

The exams authority said all staff must keep its matters confidential. It reminded examination staff not to publish or re-post exam content in any form.]]>

    EPD gives reassurance over food waste recycling bins

    <![CDATA[The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Tuesday said more than 99 percent of its smart food waste recycling bins are functioning normally.

The department also said it will hire additional staff to replace and clean them.

The statement by the EPD followed recent news reports pointing to overflowing or malfunctioning bins in some public housing estates.

The target is to complete the installation of more than 700 smart food waste recycling bins in all 213 public housing estates by August. So far, the department has installed about 530 bins in 70 percent of the estates.

The initiative aims to encourage residents to recycle food waste, with the waste charging scheme due to start on August 1.

The department noted that each bin can collect 120 litres of food waste, and once its inner bin is 70 percent full, the system automatically alerts cleaners to replace it.

Officials also said they have established a warning system to expedite the replacement process. 

“If a bin is unable to operate normally due to being full or malfunctioning for more than an hour, the system will automatically send a notification to the relevant Housing Department estate offices and its cleaning contractors for immediate action,” a spokesman said in a statement. 

The department said an individual bin can meet the food waste collection needs of at least 500 households.

The EPD estimates a participation rate of around 10 to 15 percent from public housing residents in the first year of the recycling programme. It said this rate would likely increase as people become more accustomed to food waste recycling. 

The department also said it will gradually increase the number of bins based on usage data.]]>

    <![CDATA[A man who was among 12 crime suspects caught during an attempt to travel to Taiwan by speedboat in 2020 was jailed for three years and 10 months by the District Court on Tuesday.

Tang Kai-yin, 34, had earlier admitted perverting the course of justice through the escape bid, as well as possessing articles with intent to destroy or damage property during the 2019 protests.

In sentencing, judge Ernest Lin said the defendant was the ringleader when it came to both offences.

Lin said there was no way that Tang and several others didn't know that the materials for making petrol bombs they had in their possession could seriously injure people, and the only conclusion that could be made is that they were trying to cause chaos and confront the police during the social unrest.

The judge added that Tang had bought the speedboat involved in the attempt to flee to Taiwan, and despite not having a licence or any experience in navigation, he had arranged the route for the journey. 

Lin said the defendant had helped those on board the boat escape criminal responsibility and had put them in danger, as well as other vessels on the sea. 

The judge described as "self-inflicted" the three-year prison term Tang served on the mainland after the speedboat was intercepted by the Guangdong coast guard.

While Tang might have made poor decisions amid the heated social atmosphere during the protests, he can't claim to have simply been young and naive, Lin added.

The judge gave Tang 34 months behind bars for possessing the petrol bomb materials and 12 months for organising the escape bid, with the two terms to be served consecutively.]]>

    <![CDATA[The president of the Law Society on Tuesday said members will continue to explore opportunities for the legal sector, as a delegation started a four-day visit to Beijing.

Speaking to reporters in the capital, Chan Chak-ming said they met the deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Nong Rong.

Chan said they discussed Hong Kong's strengths, adding that the body will continue to clarify the clauses of the city's homegrown national security law. 

"The Law Society has the responsibility to continue explaining the clauses of Hong Kong's national security law to society and the international legal community. We have to explain that when compared with some foreign laws, there is actually not much difference," he said. 

Chan said the delegation would visit the General Administration of Sport and explore opportunities such as settling sports disputes and conducting arbitration.]]>

    'Not hard to pass subject replacing liberal studies'

    <![CDATA[The first exam for the Citizenship and Social Development subject for the DSE qualification was held on Tuesday, with some students saying it was not too difficult. 

The subject has replaced Liberal Studies and only has two grades of classification, either “attained” or “unattained”.  

Candidates are required to answer all questions in the paper and the topics covered include education development on the mainland, China’s overall rise in national power, the application of artificial intelligence and national identity recognition.  

At an examination hall in Ho Man Tin, one student said the questions were quite easy and he was confident he could pass.

“That's because the answers can be copied from the data supplied. And by using reasonable deduction, I think I can get the ‘attained’ grade,” he said. 

Another student said the “pass or fail” grades gave him more time to prepare for other subjects.

“It’s less of a psychological burden. I could spend more time on other subjects. Because I don’t need to put too much effort to obtain ‘level four or above’ grade in this subject. I just need to pass, for example to get a 40 or 50 percent score, then I can get into my ideal university,” he said.  

Lit Ho-cheung, who teaches the subject at Scientia Secondary School, said the difficulty and number of questions in the paper were in line with expectations, and believed 90 percent of candidates would pass. 

“I guess the overall wording choices in the questions and the distribution of questions and scores appear to align with our expectations," he said.

"For example, the entire paper has a maximum score of 42, which is probably lower than the score for the liberal studies exams in the past. Since the paper also consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions, candidates should have sufficient time to complete it thoughtfully.”

He added he doesn’t think the paper asked students to take a stand on issues, but rather explain or interpret certain statements with their own words.

Candidates also took part in a compulsory trip to the mainland, earlier in their studies, as part of the curriculum.]]>

    Local publishers urge govt to promote reading

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Publishing Professionals Society on Tuesday called on the government to promote reading in the city.

In an annual survey conducted by the society last month, nearly 69 percent of the 1,006 respondents said they had a habit of reading physical books, down from 72.72 percent in 2023. 

The number of people who read ebooks remained constant at around 70 percent.

Edmund Chan, the director of City University of Hong Kong Press, told RTHK the findings showed a need to promote reading among residents. 

"In Hong Kong, it's a little bit lagging behind, in the sense that, if we're talking about students, then most students they spend time reading simply because they need to fulfill the requirement of the school or simply they don't have time," he said. 

"Youngsters, as always, they could acquire knowledge out of what they are required. So, it is a self-motivated reading habit that we are promoting, we are advocating." 

The society recommended the government establish additional reading rooms within libraries to create more reading spaces for residents. 

It also urged authorities to introduce "reading vouchers" that would allow youngsters to access their preferred books.

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said his administration would strive to focus on high-quality development, while calling on Hongkongers to stay flexible and chart their own paths in face of changes. 

His comments came a day after Beijing's top man on Hong Kong, Xia Baolong, told the opening ceremony of the National Security Education Day that the SAR should seek and embrace changes. 

Drawing on the speech by the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Lee said Xia was speaking to the whole of the territory. 

"The government should focus on high-quality development. We need to stay focused on the objective, we need to stay on course," he told reporters ahead of the weekly Exco meeting. 

"The commerce industry will have to invoke their innovative ideas. We need to find new growth areas. Different quarters in Hong Kong should work together for the betterment of Hong Kong, so that Hong Kong can once again shine." 

Lee pointed out that Hong Kong is now in a new phase of economic development, calling on people to "ride on the Lion Rock spirit". 

"Hong Kong people need to understand that the landscape has changed. They should take matters into their own hands and they should stay flexible and adaptive," he said. 

The chief executive added the SAR has to integrate into the nation's overall development, which offers Hong Kong the most direct and unlimited opportunities.]]>

    <![CDATA[The SAR government on Tuesday said it strongly disapproved of and rejected what it called “untruthful remarks, slanders and smears” against various aspects of the HKSAR in the UK's six-monthly report on Hong Kong.

A government spokesperson pointed out that the HKSAR is an inalienable part of China, and, as a local administrative region that enjoys a high degree of autonomy under the principle of “One Country, Two Systems”, comes directly under the jurisdiction of the Central People's Government. 

"The UK once again made skewed remarks about Hong Kong by replacing the rule of law with political manipulation and confounding right and wrong, and blatantly interfering in Hong Kong affairs which are entirely China's internal affairs," the spokesperson added.

The spokesperson reiterated that the SAR government resolutely safeguards national sovereignty, security and development interests, and fully and faithfully lives up to the highest principle of “One Country, Two Systems”. 

The SAR government urged the UK to immediately stop actions that are inconsistent with international law and basic norms of international relations, and to immediately stop interfering in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs, said the spokesperson.

The spokesperson pointed out that the content of the British report on Hong Kong's improved electoral system and last year's district council elections are completely untrue. He stressed that in Hong Kong, people of any background can participate in elections in accordance with the law as long as they meet the necessary requirements and are patriots.]]>

    <![CDATA[Penalties for failing to follow fire safety orders will be increased and the authorities will carry out work in private buildings themselves if owners don't rectify problems, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.

His comments follow a fire in Jordan last week that left five people dead, with officials saying the residential building involved had two ongoing non-compliance cases regarding fire safety – one of them dating back to 2008.

Before going into this week's Executive Council meeting, Lee said the authorities want to take swifter action in future to fix fire safety issues.

"There will be a legislative proposal to be made to Legco for the government to be empowered to actually carry out the necessary work to improve fire safety and fire installations, if the responsible person delayed for a long time, or when the hazard is of a type that we think we need to move in," he said.

"Also, we will be making a legislative proposal to increase the penalty for non-compliance with, for example, directions issued by the Buildings Department."

Lee said he believes the government could put forward a bill to Legco sometime this year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Officials on Monday urged people to refrain from bringing regulated food from mainland China and overseas into Hong Kong as this poses a food safety risk and violates the law.

In a joint press conference with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, the Customs and Excise Department noted there were 1,057 cases of importing regulated goods last year, a similar level to 2019. 

Officers said there were almost 400 such cases in the first three months of this year, adding that in most scenarios travellers brought fresh meat and eggs for personal use.

“We haven’t seen a tremendous increase in the smuggling trend or passengers bringing in regulated food. But we think there's a need for us to bring to the attention of the public, so that they are not going to bring in any regulated food in the upcoming Golden Week holidays,” Divisional Commander Tang Wai-pong said. 

He noted more people had been heading north to buy groceries from mainland supermarkets. 

“There's a chance that they think buying [regulated] food from the supermarkets will have less food safety issues. But it's still against the law,” he said. 

Tang said Customs would step up enforcement actions during May's Golden Week as more visitors are expected during that period.]]>

    'HK must fulfil national security tasks from Beijing'

    <![CDATA[The vice-chairman of the Basic Law Committee, Zhang Yong, on Monday said the SAR must implement national security "tasks and measures" set out by the central authorities. 

He also told a panel discussion on National Security Education Day that safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests is the highest principle of the "One Country, Two Systems" policy. 

"Local governments, administrative regions and their administrations, including the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions, must safeguard the authority of the central government, follow national security strategies and policies, and implement the tasks and measures set out by the central authorities on safeguarding national security," Zhang said. 

Addressing the same gathering, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam said the city's national security laws and its development go hand in hand.  

"Before the legislation was enacted, Hong Kong was like a vehicle with one of its tyres not fully inflated or a bird with one of its wings not fully developed. It is inevitable that the car won't go smoothly, and the bird will not be able to fly high and far," Lam said. 

Former director of public prosecutions Grenville Cross, for his part, accused the West of hypocrisy for criticising the territory's security legislation, saying there are tougher laws in other places such as Singapore. 

"As Western politicians are keen not to offend Singapore, they disregard national security arrangements they would have decried had they arisen in Hong Kong. Insincerity apart, the only possible explanation for this is they want to needle China and besmirch its global status, even if they harm Hong Kong's standing in the process," Cross said. 

Betty Yuen, who chairs the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said the new domestic national security law helps the SAR maintain a stable business environment in the face of a complex geopolitical situation and an uncertain global economic situation.]]>

    <![CDATA[The head of Beijing's Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong on Monday said national security is the SAR's top priority and ongoing effort is needed to maintain social stability. 

Dong Jingwei told an opening ceremony for National Security Education Day that Hong Kong is highly open and susceptible to external threats, and its destiny is closely tied to that of the country. 

"During critical times of reform, it's more important than ever to unite. During key phases of development, our national security becomes even more important. Maintaining social stability and national security in Hong Kong isn't a one and done process," he said.

Meanwhile, Li Yongsheng, deputy commissioner of the Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong, said he believes the city will thrive with the strong support of the nation. 

"We firmly believe that with the strong backing of the great motherland, Hong Kong will be able to achieve higher quality development and higher level of openness under a higher level of security and speed up the beautiful process from stability to prosperity," he said. 

Wang Zhaobing, deputy political commissar of the People's Liberation Army in the SAR, said the Hong Kong garrison will strengthen military training to safeguard national sovereignty and the long-term prosperity of the territory.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Monday said the enactment of legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law gave Hong Kong strong protection against threats to national security.  

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the National Security Education Day, Lee warned the SAR must remain vigilant.

"The threat of an attack from hostile forces will continue. Like a virus, it doesn't stop just because we've been vaccinated. The virus won't disappear automatically," said Lee, who also chairs the Committee on Safeguarding National Security. 

"Similarly, even after the implementation of national security laws, activities that endanger national security will continue to attack us like viruses. So, we cannot forget about the pain after the wounds have healed."

The CE set out four ways in which his administration would protect national security, including explaining the national security laws, strengthening internal systems, preventing and punishing illegal acts, and enhancing education.   

Meanwhile, the director of the Liaison Office, Zheng Yanxiong, said Hong Kong could focus on developing the economy with national security laws in place. 
 
"’One Country, Two Systems’ will remain unchanged for a long time and has become a broad social consensus. The common law system is still effective, the three major centres are still significant, horse racing and stock trading are still vibrant, and the Pearl of the Orient remains romantic," he said. 

Zheng added Hongkongers should unite to guard against external forces who spread rumours and create a better future for the SAR.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Deputy Consul General at the French Consulate in Hong Kong and Macau, Marc Lamy, said preparations for the Paris Olympics are in full swing, with enhanced security measures and efficient transportation arrangements in place for the international sporting event.

With the opening ceremony set for July 26, Lamy said France is dedicated to ensuring maximum security, adding their previous experience in hosting large events has helped with their preparations.

"There will be more than more than 56,000 security personnel, including policemen, gendarmerie, including also private guards that will make sure that the security in the transportation, in the streets, on the sites, and around the sites will be completely and fully ensured," he said.

"The country and the government are completely committed for full security so people can really enjoy their time in France and be happy and discover not only the performances of the athletes, but have a good time when they are outside in the street and discover our beautiful cities and our beautiful Paris."

Lamy added France is committed to organising a sustainable and green games. 

"All the infrastructure, like the village for the athletes that will be built, after use it will become housing for the students and all the things like this," he said. 

"So [organisers have] been also very careful about how much money we spend to make sure and to reduce the carbon footprint during the games."]]>
