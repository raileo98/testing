    <![CDATA[Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak on Saturday said 12 care teams have been deployed to Sai Kung in response to the severe rainfall that hit the area.  

At one point, the Observatory recorded over 200 millimetres of rain in the district, causing significant flooding on several roads, including Po Lam Road North and Wan Po Road in Tseung Kwan O, as well as Pak Sha Wan Street in Sai Kung. 

The home affairs minister said some care team members were already on duty in temporary shelters while others were checking the district for floods and reporting to the Sai Kung district officer. 

She also dismissed claims that some care team members didn't turn up when the rain was at its hardest on Saturday morning.

“Care team members are volunteers and they are fully dedicated to their work. However, during periods of heavy rainfall and when there are floods, the responsibility for addressing standing water and flooding falls to the government's professional departments,” she said. “I think the general public don’t expect care teams to deal with the floods without the necessary equipment.”

She added that most floods in the district had been dealt with before noon and most roads affected had been reopened by 2 pm. 

She said the Home Affairs Department had opened nine temporary shelters across Hong Kong for people in need of temporary accommodation.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled the amber rainstorm warning signal at 8.45pm on Saturday. 

It said heavy rain over Hong Kong had started to ease. The Observatory had issued the amber signal to replace the red rainstorm warning just before 4pm.

However, the forecaster has also warned that another intense band of thundery showers is edging towards the Pearl River Estuary, and this might still affect Hong Kong. 

The red signal had been in place since about 9 am and, at around noon, the Observatory warned it might issue its maximum black signal as even heavier rain started to fall across Hong Kong, especially in the east. 

Meanwhile, the Drainage Services Department said it mobilised about 70 emergency response teams to handle flooding, involving over 160 emergency response teams comprising about 600 people. It said that by 7.30pm, all 16 flooding cases, including 12 in the Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O areas, had been resolved. 

The Geotechnical Engineering Office said it received 15 reports of landslides in the Sai Kung area. 

The Fire Services Department said that as of 7pm it had handled 25 reports of people trapped in lifts, and 71 reports from automatic fire alarm systems. It said fourteen people were evacuated.

The government said it received 22 reports of fallen trees with no injuries as of 8pm.

The Home Affairs Department said it had opened nine temporary shelters located in Southern District on Hong Kong Island, Yau Tsim Mong and Kowloon City in Kowloon, and Tseung Kwan O and Sai Kung in the New Territories.

    <![CDATA[Police on Saturday rescued two groups of hikers near Sai Kung, as heavy rain fell over Hong Kong, particularly in the east.

Officers said a group of 11 mainland tourists, including seven children, contacted police at about 11.30 am, after finding themselves stranded at High Island Reservoir East Dam. They had previously been camping in the area. 

At about the same time, rescuers were also called in by four local hikers who found themselves in difficulty on section two of the MacLehose Trail. 

The force said they were able to locate all of the stranded hikers, and evacuate them, adding that none of the 15 were injured and that they didn't require hospital treatment.

The Observatory issued the first Red Rainstorm Signal of the year just before 9 am, before saying it was considering issuing the higher Black Rainstorm Signal at around noon.

At 10.30 am, the forecaster also issued a Landslip Warning, reminding people to stay away from steep slopes, and to stay at home.]]>

    <![CDATA[Dozens of cars were damaged by flood water at a car park in Tseung Kwan O on Saturday, as heavy rain continued to fall over Hong Kong, leading the Observatory to consider issuing a Black Rainstorm Warning.

“For that particular outdoor car park area, there are around 450 cars. I think half of the cars were seriously [flooded]," said district councillor Christine Fong in an interview with RTHK. "Some of them, the water was up over the tyres, even up to the engine."

Fong also said the car park, on Wan Po Road in Lohas Park, didn't have a reputation for flooding so many drivers had been caught out. 

The Observatory said the east of the SAR had borne the brunt of the rainfall with over 200 millimetres of rain falling in Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O.

Road flooding in those two areas also meant that only limited services could be provided at two out-patient clinics there.

Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Department says it has opened temporary shelters for people in need of temporary accommodation.

Earlier, the Observatory had issued the Red Rainstorm Signal just before 9 am following a night of rain, leading to the suspension of classes at all schools.]]>

    New minimum wage formula to protect labour: Sun

    <![CDATA[The Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Saturday said the new minimum wage formula will provide support to Hong Kong's 17,000 low income workers, who currently earn an hourly rate of HK$40.

The new formula - which bars any reduction - takes effect next year, after being given the go-ahead on Tuesday by the Chief Executive, John Lee, and the Executive Council.

Speaking to reporters after appearing on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun said the reform balanced the interests of both labour and employers.

"It has taken into account, on the one hand, the need to protect those earning a minimum wage, that their wage is being protected; and also, at the same time, to ensure that the formula is affordable, and also acceptable to the business sector," Sun said.

Earlier the labour minister told an RTHK radio programme that the government would enhance safety awareness following the deaths of two sewer maintenance workers, who are believed to have been exposed to toxic gas in a manhole last week in Sha Tin. 

Sun stated that new guidelines for those working in confined spaces, to be announced this month, will make it mandatory to install CCTV at the entrance and exit of manholes.]]>

    <![CDATA[Catering sector representative Simon Wong on Saturday said restaurants saw 10 percent less business than usual this May 1 public holiday, which was also the first day of the mainland's Golden Week break. 

Speaking to reporters after appearing on a radio programme, the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades president said this was partially due to 20,000 fewer mainland arrivals on that day, although the May 1 firework display had helped trade near Victoria Harbour.

“We see that business in some areas in Hong Kong - like in Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, and along the harbour - because of the fireworks, recorded some increase," he said. "I did visit several districts in Hong Kong and saw that there were not too many people visiting shopping malls.”

Wong added that reduced spending power among individual travellers and the bad weather during the week contributed to the lower sales. He also attributed the lower sales to many locals heading north.

Meanwhile, a hotel group says the occupancy rate for its two hotels also dropped about six to seven percent when compared to last year.

Alan Chan, the operations officer of Miramar Group, said the group had offered substantial price discounts to retain hotel guests, with prices per night decreasing by approximately 23 percent year-on-year.

“For the hotel industry, if we need to drop prices by 23 percent to retain a certain occupancy rate, I think it’s not really ideal,” he said

He said that this year, many mainland flights had resumed to other countries, and visa requirements had also been relaxed for mainlanders, giving them more travel options.

Chan urged the government to liaise with mainland authorities to further expand the Individual Visit Scheme so more mainlanders could visit the SAR.

The five-day mainland holiday will conclude on Sunday.

According to the Immigration Department, arrivals on May 1 reached 460,000, with over 180,000 coming from the mainland.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Observatory on Saturday said it may issue the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, as heavy rain continues to batter Hong Kong, particularly in the east of the territory. It had issued the Red Rainstorm Signal just before 9 am, as the rainy weather that has hit Hong Kong over the past few days worsened. 

Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O have seen very heavy rain with the Observatory saying more than 200 millimetres have been recorded and that severe rainstorms would continue to affect the eastern part of the SAR. It also warned people to stay away from watercourses across the territory due to the possibility of flash floods.

Meanwhile, a Hospital Authority spokesman for the Kowloon East Cluster said road flooding meant only limited services could be provided at the Mona Fong General Out-patient Clinic in Sai Kung and the Tseung Kwan O Jockey Club General Out-patient Clinic.

Earlier, the government had called on the public to report flooding to the Drainage Services Department following wet weather overnight. There have been reports of flooding and a fallen tree in Chai Wan, and flooding on Silver Cape Road in Tseung Kwan O.

Schools have also been told to make sure conditions are safe before allowing students to leave, while all classes have been suspended for the afternoon

The government has also told employers to make arrangements for staff.

    <![CDATA[The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, says that the government is taking steps to enhance Hong Kong's attractiveness as a wealth management and capital formation centre in order to consolidate the city's position as a leading global financial centre. 

In an interview on RTHK's Your Home Address programme, he noted that one of the key measures introduced was the Capital Entrant Admission Scheme, which allows individuals with capital of more than HK$30 million to become permanent residents after residing in in Hong Kong for seven years. This scheme has received a positive response, he said. 

He discussed efforts to facilitate capital formation, including the reduction of stamp duty for the stock market and the reform of the Growth Enterprise Board, which focuses mainly on small and medium-sized enterprises.

"Hong Kong has a very competitive edge as the equity and also bond raising platform for different corporates. So in that context, we have a number of measures laid out and actually implemented phase by phase to enhance the appeal of our capital market," he said. 

Hui stressed that amid global geopolitical changes, people are looking for ways to diversify their assets, adding that Hong Kong can seize the opportunities arising from these challenges. 

He said the city is a very attractive option for individuals to invest their capital and channel investments through Hong Kong to the mainland. 

He said the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a wealth management and capital formation centre was evident with more than 2,700 single-family offices already established in the city.]]>

    HA sponsors new round of overseas podiatry training

    <![CDATA[The Hospital Authority (HA) is launching a new round of its overseas training sponsorship programme, fully subsidising eligible participants to earn a bachelor's degree in podiatry at the University of Northampton in the UK.

The scheme to send people abroad for training on foot treatment was first introduced in 2005 due to the lack of recognised programmes among local tertiary institutions.

Stanley Wan, who works as a resident podiatrist at Yan Chai Hospital, participated in the programme in 2014 and joined the HA in 2017. 

He had graduated with an engineering degree, but decided to switch to a new career. 

“In terms of my profile, I think I'm not really as good as other competitors, which could possibly already have a degree related to chemistry or bio-engineering,” he said.

“But I think I showed the interviewer that I have great determination of preparing myself. I applied for the course of physiology, trying to learn something that I probably [did not] know before. 

"Also I participated in my church activities, which mainly serve the elderly.”

Two or three places are on offer each year, and successful applicants must commit to working for the HA for at least five years upon graduation.

Priscilla Poon, the HA's chief manager of allied health, said applicants actually find the requirement attractive because Hong Kong doesn't have its own podiatry registration process.

“I think it's a kind of encouragement to them… For those graduates who have graduated in the UK – despite the fact that they are able to register in the UK – [but because] there’s no registration in Hong Kong, there won't be any guarantee of job opportunities,” she said.

“But if we ask them to serve in HA at least for five years, I think that will be a very positive message for them… they're still able to get a very good pay and a very good job opportunity in HA.” 

Poon said the HA currently employs 54 podiatrists, but lost about 5 percent of staff each year in recent years due to retirement or resignations.

She added that while the current staff level is sufficient, Hong Kong's ageing population is expected to increase the demand for podiatrists further.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Companies Registry on Friday said the personal information of around 110,000 people had been leaked due to a fault in its digital platform.

The registry said if people conduct searches on its e-Services Portal and pressed the F12 key, they might see additional personal details.

Information being exposed included names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, as well as full identity and passport numbers.

The body said urgent maintenance has been carried out to prevent further leaks, and that it is getting in touch with and apologising to those affected.

It added that it is consulting the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer with a view to conducting a comprehensive review of the incident and taking further enhancement measures to safeguard personal data.

The privacy watchdog, for its part, said it is launching a probe given the number of people affected in the incident.

Earlier, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department apologised after information of around 17,000 public housing tenants required to undergo Covid tests in 2022 was exposed online.]]>

    <![CDATA[A government-commissioned study has found that teenagers who took part in its mentorship scheme found the programme beneficial – having improved their financial planning skills, confidence and sense of belonging.

Polytechnic University researchers spoke to around 2,600 grassroots teenagers, who joined the first phase of the Strive and Rise programme that paired them with mentors. 

The junior secondary students on average gave themselves a score of 4.22 out of 6 on financial planning after completing the year-long programme late last year – 12 percent higher than before they joined the scheme.

The survey also showed the teenagers describing themselves as becoming more confident, feeling a greater sense of belonging, as well as developing stronger interpersonal skills.

At a press conference summing up the first phase of the programme, one of the participants, Li Ching-po, said he learnt how to make small talk when meeting someone new.

He added that he had used the HK$10,000 allowance provided by the programme to pay for his violin lessons.

"With the support and encouragement from my mentors, I found my dream of becoming a great violin teacher," he said. "I hope I'll become an accomplished violinist and fulfil my dream."

Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who had been overseeing the programme, said he was happy to see the participants' growth.

He brushed aside criticism that some teenagers did not get to see their mentors often.

"We know that not every mentor has a lot of free time on their hands. [But] they signed up on their own, and I believe they wanted to do this and knew they had to devote some of their time. Our records show that the mentors and participants met 12 times a year on average," Chan said.

"I can say that most of our mentors were very responsible."

The minister said the government wants to keep the scheme running, and serve a total of 12,000 participants by the year 2025-2026.]]>

    Sha Tin trunk road plan gets Legco green light

   <description>
    <![CDATA[The Legislative Council’s Finance Committee on Friday approved a funding request for a controversial HK$6.8 billion plan to build a new trunk road in Sha Tin to relieve traffic in the area. 

Sixty-one lawmakers voted in favour of the plan and three voted against, with 12 abstentions after a four-hour meeting. 

The estimated cost of the “Trunk Road T4” project was lowered by around five percent from the original HK$7.1 billion after concerns were raised over its hefty price tag. 

The plan is to build a dual two-lane trunk road of around 2.3 kilometres and connect major roads on both sides of the Shing Mun River.

Transport minister Lam Sai-hung told the Legco meeting that the trunk road is needed to cope with the growing population in New Territories East.

“The population of New Territories East is expected to increase further. Trunk Road T4 is therefore important in the context of the overall transport infrastructure planning and also serves a regional function," he said. 

"And it is anticipated that the major roads network in New Territories East will gradually not be able to meet the transport and logistics needs in the short-to-medium term."

However, a number of legislators, including Peter Koon from the Election Committee, questioned whether the plan is needed or is worth the money.

“When we have monetary resources, of course it'd be okay. However, when the government budget is in the red, when we need to solve traffic congestion problems in peak hours, can we really solve the problem? If we need to resolve the bottleneck in Sha Tin and you're simply moving the bottleneck to elsewhere, other areas will still be affected,” he said. 

Lawmaker Connie Lam, who represents the New Territories South East, also had reservations about the plan. 
 
“This T4 road actually is a bit out of budget and it's not a suitable time to build. We have to strike a balance between how to control the expenditure of the government and the needs of the residents there,” she said. 

Officials said they’ve already scrapped a proposed elevated cycling track across Shing Mun River, and reduced the number of elevators at footbridges to minimise costs.]]>

    <![CDATA[Education minister Christine Choi on Friday said students taking Chinese History in the DSE exams will be allowed to skip part of the test from 2026.

Under the new arrangement, pupils can choose to take only a compulsory test that covers Chinese historical events ranging from the ancient Xia dynasty onwards, or they can also sit a paper that focuses on the political, religious, social and other aspects of different periods.

Students only sitting the compulsory paper will be able to get a grade 5 at most, while those who sit the two papers can get up to 5**.

The Education Bureau said students will not need to disclose to the exam authority if they are skipping a test, so they will not be labelled.

It said it has not consulted the sector extensively on the move because the syllabus and assessment method are not being changed.

Choi said they want to give students more choice.

"We hope to allow more students who are interested to take Chinese history, or let students study the subject according to their ability," she told reporters.

"Of course teachers will need to think about how to allocate lesson time and take care of students of different ability levels. I believe this won't be difficult as we implement the change and teachers become experienced."

Teachers will need to have a teaching plan ready when the new academic year starts in September for form five students who plan to only take the mandatory test.

Ho Hon-kuen who heads Education Convergence, a body consisting of teachers and principals, said it will not be hard to cater to two groups of students.

"Some of the students can study in the library while others spend more time in the classroom. Or, if the teachers and principals are more dedicated, they can break the students into two groups and teach them separately," he told RTHK.

But Lee Wai-hung, a senior Chinese history teacher at Fukien Secondary School (Siu Sai Wan), said it may be difficult to split students into two groups when there are not many taking the subject.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Observatory on Friday said Hong Kong has just experienced the warmest April on record, with the hottest day reaching almost 32 degrees Celsius.  

The monthly mean temperature was 26.4 degrees – 3.4 degrees higher than usual.

The observatory said the hot weather was down to a warmer than normal sea surface temperature and unusually strong southerly air flows over the northern part of the South China Sea.

“Affected by an anticyclone aloft and the subsequent southerly airstream, it was generally fine and hot during the day from April 11 to 17. With plenty of sunshine, the temperatures at the observatory rose to a maximum of 31.9 degrees on the afternoon of April 13, the highest of the month,” it said. 

The forecaster added that the SAR was also a lot wetter than usual last month, with total rainfall of 257.1 millimetres – almost 70 percent more than usual.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Friday said less than half of households participating in a trial run of a pay-as-you-throw scheme have been using the designated bags for rubbish disposal.

It said between 20 and 50 percent of households have been making use of the bags since they were given them last month, with the rate even lower in buildings that aren't run by management companies. 

However, the department said most of the care homes, restaurants and government buildings taking part in the trial scheme have adopted the designated bags.

Authorities said they are aware that some businesses have seen their operational costs rise due to using the bags and officials will report these concerns to lawmakers on May 27.]]>

    <![CDATA[The data of around 17,000 people who were required to undergo Covid tests at the peak of the pandemic has been exposed online, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) has warned. 

In a statement issued late on Thursday, the department said names, phone numbers, identity card numbers and addresses of residents were collected during lockdown operations between March and July in 2022.  

The information was stored on an online server accessible to authorised staff using a password. 

But on April 30 this year, EMSD was told by the city's privacy watchdog that some information was accessible without the need for a password.

Residents of 14 public housing blocks are affected including those living in Yan Ching House of Kai Ching Estate in Kai Tak, Oi Ming House of Yau Oi Estate in Tuen Mun and Fu Leung House of Fu Cheong Estate in Sham Shui Po. 

The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data said it will launch an investigation but has not received any complaints so far. 

"We think the situation is serious. We will initiate an investigation according to our normal procedures. We also suggest that the relevant department inform the affected individuals as soon as possible, given the relatively large number of people impacted," Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung told an RTHK programme. 

EMSD apologised for the incident, adding that it will notify the households affected by mail and "there is no evidence that relevant data has been published so far".
 
The matter has been reported to the police, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and the Security Bureau.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police on Thursday said they believe a suspected burglar, who died after being found unconscious at Lantau's Sea Ranch, had fallen from height. 

Officers said the mainland man, who's 37, crossed the border on a two-way permit on Tuesday. 

They suspect he was part of a gang of three burgling homes at the isolated resort.

Residents from five homes reported that their place had been broken into, with HK$7,000 and some cigarettes missing. 

Police said two of the suspects had returned to the mainland on Wednesday, and they would seek help from their mainland counterparts if needed.

Officers said they found a trail of blood from one of the blocks at the resort, adding the deceased had a blow to his head, with his jaw and teeth broken.

An autopsy would be conducted to establish the cause of death.

Officers added they had received four reports of burglary at Sea Ranch since last December, and investigations were ongoing. No arrests have been made over those cases so far.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Thursday said it had started criminal proceedings against hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its founder, director and chief investment officer Simon Sadler, and former trader Daniel La Rocca for the offence of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company prior to a block trade in June 2017.

In a statement, the SFC said the two defendants appeared at Eastern Magistrates' Court on Thursday and the case was adjourned to June 12.

Sadler, a British businessman, is also the owner of Blackpool Football Club which competes in England's EFL League One division.

Established in 2007, Segantii is one of the oldest and biggest hedge funds in Asia. 

Apart from Hong Kong, it also has operations in London, New York and Dubai, according to its website.

In a statement on its website, Blackpool Football Club said the charges were entirely unrelated to the club, and its day-to-day operations would not be affected.

"We understand that Mr Sadler will vigorously defend himself against the charge, and there will be no further comments at the time from the Club," the statement added. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

    <![CDATA[Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) is launching a series of new programmes from May, covering topics from news and current affairs to youth, family, and community activities, as well as education and culture.

The new programmes will be broadcast across RTHK's eight channels.

Speaking at the launch ceremony on Thursday, RTHK’s assistant director, Vincent Lee, said RTHK is committed to innovative production, nurturing new talent, and recruiting skilled individuals. 

He noted that over 80 new employees joined the public broadcaster following multiple rounds of civil service recruitment conducted in recent months. 

Lee added that pure audio content was no longer sufficient to meet the needs of the public and the broadcaster would utilise more advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to visualise radio programmes and distribute content across different platforms to reach a wider audience.

Meanwhile, he said RTHK’s productions would deepen its connection with the mainland to tell good stories of Hong Kong and China - as 2024 marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

RTHK would also provide comprehensive coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics, as well as the 2025 National Games, through television, radio, and new media platforms, Lee added.

RTHK's director of broadcasting Eddie Cheung, vice chairman of the Board of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority Bernard Chan and chairman of RTHK Board of Advisors Lam Tai-fai also attended the ceremony.]]>
