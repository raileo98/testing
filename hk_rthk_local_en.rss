    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Observatory warned on Tuesday evening that hail could affect the SAR after it was reported in the Pearl River Delta. 

Hail was reported in Macau as authorities there called on residents to stay indoors.

In Hong Kong, the amber rainstorm warning was issued at 9:30pm.

The forecaster called on people to be alert and seek safe shelter, as violent gusts reaching 110 kilometres per hour affect the territory. 

The Labour Department called on employers to avoid assigning workers to carry out electrical work, and protect the safety of those engaged in such tasks.

"Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by the rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent electric shock as the air would be more humid," said a spokesperson from the department.]]>

    <![CDATA[The number of negative equity cases reached a 20-year high in the first quarter, figures released by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) showed.

According to the HKMA, there were 32,073 cases at the end of March, up 27 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 and the most since the first quarter of 2004.

The HKMA noted that the loans had mainly been taken out by bank staff or linked to mortgage insurance, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio.

Government figures out last week showed home prices rebounded in March, snapping a 10-month losing streak. That's after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech on February 28.]]>

    'New changes to minimum wage fair for businesses'

    <![CDATA[A lawmaker and a representative of small and medium-sized firms on Tuesday welcomed the new way of calculating Hong Kong's minimum wage, which now takes into account the city's economic development and consumer prices.

Danny Lau, the honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said the shake-up is fair for business operators and workers, but it is unreasonable there is no chance of the minimum wage being reduced if times get tough for businesses.

"The only thing that we worry is you can only [increase it], you cannot decrease the minimum wage," he said.  

Under the new changes, the minimum wage would not be reduced but frozen even if the formula produces a negative number. 

Asked if it would put pressure on bosses in small and medium-sized firms when the economy is not doing well, Priscilla Wong, who chairs the Minimum Wage Commission, said a balance needs to be struck.  

“These are the people with the lowest ability to bargain, the least bargaining power. And as a society, we are hoping that their wages do not go through vertically down and go down to the point that we lose our wage floor,” she told a media briefing. 

Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing welcomed the new mechanism, but he told RTHK the administration should give greater weight to GDP in the calculations.

"We hope the proportion that [accounts for] the growth in GDP can be more. This means if we have a large growth of the GDP and then we can have an increase in minimum wages level, that's very important because it allows our grassroots workers to share the fruit of economic development," he said.

Liberal Party's catering sector lawmaker, Tommy Cheung, earlier said the minimum wage could hurt the SAR's competitiveness, calling on authorities to scrap it altogether. 

But labour minister Chris Sun dismissed the suggestion, saying the new changes ensure there is room for low-paid workers to maintain their purchasing power. 

“The design of the formula is to make sure that while we remain competitive, we have to also take care of the needs of those at the very low level. We're just talking about a small number of workers. And as a society, we should help them to make sure that at the very low level, we have enough room for them to be able to earn.”]]>

    HK to adopt new way of calculating minimum wage

    <![CDATA[The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a shake-up of the way Hong Kong's minimum wage is decided, with the wage floor to be reviewed every year in future instead of every two. 

Calculations will include the SAR's economic growth rate in the previous year, as well as consumer prices. 

There'll be no chance of the minimum wage being reduced regardless of what the figures suggest, with any negative calculation leading to a freeze instead. 

The government said it is making the changes based on recommendations from the Minimum Wage Commission, which consulted labour and employer groups as well as academics on the matter last year.

The first minimum wage under the new mechanism will be set in two years' time.

"The recommendations of the [commission] have struck an appropriate balance between the objectives of forestalling excessively low wages and minimising the loss of low-paid jobs, while giving due regard to sustaining Hong Kong's economic growth and competitiveness," said Labour Secretary Chris Sun.

Hong Kong's minimum wage is currently set at HK$40 per hour. The Minimum Wage Commission is to submit a report by the end of October on its recommendations for any change.]]>

    <![CDATA[Health officials on Tuesday warned that an extended flu season would continue for some time, with more outbreaks and serious cases. 

The Centre for Health Protection urged the public to remain vigilant as Hong Kong has seen a rise in flu infections, with more than 500 adults suffering serious complications or dying since January. Most of them are over 65 or have chronic illnesses.

There have been 22 severe flu cases among children, including three deaths. 

Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, from the Centre for Health Protection, said health authorities were closely monitoring the situation. 

"The predominant flu strain has shifted from H3 to H1, resulting in another wave of infections. We expect this wave to continue for a few weeks, but it's difficult to say exactly how long," she said. 

"We are closely monitoring other regions of the world, as Hong Kong residents travel a lot. Influenza B is still circulating in some parts outside Hong Kong, so we cannot rule out the possibility of a further change in the flu strain."

Health authorities urged the public to seek medical attention if they experience flu-like symptoms.]]>

    Movie lovers say farewell to President Cinema

    <![CDATA[Scores of movie lovers on Tuesday bade farewell to President Cinema in Causeway Bay, bringing the curtain down on almost six decades of showing films. 

Its operator, Newport Circuit, had announced last week that the theatre on Jaffe Road was closing after Tuesday, though it did not say why.

Still, Newport Circuit thanked customers for their support throughout the years.

While some people were just there to snap pictures, others bought tickets for the final shows at the theatre that first opened in 1966.

Leo, an actor, said it was a pity that a platform which showcased cinematic productions was disappearing.

"I've been here one or two times many years ago," he said. "I don't care if it's old or if the seat is good or bad, I just want to [catch a film] for the last time in this cinema."

Another movie-goer, Alice, said she was watching a film at the cinema for the first time.

"This kind of old cinema is very rare. They disappear when the industry is on decline and not many people are buying tickets, so I think if I have the chance to sit down and watch a movie [here] once, I'd like to go," she said.

A regular customer, meanwhile, said the cinema brought back a lot of memories for her, from the days when people could still buy grilled squid before going into the theatre.

"There's nothing we can do. Now everyone watches movies at home," she said.

Last week, a Golden Harvest cinema in Kai Tak also closed down, following the end of its tenancy contract.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police on Tuesday said they have arrested and charged a man and were searching for another over a crane collapse that killed three workers at a construction site in 2022. 

Officers announced the arrest of a 35-year-old former project manager with the main contractor involved in the building construction in Sau Mau Ping.

He has been charged with manslaughter and will appear in Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on Thursday.

Meanwhile, a warrant was issued for a 72-year-old structural engineer. 

Aggressive Construction Company, the contractor for the site on Anderson Road, confirmed earlier that a former employee had been arrested. 

The company added that it is being prosecuted over the crane collapse.

    <![CDATA[Scholars on Tuesday called on the government to offer more support for people who look after children or elderly relatives while living in subdivided housing.

In a survey conducted by Lingnan University and Chinese University, 95 percent of the 315 caregivers surveyed, who live in subdivided homes, were found to be stressed out, while 20.5 percent of respondents exhibited signs of depression. 

Speaking at a press conference, Ruby Lai from Lingnan University's Department of Sociology and Social Policy said caregivers had been struggling with stress from the unsuitable living conditions, expensive rents and excessive workloads. 

"What we see is that there are many spatial constraints at home, like there's no separations of kitchen and toilet, or there's no independent cooking place, so that they have to set up a makeshift cooking space for them to cook every time and then to pack up all the things to leave this space for their children to do homework," she explained.

Lai called on the government to ensure better quality of life for caregivers living in such conditions. 

She also called on authorities to roll out cash subsidies to relieve the stress faced by caregivers in subdivided housing, and strengthen community support.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said there's plenty for tourists to do in Hong Kong during the Labour Day Golden Week holiday, even if Wednesday night's pyrotechnic display might be cancelled due to weather. 

Authorities had warned that the 10-minute show at Victoria Harbour on May 1 could be called off if rain and thunderstorms happen as predicted. A decision would be made on Wednesday afternoon.

The display is scheduled to be the first in a series of occasions marking the city’s mega events and festivals.

Lee also said weather would not affect other events during the national holiday this week.

"We want to do the best to ensure that [the show] will be most welcome and enjoyed by everybody, tourists and Hong Kong people. But of course, the weather is always unpredictable," he said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.

"There are a wide range of activities that have been arranged to welcome visitors during Golden Week."]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said people are getting to grips with a ban on single-use plastic utensils, a week after it took effect.

Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, he said there are signs of people steadily changing their habits, citing a media report that said two-thirds of people are no longer taking plastic utensils in restaurants.

On complaints from some people that alternative cutlery products are of low quality, Lee said he thinks suppliers and restaurants will get better.

"Of course during the process there's always room for us to make improvements. For restaurant operators and alternative [utensil] suppliers, I believe [they] will continue to improve their work and they will continue to supply different types of alternatives to disposable tableware," he said.

The CE added that Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan will continue to explain the new policy, after questions arose as to whether plastic containers can be used for takeaway food.

Lee said authorities will keep an eye on the way people adapt to the initial phase of the ban, as well as the supply of substitute products, before deciding what to do next.

While restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils like straws and cutlery, the government had earlier said that plastic containers and cups – which are still allowed for takeaways at the moment – will be banned completely in the next phase.]]>

    <![CDATA[A paediatrician said on Tuesday that Hong Kong's flu season is running longer than normal this year, with cases still increasing rather than tapering off as expected. 

Dr Mike Kwan from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that the extended flu season reflected a global phenomenon, with people's immunity against viruses falling when measures were imposed during the Covid pandemic.

He says Hong Kong now faces what he called a tridemic, with people threatened by flu, Covid and another respiratory infection, RSV respiratory syncytial virus, as well as other conditions.

Asked when the flu season would conclude, he told RTHK's Janice Wong: "We cannot make a prediction yet because the number is still rising and we are still seeing so many of the severe cases. Unfortunately, we hear about the news of another fatal case yesterday. This is very sad.

"So I cannot make a prediction at this moment, but I just hope that the citizens can just go and have the flu vaccine if they have not yet received the vaccine."

Kwan said acceptance of the flu vaccine remained relatively low in Hong Kong. He also suggested people wear masks in crowded areas, use proper hygiene and stay home if they have the flu.]]>

    <![CDATA[The founder of an NGO said on Tuesday that many Hong Kong social workers are experiencing burnout as they face a range of challenges, including an increasing workload as more people in society face difficulty with their mental health.

Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme,  Chou Wah-shan from the mental health group Dreams Possible said a survey conducted with University of Hong Kong academics found that 93 percent of the 255 social workers interviewed experienced a moderate level of work-related stress. 

He said the study also found signs of depression in 68 percent of the interviewees.

"The issue of burning out is becoming more and more alarming," he told RTHK's Samantha Butler. "Because I think in the past couple of years, Hong Kong has been facing huge challlenges in many aspects: socio-economic, political.

"Also, many people are feeling frustrated and are having emotional and mental illness issues. That's why the workload of social workers, as the helping profession, has immensely increased, together with the intensity of clients' emotional issues, including emotional issues, depression, anxiety disorder or even suicidal issues."]]>

    Inquest experts differ over patient's liver failure

    <![CDATA[A transplant surgeon has stressed that a second organ transplant for a liver disease patient was the only way to keep her alive, as the Coroner’s Court heard conflicting explanations as to why the patient developed acute hepatic failure before her death.

Tang Kwai-sze, a hepatitis B carrier, underwent two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017 and died in August that same year at the age of 44.  

Two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.

Henry Pleass, a transplant surgeon in Australia, said it was unfortunate that medical practitioners did not give Tang medication needed along with the steroids she was taking.

“It’s our modern system with many other doctors looking after one individual. There’s no continuation,” he told the inquest's five-person jury and coroner Monica Chow. 

“We made the assumption that people have thought about the issue, and thought about the risks.”

Tang had experienced medical issues after the first transplant and Pleass said while doctors could have treated her conservatively, the surgery for a new organ gave her a chance of survival. 

On the cause of Tang’s liver failure, Pleass said it was “absolutely” because of a hepatitis B flare-up, ruling out the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis as suggested by another expert witness. 

Earlier, histopathologist Wilson Tsui said it was more likely that Tang suffered from autoimmune hepatitis.

Tsui said the high count of plasma cells and the absence of serologic markers, which are used to identify antibodies formed following an infection, indicated that a hepatitis B flare-up was less likely to have been the case. 

“To differentiate between a reactivation of hepatitis B and autoimmune hepatitis, [the count of plasma cells] is a relatively important index,” he said. 

But James Fung, an expert witness called to give evidence again after Tsui’s testimony, said the majority of patients with an acute hepatitis flare-up would still test negative for such serological markers. 

Fung, a transplant hepatologist at Queen Mary Hospital, also noted that while a higher count of plasma cells is commonly associated with autoimmune hepatitis, there could be exceptions.  

“Especially with very severe acute flares of hepatitis B, [plasma] cells themselves are often seen in these severe cases,” he said. 

The hearing continues.]]>

    Govt to adopt new heatstroke rules for outdoor workers

    <![CDATA[Labour officials on Monday said they were updating guidelines on when outdoor workers would be advised to stop working when it's very hot. 

This would enable the department’s heat stress warning system to be in line with the observatory's warnings about hot weather.

The observatory’s "extremely hot special alert" is issued when it's generally 35 degree Celcius and above. 

Some environmental and workers' groups had called for such a linkage between the two alert systems last year when the department’s guidelines were introduced. 

The Labour Department said the updated guidelines would apply next month. 

The guidelines also set out the varying lengths of breaks workers should be given every hour when the heat stress warnings are in effect.

The new rules state that if employers adopt a certain amount of measures to prevent heatstroke - such as reducing workload, providing shades and using mist fans to improve ventilation - they can completely cut the hourly breaks for workers.

If insufficient measures were adopted, the guidelines said, employers would be required to give longer breaks to workers.

Employers would be given flexibility to alternate break times for different workers, and they can split break periods into shorter ones so as to minimise the effects on work progress.]]>

    Jail term needed for not reporting child abuse: govt

    <![CDATA[The Undersecretary for Labour and Welfare, Ho Kai-ming, on Monday said jail terms for professionals who fail to report suspected child abuse cases should be kept in the draft legislation. 

According to the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill, which is currently making its way through the Legislative Council, the maximum penalty for not reporting suspected severe child abuse cases would be a three-month jail term and a fine of HK$50,000. 

Several lawmakers have suggested removing the prison term, saying it is too harsh.

Speaking at a Legco's bills committee, Ho reassured lawmakers that professionals, who work with children, would only face prison if they fail to report extremely severe cases.

"Professionals will only face imprisonment in extremely severe cases. This means that professionals, who genuinely suspect that a child has suffered significant harm - or is facing actual risks - yet fail to report it without meeting any exemptions for reporting or providing any reasonable justifications, only then will prosecution be initiated," he explained. 

Ho warned that scrapping a prison sentence from the bill would lower the effectiveness of the legislation, and society would have to bear the consequences.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Monday that a "soft sell" approach will be adopted when it comes to promoting patriotism in Hong Kong.

Chan, who chairs the new Working Group on Patriotic Education, said the group is aimed at integrating patriotism into core values of the community, but this will not involve "hard sell" tactics.

"Patriotism is not something that can be learnt by repeating from memory. Getting to understand is the first step. The ultimate goal is to achieve emotional identification. Sincerely identify with the country, feel proud of the country and then consciously love and protect the country," Chan told reporters after an inaugural meeting of the working group.

Chan said the group will make reference to the mainland's patriotic education law and come up with appropriate and suitable proposals for the SAR.

But he said the government has no plans to legislate patriotism and will rely on policies and activities to promote it.

Chan also said the government will organise various activities and celebrations in the run-up to October's 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, to enable young people to learn more about their country.]]>

    <![CDATA[Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Monday said national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law places no "extra and unreasonable" restrictions on press freedom and the media can still sharply criticise the government. 

In an op-ed published in Ming Pao Daily, the minister said there was no move to introduce restrictions on the press through the law.

He said the administration wants the media to pass on accurate, fair and positive information so that officials can lead society to make changes.

"At the same time, [officials] need to comprehensively know the ideas, needs and demands from the public [through the press]," Lam wrote.

He said so long as the media continue to be impartial, objective and fair in adhering to fundamental professional codes in seeking the truth, there is no need for journalists to be particularly concerned about violating the security law.

In the piece titled "Change and no change", Lam said while the enactment of the homegrown security law last month marked a major change, there are also things that have remained constant such as the values of common law and the rule of law.

"On the one hand it improved the legislation on safeguarding national security. It also fully respects fundamental human rights and freedoms on the other," he wrote.]]>

    <![CDATA[Lawmakers and families of pupils at an aided Catholic school in Wan Chai on Sunday accused education officials of inaction over the institution's decision to shut earlier than it had originally planned. 

Rosaryhill Secondary School on Stubbs Road first announced last September that it would cease operations after the 2025-26 academic year. 

The government-aided school later said it would arrange for Form One to Five pupils to transfer to Yu Chun Keung Memorial College No 2 this September. Rosaryhill Kindergarten and Rosaryhill (Primary) School, meanwhile, will be combined with Dalton School Hong Kong.

The brother of a Form Five pupil – a former Rosaryhill student himself – expressed concerns about his sister's education at her new school.

”The Education Bureau was relatively passive and not willing to help us on this issue... Pupils are not as simple as assets that you could transfer to others," he said. 

The mother of a Form Three student condemned the Education Bureau for not having met parents over the issue, which she said weighed heavily on her son. 

Election Committee legislator Doreen Kong urged the administration to address the issue. 

“We don't want this to happen again. The [Education Bureau] must explain to the public what the principles are and what the policies of the government are in handling all these similar situations,” she said. 

"They have to come out to help the students and to ensure that there is a smooth transition for all the students, especially to overcome their psychological distress."

Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, for his part, said he would file a complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman. 

“I find that the school is not professional enough to take care of the students. And the administrative side is also not totally concerned about the rights and interests of students and parents... I want to clarify, during the process, what role did the administration play," he said. 

Tik said he would also talk to authorities on pushing back the school’s shutdown, to let senior secondary pupils finish their studies there.]]>

    Govt mulls manhole training for all sewer workers

    <![CDATA[Development minister Bernadette Linn said officials want to step up training of sewer workers to prevent incidents involving manholes.

Her comments came after the death of two workers last week at a manhole in Sha Tin, the same site where two others died nearly two decades ago. 

Speaking on a TVB programme, Linn said the contracts state that workers should only operate on the ground, and if relevant works require them to enter the manhole, only qualified personnel are allowed and risk assessment must be conducted beforehand. 

She also said officials are looking into adding clauses to future contracts, requiring workers who only conduct cleaning on the ground to go through training as well.

"If you do enter manholes [in future], you have to inform the Drainage Services Department beforehand and receive its approval," she said.

"We're considering making it mandatory for those doing the cleaning on the ground to also go through manhole training. This is to raise their awareness."

Separately, Linn said officials are considering whether to immediately prosecute homeowners found to have illegal structures, rather than issuing orders for removal.

The government has been reviewing the Buildings Ordinance after cases of unauthorised structures were reported.

The development secretary said the administration is studying whether the prosecution process can be streamlined, the prosecution threshold lowered and relevant fines raised.

She noted that a clause in the current legislation stipulates harsher penalties for offenders who "knowingly" violate the law. Linn said officials want to remove such wording, which she said allows homeowners to claim they were not aware of the illegal structures and that the problem had already existed before they bought the place.

But the minister said officials will make sure the relevant amendments – to be put forward in the final quarter of this year – will be reasonable.]]>
