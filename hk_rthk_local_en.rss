    Revamp involving railway police aims to boost policing

    <![CDATA[Police said they are integrating some 300 police officers in the Railway District into five land regions from the middle of this month, in a bid to improve operation efficiency and anti-terrorism efforts. 

After a one-month trial period, officers from the land regions will take over the duties of railway police, including daily patrols and response to railway incidents, in June.

Established in 1985, the Railway District is responsible for maintaining law and order in the railway system.  

Stephen Yu, a district commander of the Railway District, said their work was affected by problems such as MTR service disruptions in the past.

"We see the challenge and we encounter challenges in that by relying solely on the MTR trains as our only means of transportation to respond to rail incidents is difficult and that would hinder our professional response. The public definitely would like to see their reports to be dealt with promptly and timely," he said.

"For example, if there's an incident happening in one of the MTR stations, our officers will encounter problems and difficulty to get to the scene of the incident because of the suspension of the train service. Now, what we think is it would be much easier and it would be much more timely for the officers from the service side to respond. Now, that includes the emergency unit, police tactical unit, and the patrol unit of the service formation."

Under the revamp, the railway police will be overseen by the police headquarters, instead of the Kowloon East regional headquarters.  

The operations wing’s chief superintendent, Pierre Wong, said it does not mean that the long-standing Railway District is being “dissolved”.  

"I won't use the word of dissolving the rail district. What I will use is the enhancement of the policing project because the railway district will subsequently come under the command of the operations wing of the police headquarters. So you can't say it's not existing. It will continue to exist. 

"Our focus is to, through the operation deployment arrangement, enhance the overall capability of our officers. That is our objective."

Officers said they will also combine the railway response team and the counter-terrorism response unit to beef up counter-terrorism efforts.]]>

    Govt to ask online platforms to remove protest song

    <![CDATA[Justice Secretary Paul Lam said the government will ask internet service providers to remove the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong", adding that such a move will not hinder normal journalistic and academic activities.

Speaking to reporters after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order banning the song, Lam said the ruling is not meant to target tech giants such as Google or Meta. 

"So the effect is to persuade the internet service provider not to provide the convenience and not to facilitate the commission of unlawful act. And that also makes it crystal clear that the injunction is not aiming at restricting the normal operation of any internet service provider," he said. 

"Free flow of information is of crucial importance to Hong Kong. This is a core value that we will do our best to maintain and preserve." 

Chief Executive John Lee also welcomed the ruling. 

In a Facebook post, he wrote that the injunction safeguards national security and the dignity of the national anthem. 

Lee said the song was used to incite acts endangering national security and "Hong Kong independence", causing harm to both the SAR and the country. 

In banning the song, the Court of Appeal on Wednesday overturned a lower court ruling last year, with the three judges agreeing with the administration that there was a compelling need to grant an injunction on national security grounds.

The injunction bans anyone "with seditious intent" from playing or performing the song.

Lam added that the court ruling will not lead to unreasonable restrictions on freedom of expression. 

"The Court of Appeal actually conducts the well-known proportionality test to consider whether a grant of injunction would in fact lead to any disproportional or unreasonable restriction on the freedom of expression," the secretary for justice said.

"But after conducting that proportionality analysis, the court came to the conclusion that in all the circumstances, the injunction would not constitute any unreasonable restriction on freedom of expression."

In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular briefing that “preventing anyone from using or disseminating the relevant song with the intention of inciting secession and insulting the national anthem is a legitimate and necessary measure by the SAR government to fulfil its responsibility of safeguarding national security”.]]>

    Maintenance work to close four MTR stations on July 28

    <![CDATA[The MTR Corporation on Wednesday said it would close a major stretch of the Kwun Tong Line for a rare, full-day maintenance operation later this year.  

There will be no service between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on Sunday, July 28. 

Cheris Lee, who heads the corporation's operating and metro segment, said all four stations affected would still be served by either the Tsuen Wan or Tuen Ma lines, while free bus services would run between Yau Ma Tei, Ho Man Tin and Whampoa. 

She said the asset renewal work would be completed in time for people to get to work on the following Monday.

"I think the reason why we chose the 28th of July is because it is in the middle of the summer holiday. We believe that quite a number of citizens will be on holiday on that day, and that students also have no school on that day. We are trying to minimise the impact to the passengers and also to the citizens in the town," she said. 

KH Lee, chief of the corporation's operations engineering maintenance, said they would replace more than 50 large metal hangers used for hanging power cables on the tunnel ceiling of the crossover near Yau Ma Tei Station, adding the work was necessary based on asset condition and life cycle.

"There are lots of complexity not only because of the preparation of those safety precautions, but also all the work associated with this sort of hangar replacement, like in the course of the hangar replacement, we have to relocate and dismantle some of the existing overhead line and also their parts," he said.

"Upon completion of the work, we have also arranged tests to ensure every system is in good order before we resume the service, so there's a reason why we have decided to have a one-day closure together with the two non-traffic hours.That means before and after to complete the work in one go."

He added several stations would need to carry out similar tunnel facility renewal projects in the next three years.

Some people RTHK spoke to said repair work was inevitable for maintaining efficient railway services.

"There needs to be maintenance from time to time as facilities start to age, or there will be more signal failures in the future. That would lead to longer waiting times, which is very troublesome for people," said a man surnamed Wong.

Another man named Tsoi said he would leave earlier than his usual time when using the train that day.

A woman named Lam said she is a bit worried that there will be huge crowds while travelling that day.
 
"It could be quite disruptive to people especially since they are working during travelling hours at some of the busiest stations," she said.]]>

    Court grants injunction over 'Glory to Hong Kong'

    <![CDATA[The Court of Appeal on Wednesday granted a temporary injunction order banning the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong".

In their decision, judges Jeremy Poon, Carlye Chu and Anthea Pang said they agreed with the administration that there was a compelling need to grant an injunction on national security grounds.

The injunction bans anyone "with seditious intent" from playing or performing the song.

The judges said criminal law alone could not achieve the purpose of safeguarding national security regarding the matter, since it is not practicable to bring proceedings against "unidentifiable" people online who commit offences in relation to the song. 

They noted that there had been "widespread and persistent" flouting of the law before and especially after the national security law came into force in 2020.

"Such is the seriousness of the criminal problems that the court must intervene immediately to prevent the continuation of the prevailing unlawful state of affairs; otherwise any further damage to national security would likely to be irreparable," the judgement read.

The judges also said the injunction was necessary to persuade internet platforms to remove "problematic" content.

They agreed with a lower court ruling earlier that the injunction may have “chilling effects”, but said it has addressed concerns about the right to free expression by allowing exceptions for lawful action connected to the song, such as academic and reporting activities.

A lower court had last year rejected the government's bid for an injunction, saying it would be "of no real utility". The Department of Justice appealed against that ruling.]]>

    <![CDATA[Labour minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said professionals who came to Hong Kong through a new admission scheme have created billions of dollars of economic output.

Speaking on the second day of a talent summit in Wan Chai, Sun said the government recently conducted a study to see how they are doing in Hong Kong.

"We estimate that the more than 30,000 people who had arrived here through the Top Talent Pass Scheme in 2023 can bring in about HK$34 billion of direct economic contribution to Hong Kong a year," he said.

"This means they help boost our GDP by around 1.2 percent a year."

The official said many of these professionals moved to the SAR with their young families - with two-thirds of them being under 40 - and helped rejuvenate the city’s ageing society.

Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said a memorandum of understanding newly signed between the 11 cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) would help expats settle in the GBA.]]>

    <![CDATA[Lawmakers on Wednesday passed the budget bill by a show of hands, with no one calling for a recorded vote. 

Financial Secretary Paul Chan thanked legislators for their support, saying officials will do their best to implement relevant measures in a speedy manner. 

He also said Hong Kong is consolidating its finances in light of a budget deficit, much like many economies around the world coping with the post-pandemic environment. 

The finance chief said the government is seeking to cut costs and find new sources of revenue.

"We're confident and we also have determination to balance the books in around three years' time," he told lawmakers in the chamber.

"That does not include the proceeds from bond issuance. We're implementing a fiscal consolidation programme that is a common practice around the world."

Chan stressed that money received from issuing bonds will not be spent on recurrent expenditure, but on investment and infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis.

He said Hong Kong is in the midst of an economic transition with both opportunities and challenges, but the former outnumber the latter.

The minister said the SAR needs to grasp the international situation better, and understand the country's development strategy as well as focus on meeting different challenges.]]>

    Court reduces jail term of ear biter by 6 months

    <![CDATA[The man who bit off part of an ear of then-district councillor Andrew Chiu in 2019 had his sentence reduced by half a year on appeal.

Joe Chen was ordered to serve 14.5 years behind bars in 2022, after being found guilty of three counts of wounding with intent and a count of common assault. 

He had used a knife to stab a couple and kicked another woman on the same day before he bit Chiu outside Cityplaza in Taikoo Shing, following a protest that took place in the shopping centre in November 2019.

Handing down judgment on Wednesday, the Court of Appeal said Chen had paid damages of HK$3.9 million to the four people he had attacked and he had sold his flat to pay the unusually large sum of civil claim money.

Appeal court judges Derek Pang and Anthea Pang said High Court judge Judianna Barnes should have considered the payment as a mitigating factor.

They said Chen had "showed his sincerity" by starting to make compensation arrangements even before the trial of this case began, which greatly reduced the suffering of the four victims during the civil claim process.

But the appeal court judges disagreed with the appellant's lawyers that the starting point of the sentence was too high, noting the victims were traumatised both physically and psychologically.

Chiu lost part of his left ear as a result, and the other man surnamed Wan, who sustained multiple knife injuries, suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

The judges added they did not agree that Chen had assaulted the four because he was triggered, noting he was the one who initiated a brawl with Wan.

The fact that Chen, under the influence of alcohol, lost his temper and attacked the victims after Wan swore at him, did not make him less culpable, the judges said.

They also refused to accept the appellant's promise to donate his body for scientific research after death as a proof of positive good character.]]>

    <![CDATA[The government said on Wednesday that it will consider asking suppliers of non-plastic tableware to voluntarily submit quality and safety certificates, amid concerns that some products could contain carcinogenic substances.

Green groups have cited overseas studies as showing that some non-plastic utensils and food containers, including some made from paper, wood and bamboo, have been found to contain the "forever chemicals" PFAS, which have been linked to cancer and fertility issues.

Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said officials are aware that there have been public concerns about the quality and safety of such products since a ban on single-use plastic items came into effect last month. 

In a written reply to a question from lawmaker Chan Siu-hung, Tse said the authorities don't demand information on any PFAS content in non-plastic tableware.

"To provide better services to the public and the trade, the government will consider inviting suppliers to voluntarily submit relevant certificates or documents, and listing out non-plastic tableware with these certificates or documents for reference," Tse said.

He also cited international research organisations as saying PFAS only pose a very low risk to people's health when products only contain trace amounts of the substances.]]>

    <![CDATA[The government's investment promotion agency and its office to attract strategic firms to the city on Wednesday said it had lured 45 companies in the life sciences and health technology sector to set up, or expand their businesses in the SAR since the end of 2022. 

InvestHK said these companies, the majority of which were based on the mainland, had invested a total of HK$6.5 billion into the city, creating around 3,200 jobs. 

Speaking at a media briefing, Maggie Lo, from the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, said these firms, including pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, were impressed by the level of support available in Hong Kong. 

"When we approach overseas companies and when we introduce our initiatives and opportunities, they were pleasantly surprised that the Hong Kong government has catered funding incentives to support every stage of their development — from basic research, clinical trials, manufacturing to sales and marketing," she explained. 

Lo added officials would continue to encourage international enterprises to expand their businesses in Hong Kong.]]>

    'Earlier queues for dental clinics not that helpful'

   <description>
    <![CDATA[A lawmaker and a patients' rights advocate on Wednesday said the government's plan to bring forward the pre-registration hours for public dental clinics only deals with the symptoms of a queuing problem, and not the cause. 

Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau told lawmakers on Tuesday that people will be allowed to sign up for next-day emergency treatment from 8pm, instead of from midnight.

The move follows criticism from the Audit Commission which found patients queuing for hours overnight to be in with a chance of getting an appointment the following day.

On an RTHK radio programme, Tim Pang from the Society for Community Organisation said the real problem is that there aren't enough public dentists.

“The queue will just start earlier in the day ... because the root of the problem is the insufficient manpower of the Department of Health, leading to insufficient service availability. Therefore, no matter how the queuing arrangements are changed, the core problem is actually manpower,” he said. 

Echoing Pang's view, lawmaker Chan Hoi-yan noted on the same programme that there are only about 20,000 appointments available at public clinics each day, just half of the pre-pandemic level.

“For every 1,000 citizens, we only have 0.37 dentists... we have a significantly lower number of dentists compared to other cities,” said Chan, who chairs Legco's panel on health services.

Meanwhile, a former president of the Hong Kong Dental Association, Nelson Wong, said 108 of 300 Department of Health dentist positions are vacant at the moment.]]>

    <![CDATA[A liver disease patient who passed away a few months after two transplants died of misadventure, a jury at the Coroner's Court ruled on Tuesday.

The five-person jury returned the majority verdict following a 13-day inquest into the death of Tang Kwai-sze, with experts divided on what caused her liver failure.

Tang, a hepatitis B carrier, had two liver transplants in April 2017 after suffering from acute liver failure. She died in August that year at the age of 44.

The two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.

Delivering its verdict, the jury said Tang suffered from hepatitis B flare-up because of her taking high-dose steroids without being prescribed antiviral medication at the same time.

In guiding the jury to make its recommendations, coroner Monica Chow said jurors needed to consider whether new measures by the Hospital Authority (HA), including a guideline on antiviral prescription for hepatitis B carriers using immunosuppressive therapy, were enough to protect patients.

The jury made five recommendations to the HA, including requiring doctors to prescribe antiviral drugs for patients on high-dose steroids for even less than seven days, subsidising hepatitis B carriers to do regular check-ups at private hospitals, educating them about precautions and symptoms, making sure doctors' clinical records were clear, and providing a reason when laboratories cancelled a test.

Wrapping up the hearing, the coroner told Tang's eldest daughter Michelle Wu that while her love for her mum would not fade with time, she hoped Wu could "one day fill the void left by her mother in a positive way".

The coroner noted that Wu had volunteered to donate her liver to her mother and that showed how brave she was. 

"All mothers in the world will tell you that [Tang] would feel comforted and proud to have such a brave, selfless, and loving daughter like you," Chow said.

The United Christian Hospital, in response, said it respects the jury's verdict and will study its suggestions in detail.

It said it had put in place measures to improve the process of prescribing medicine and the communication between medical workers and patients.

The hospital again expressed condolences to Tang's family and said it would assist them where needed.

    <![CDATA[Security chief Chris Tang on Tuesday said the police want to build a digital platform to store images and videos with evidential or intelligence value, instead of using DVDs.

The official told a Legco security panel meeting that it would be more efficient and less labour-intensive to upload materials to an e-platform than to store them on DVDs.

Lawmakers, including Chow Man-kong from the election committee, said it is time to go digital.

"A friend of mine wanted to give the police a USB memory stick that contains dash camera footage to lodge a complaint on traffic matters, but they couldn't do that and were asked to submit a DVD. They were shocked," he said.

The official said the system will cost HK$359 million - down from the HK$390 million previously estimated - and should be available in 2026, if Legco approves the funding.

Tang said the platform would not be equipped with artificial intelligence or facial recognition capabilities, but those could be added later.

"We agree that incorporating AI programmes to our Centralised Digital Image Platform will help us investigate cases. We will deal with it at the next stage," he said.

"We just need the money, the technology is already here and it can be added [to our platform] easily. I believe it's something that has to be done in future."

The police also want to develop a new personnel information system, which will cost HK$142 million.

The legislature's finance committee will scrutinise the two funding requests.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police on Tuesday arrested five men over an alleged armed robbery attempt at a jewellery store in Tsim Sha Tsui. 

At around noon, five people entered the store at the intersection of Hankow Road and Haiphong Road carrying knives and hammers, officers said.

Police said they had been tipped-off about a planned robbery and were waiting nearby. 

"During the operation to make the arrests, officers had drawn their guns as a warning because the robbers were holding knives and hammers. After the warning, we still used our bare hands to control them," said Superintendent Gar Kam-lam.

"One of those arrested suffered a minor injury on his face," Gar added.]]>

    <![CDATA[As the city held a summit on global talent, the Hong Kong Talent Engage began a two-day career expo on Tuesday, attracting professionals from the mainland and foreign countries. 

A job seeker from Brazil said he had worked in two mainland cities, Shanghai and Hangzhou, for five years and had just come to Hong Kong through the Top Talent Pass Scheme. 

He said the talent scheme makes it easier for people like him to work in the SAR.

"With this visa, I have this opportunity to come, and there's no limitations on what kinds of companies I can work for... This city is very business friendly. People have an entrepreneurial mind," he told RTHK. 

The Top Talent Pass Scheme is one of several talent-admission schemes introduced by the SAR government, and even people who have not secured a job offer in Hong Kong can apply for it.

Another job seeker from Sichuan Province said she wanted to find a job in Hong Kong because of the labour market situation on the mainland.

"I could hardly get a [response from mainland companies]. I think I can find more opportunities here. I think I can improve my skills and have a better lifestyle here," she said.

A recruitment agency said support for workers was very important in order to retain them in a long run.

"I believe a lot of talent from outside of Hong Kong have got all skill sets that we lack or we're short of," said Eric Ng, chief strategy officer at the agency.

"I think all the corporations need to get ready so that they not only can attract them to come, but can retain the talent."

The Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, Professor David Cardwell, echoed Labour Secretary Chris Sun's views that a focus should be on attracting talent from Southeast Asia.

"Some of the best talent, academic talent, are in Southeast Asia. The world just needs to adapt to that, to celebrate those talents, but Southeast Asia needs to make it easy for the world to do that as well," he said.

The CareerConnect Expo runs from Tuesday to Wednesday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.]]>

    'Improved dental registration to avoid queuing pain'

    <![CDATA[Preliminary registration for dental appointments at government clinics will start four hours earlier than usual from July to prevent patients from queuing overnight and making multiple trips, according to officials, after the city's auditor called on authorities to review the arrangements.

The Audit Commission earlier observed some patients queuing up for hours at clinics just to try to get an appointment for the following day before registration starts at 12am. 

Under current arrangements, patients who have pre-registered to see the dentist must return to the clinic in person in the morning to pick up a disc for their appointment. 

At Legco's public accounts committee, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said registration would instead begin at 8pm for the following day's slots starting from July. 

"After [preliminary] registration, patients only need to report to the clinic half an hour before the appointed time and have their identity cards checked, and then they can receive service. The improved arrangement can avoid the pain of queueing overnight and making multiple journeys to the clinics," he told lawmakers.

From Thursday, registration and disc distribution at a Sai Kung government dental clinic would begin at 1pm instead of 11am, so that patients can immediately receive services that begin at 1:30pm. 

He also said an electronic system for appointment registration at dental clinics was in the pipeline. 

"Patients no longer have to physically get a disc. The online platform will provide information of the number of remaining quota discs of the 11 clinics. We have started the work of developing the system, which will be launched shortly," Lo said. 

Officials attributed a shortage of dental staff to difficulties in increasing the annual quota of appointment slots, with Director of Health Ronald Lam pointing to a shortfall of 108 practitioners, which accounted for 30 percent of the total manpower. 

Lam said authorities decided to allocate to more resources to serving the underprivileged by raising the number of slots from 20,000 to 60,000 next year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Tuesday said the government's efforts to attract talent to the city will focus on professionals from Southeast Asia and Europe. 

Sun’s remark came after the government approved 180,000 talent importation scheme applications, with 120,000 people having already arrived in the SAR.

Speaking to reporters at the Global Talent Summit, Sun said most of the applicants were from the mainland.

But the labour minister said the government is committed to welcoming talent from all over the world, with a focus on Southeast Asia and Europe.

"We are very sure once we have let them know all the growth prospects, all the very exciting opportunities here in Hong Kong, a lot of the talents in Southeast Asia as well as in Europe, they will be thinking about Hong Kong and they will really give Hong Kong a good shot," he said.

Sun said the government expects around 7,000 people to attend the two-day summit at the Convention and Exhibition Centre.]]>

    <![CDATA[Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Wang Xiaoping on Tuesday said the central government fully supports Hong Kong in attracting international entrepreneurs and talent to develop their ambitions in the SAR, as well as the integration of the Greater Bay Area into global innovation networks.

Speaking at the Global Talent Summit in Wan Chai, Wang said the nation has the largest talent resources pool in the world, with over 80 million technical professionals and over 200 million skilled workers.

The number of people who have received higher education exceeds 240 million, while China is ranked first in the world for the number of research and development personnel and patent applications, the minister added.

Wang said these things provide a solid foundation for the nation to support Hong Kong in building a “new highland” of international talent.

“The central government attaches great importance to Hong Kong's role in building human resources, and fully supports Hong Kong in conducting wider and closer exchanges and cooperation with other parts of the world to attract aspiring entrepreneurs to Hong Kong to develop their ambitions”, said Wang.

“We support building a high-level talent base in the Greater Bay Area, attracting global high-level innovation talent, businesses, as well as research institutions to the Greater Bay Area, as well as promoting the region to be integrated into the global innovation networks,” she added.

Pointing to China’s transition towards high-quality development, the minister also said the nation will concentrate on industrial modernisation and cultivate more high-quality, innovative professionals to develop “new quality productive forces”.

The nation will also push forward creating mechanisms and platforms to introduce global talent into the Greater Bay Area, which will provide new impetus for Hong Kong’s prosperity and integration into national development, she said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that Hong Kong is the place to be for global talent, in part because the SAR has long been one of Asia's most liveable cities. 

Speaking at a government-organised summit on talent, the CE said Hong Kong is the only city where "the global and China advantages" come together. 

He added that other institutional strengths include prime business prospects because of the One Country, Two Systems principle, a low tax system as well as the free flow of information, capital, goods and people. 

Lee said language is never a problem because English and Chinese are both official languages in the SAR, and Hong Kong will get even more multilingual as it thrives as a cultural hub where East meets West.

He noted that 40 percent of the territory is earmarked as country parks with a UNESCO geopark, endless hiking trails and stunning beaches.

"In Hong Kong, you don't just get world-class work opportunities, you get a satisfying life, too," Lee said in an opening speech at the summit.

"Yes, choosing to relocate to Hong Kong on your own or with your loved ones is a big decision. But I'm here to tell you, that this is the place where you can work hard, play hard and enjoy hard."

Lee said the central government's recent move to relax visa rules for Shanghai and Beijing businesspeople to come to Hong Kong will promote professional exchanges and reinforce the SAR's role as the country's international talent hub.

The CE also thanked senior officials from Beijing, particularly Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Wang Xiaoping, as well as those from Guangdong and Macau, for attending the summit and sharing their ideas.]]>
