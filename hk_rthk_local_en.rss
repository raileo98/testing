    <![CDATA[The 9th Hong Kong Games began on Sunday with an opening ceremony held at the Coliseum. 

Cheerleading, a wushu performance and skateboarding were just some of the spectacles kicking off the biennial sports competition.

Athletes from the territory's 18 districts entered the venue before table tennis players Minnie Soo and Ding Ning, wushu athlete Samuel Hui and badminton player Wang Yilyu took part in a torch relay, lighting the cauldron together to signify the beginning of the games.

Under Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Raistlin Lau gave the opening speech. He said President Xi Jinping has emphasised the importance of sports for improving people's health and realising the Chinese dream.

"The biennial Hong Kong Games is a major sports event for all Hong Kong citizens. This is not only a good opportunity for Hong Kong athletes to show their strength, but also an excellent platform to promote 'Sports for All'," Lau said.

"This year, the Hong Kong Games has entered its ninth session. I know that in the next two months, there will be more than 4,600 athletes competing in eight events and a total of more than 1,000 games."

The inter-district sports event runs until June 9, with competitions in athletics, badminton, 3-on-3 basketball, futsal, swimming, table tennis, tennis and volleyball.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Sunday explained its decision not to hold a march on May 1, saying members don't want one and it has come up with "more effective" channels for workers to express their opinions. 

The group hasn't held its customary Labour Day march since before the Covid pandemic. 

"The some 400,000 members and 200 unions gathered on the platform of the FTU to promote labour values and the labour spirit. We are holding a series of activities in the upcoming week simply because that's what workers want. Not holding a march doesn't mean we are avoiding anything," said FTU president and lawmaker Stanley Ng. 

"We think those activities are more effective channels to let workers express their opinions," he told reporters at a press conference.  

FTU chairman and lawmaker Kingsley Wong said as part of its Labour Day campaign, the group has invited senior government officials, including Chief Executive John Lee, Chief Secretary Eric Chan and Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, to meet frontline workers from various industries to learn about their needs. 

He added that the group will also submit proposals on labour matters to the government next week.]]>

    <![CDATA[Two men have been arrested after several renovation and engineering companies were scammed out of a total of HK$1.5million, police said on Sunday.

Officers said the companies were given work on what were purported to be school projects and were persuaded to use particular suppliers for materials. 

The firms were tricked into believing they had received deposits for the work, via forged screenshots of remittance records or cheques that bounced, before they made payments to the "suppliers".

"Once the victims made payments to those fake suppliers, they would lose all communication to the [fraudsters] and suppliers. Then the companies eventually realised they had been scammed,” said Chief Inspector Tam Tsz-wai.  

Officers said they arrested two men, aged 33 and 44, in Yuen Long on Friday, on suspicion of obtaining property by deception. 

Tam urged companies to check with their banks that their account balances increase following payments from clients, to ensure that the transactions have not been manipulated.]]>

    <![CDATA[Magic mushrooms, marijuana candy and LSD stamps were among a haul of drugs worth around HK$12 million seized in Yau Tong last week, police said on Sunday.

Officers said they raided a factory building in the area on April 19 and another the following day, after discovering that the sites were being used for manufacturing and trafficking dangerous drugs destined to be sold in Hong Kong. 

A 25-year-old man was arrested. 

"During the operation, our officers seized drugs with a total market value of more than 12 million dollars, including 12.5 kilogrammes of heroin, 8 kilogrammes of marijuana flowers, 270 sticks of marijuana vape juice, 500 millilitres of marijuana oil, marijuana candy and cookies, magic mushrooms and LSD stamps," said Senior Inspector Matthew Fung.

"Our officers also examined tools found in one of the units suspected to be used for manufacturing and packaging the drugs. We believe that this operation has successfully cut off the supply chain of this drug trafficking group."

Fung said officers were trying to trace the source of the raw materials used to produce the drugs found.]]>

    <![CDATA[Trees came down in several parts of the city, some rail services were disrupted and the observatory reported a waterspout on Sunday, as strong winds and thunderstorms battered Hong Kong.

The Peak Tram stopped running after a tree came down on Barker Road, while another fell on Wylie Road in Ho Ma Tin, temporarily blocking traffic. 

There was disruption to East Rail Line services for around an hour in the afternoon, with emergency maintenance work taking place at University Station after the wind apparently ripped away part of the canopy above one of the platforms. 

Officials said some high-speed train services between Hong Kong and the mainland would be delayed due to the bad weather conditions. 

Meanwhile, speed limits on the bridge to Macau and Zhuhai were reduced due to the high winds, the Transport Department said.

The Amber Rainstorm Warning was issued at 10am and while it was cancelled at 1.45pm, a thunderstorm warning remained in place.  

The observatory said intense gusts reaching 80 kilometres per hour or above could continue to affect the territory, as it also warned of possible flooding from rivers. 

At around 9.30 in the morning, a waterspout was spotted in Clear Water Bay, the observatory said.

It added that more thundery showers are forecast throughout the rest of the week. 

Meanwhile, authorities in Guangdong warned of the risk of floods from rivers, waterways and reservoirs after days of torrential rain. 

Officials in localities and municipalities across the province were told to begin emergency planning to avert any disasters.

    <![CDATA[Financial secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said new measures announced by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to cooperate with Hong Kong's capital market demonstrate the central government's support for the SAR.

Writing on his blog, Chan said the commission will support leading mainland companies in listing in Hong Kong, by stepping up communication and coordination among government departments.

The official said he learnt during a trip to Hangzhou and Suzhou last week that many companies have applied to list in Hong Kong, or are considering doing so.

He said the companies like Hong Kong for its institutional advantages, including intellectual property protection and internationalisation, as well as the synergy with other Greater Bay Area cities.

"They hope to use Hong Kong as their preferred springboard and platform to enter the international market, including establishing treasury centres and even international headquarters in Hong Kong," Chan said.

The finance chief said having more companies with great potential listed on Hong Kong's bourse will attract more international capital and solidify the SAR's status as an international financial hub.

Chan said that some technology firms from Hangzhou are also setting up research centres in the SAR as the two cities are about to establish a platform for technological collaboration.]]>

    <![CDATA[Environment and Ecology Secretary Tse Chin-wan says businesses do not have to worry too much about a ban on plastic tableware that takes effect from Monday, as it's not the government's goal to "punish" them with the policy.

Writing on his blog, the official said vendors can use up their plastic products during a six-month grace period so they will not be wasted.

Tse added that even when the grace period ends, authorities will educate vendors first in case of violation, instead of taking enforcement action immediately.

"We understand that a process of changing customs is needed, and it will take time for businesses to adjust the way they operate to comply with the ban. So, we will try our best to provide appropriate assistance when implementing the policy," Tse wrote.

The official said the catering, retail and hotel sectors all support the measure that will see restaurants banned from selling and using polystyrene tableware and plastic cutlery, while hotels will no longer be allowed to provide free plastic products like toothbrushes.

Tse said many hotels have switched to wooden toothbrushes and combs, while some eateries have bought non-plastic cutlery.

He called on restaurants to choose suitable eco-tableware, noting that there have been concerns that paper pulp cutlery might become unusable when soaked in hot liquids.

"There are many choices in addition to paper pulp, including wood, bamboo, bagasse pulp, wood pulp and straw pulp. Local restaurants serve a wide variety of food, and they should choose suitable tableware based on the different dishes they serve," Tse said.

The minister added that restaurants will not be required by law to charge customers for non-plastic tableware.]]>

    <![CDATA[Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk on Sunday said care teams tasked with supporting people from ethnic minority groups will start providing services later this year.

At an Equal Opportunities Commission event, Cheuk said the government is committed to helping non-Chinese residents integrate into the community, saying they are vital to Hong Kong society. 

“They are no doubt an integral part of the Hong Kong family, working dutifully and diligently across various professions and areas. Our non-ethnic Chinese brothers and sisters have made equal contributions to the growth of Hong Kong,” Cheuk said.

The deputy chief secretary said that as well as the care teams, preparations are underway for two new ethnic minority support centres, in Kowloon and the New Territories.

Cheuk said there are over 300,000 non-Chinese people in the SAR, many of them working in various industries including government positions.

“In terms of employment, the government encourages departments to design their own language tests, to provide an additional pathway for ethnic minority applicants to meet the appointment requirements on language proficiency,” he said.

“For instance, more than 300 ethnic minority applicants have passed the Chinese or English written examination designed for police recruitment. This would allow ethnic minorities who may not have participated in public examinations in Hong Kong to gain the opportunity to join and work for the government.”

Cheuk also noted that a pilot counselling service centre for ethnic minority residents launched at the end of last year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said on Sunday that Hong Kong's shortage of talent in the innovation and technology sector will improve with time.

He made the comment on a radio programme after 59 local, mainland and overseas enterprises signed Memoranda of Understanding with the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park last week.

Sun said dozens of tech enterprises have expanded their businesses in the territory, with many of them in the life and health, new energy and microelectronics technology sectors. 

However, he said, there is a lack of manpower in the industry.

"I feel that we are certainly lacking talents in this area, but it's already getting better. We have plans to attract talent through the Technology Talent Admission Scheme and the innovation and technology institutions set up," he told Commercial Radio. 

"All the innovation and technology policies we have launched can attract and train local talents, so I believe if we continue in this direction, we will have more and more talents in the next few years."

Sun stressed that policies implemented must be consistent with the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint, to boost high-quality development in the field.]]>

    'Restaurants to utilize non-plastic grace period'

    <![CDATA[A representative of the catering industry on Sunday said that many small and medium-sized restaurants will continue to use plastic utensils despite the upcoming ban on the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.

Speaking on RTHK's Hashtag Hong Kong, Simon Wong, the president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said many restaurant owners will take advantage of a six-month adjustment period after the ban takes effect on Monday. 

During this time, government officials will focus on educating people rather than strictly enforcing the ban.

"Many restaurant operators are, at the moment, not eager to use non-plastic tableware as the government is giving a six-month grace period to the trade, such that operators will not be fined if they do not follow the regulation on and after April 22," he said. 

"On the other hand, it would give enough time for importers and wholesalers as well as retailers to consume or deal with their inventories within the allowable period. This period would also offer more time for the catering industry to find more suitable products to suit their budget and needs."

Wong mentioned that large restaurant chains would be the first to switch to non-plastic alternatives. 

However, he added that small and medium-sized restaurants are concerned about the increased costs in the current tough economic climate.

Wong noted that eco-friendly options are currently 20 to 30 per cent more expensive than plastic utensils, but he believes the cost will come down in the future.

He urged the government to step up education and public awareness campaigns to inform people about the importance of reducing waste and protecting the environment.]]>

    <![CDATA[The government on Saturday strongly condemned a statement issued by foreign ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) countries and the High Representative of the European Union, saying it deliberately misled the public and smeared the National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.

A government spokesman described the statement as "unfounded and biased". He stressed that it was Hong Kong's constitutional duty to safeguard national security. 

"Many common law jurisdictions, including western countries such as the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as Singapore, have enacted multiple pieces of legislation to safeguard national security," he said. 

"Turning a blind eye to the fact and making exaggerated remarks, the G7 foreign ministers and the High Representative of the EU have demonstrated typical political hegemony and hypocrisy with double standards." 

The G7 statement expressed concerns about civil and political rights and freedoms in Hong Kong in light of the introduction of the National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance under Article 23 of the Basic Law. 

The government spokesman dismissed the criticism, saying that the legislation would not affect normal business operations, adding that law-abiding businessmen and travellers visiting Hong Kong would not engage in activities that endanger national security and therefore would not unknowingly violate the law.

He added that a majority of the submissions received during the public consultation on the legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law were supportive and positive, reflecting a strong consensus in society for the legislation.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Department of Health on Saturday said it had ordered the Union Hospital to hand in a report after hackers attacked its computer system.

Responding to media enquiries, the department said it was notified by the hospital on Monday about the cyberattack, which affected operations.

It said initial understandings showed that the incident did not involve patients' information or affect the safety of hospital services.

The authorities said the investigation is ongoing and it had ordered the hospital to submit a detailed report within a month.

The hospital earlier said it had reported the case to the police as well as the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, and announced it had stepped up measures to prevent further attacks.

"The hospital has activated an emergency response system and stepped up cybersecurity measures to block further intrusion. A team of cyber security experts has been appointed to conduct a thorough system inspection and recovery in order to ensure medical service continuity," it wrote in a statement.]]>

    <![CDATA[Customs authorities on Saturday reported a significant increase in cannabis seizures during the first quarter of this year. 

A total of 1.28 tonnes of cannabis was seized, more than half the total seized last year.

Officers arrested 31 people, including two teenagers, suspected of being involved in drug trafficking.

Authorities have highlighted the various methods used by traffickers to smuggle cannabis, such as hiding it in pet food or secret compartments in wooden tables.

In one recent case, officers intercepted a shipment of car wheels and discovered a hidden stash of 100 kilograms of cannabis, worth about HK$23 million.

Customs officials said they would continue their efforts to enforce the law by using new technology.

They noted that cannabis has been legalised in some countries, leading to a misconception among some people that it is harmless and non-addictive.]]>

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said most people think the upcoming waste charging scheme is causing a nuisance to the public. 

The government began testing the scheme at 14 locations from this month, including at public and private residential blocks, and people involved in the trial were provided with free designated garbage bags.

Speaking on a television programme, the minister said about half of the residents living in private residential blocks participated in the test run, but only ten percent of those living in three-nil buildings joined the trial.

He added that opinions on the scheme vary.

"A few residents reflected that it's good to do waste separation and reduction. But a majority of them thought it's causing nuisance to the public because they have to pay for rubbish bags," he said.

Tse said it remains to be seen whether the scheme will go ahead as planned on August 1.

Meanwhile, the first phase of the ban on plastic tableware will start next Monday, and restaurants will be barred from selling and using disposable polystyrene tableware, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.

Asked about people reflecting that paper and wood cutlery were difficult to use, Tse said it takes time for people to get used to tableware made of different materials.

He said the catering sector may find various substitutions for plastic tableware.]]>

    <![CDATA[Liberal Party leader Tommy Cheung on Saturday expressed a positive outlook for local businesses for the upcoming Labour Day "Golden Week" holiday on the mainland. 

Cheung, who represents the catering sector, said he expects an increase in the number of mainland tourists staying overnight. 

He added that restaurants have increased their staff in anticipation of a surge in number of visitors.

"Because it's a five-day holiday for China, so I'm expecting more people to come. In fact, not just for the first of May, even second, third, fourth and fifth. I'm expecting more people coming in than going out. We are prepared for the week," he said. 

Meanwhile, Cheung expects a forthcoming ban on the sale and use of disposable plastic tableware to be implemented smoothly. 
 
He said many restaurants had already understood the new regulations and were making the necessary preparations to adapt to the changes.]]>

    <![CDATA[The chairman of the Elderly Commission on Saturday said he hopes the government can allow mainland-operated care homes to join the cross-boundary elderly care scheme. 

Under current policy, elderly people in queue for subsidised care homes in Hong Kong can apply for care homes in the nine Greater Bay Area cities on the mainland, but only those operated by Hong Kong organisations. 

Speaking on an RTHK programme, Donald Li said by expanding the scheme, the elderly can have more options, provided that a review system is enforced for quality control of service.

"Most people are concerned about the financial health of care homes, to know whether they can operate in the long term. People are also concerned about the hygiene of care homes, and whether carers received training or not. The government is doing inspections now," he said.

He admitted that the waiting time for elderly care home admission is long and urged to allocate places for those in need.]]>

    Civil service chief vows to recruit new blood

    <![CDATA[The Secretary for the Civil Service, Ingrid Yeung, has vowed to go the extra mile in hiring new public servants, while acknowledging recruitment has not been easy.

On RTHK's "Your Home Address" programme broadcast on Saturday, Yeung said the civil service workforce currently has about a 10 percent vacancy rate, due mainly to a shortage of labour in the market and the period being the peak of retirement. 

She said the administration could only hire locally, but made it clear it's working hard to recruit new blood. 

"I can trawl from the home base, I can only use local talents... Almost all employers in Hong Kong are snatching talents from each other, and the local graduates are very welcomed by employers in every sector," she said. 

"So we have to make extra efforts in recruitment and we have been making extra efforts. Last year, we have launched this scheme of allowing students in their penultimate year of study, not in their final year of study, to apply for civil service jobs as well." 

The minister also said the aim of a planned updated code of conduct for civil servants is to spell out what is expected of public workers.

"It is in the civil servants' daily work when they come into contact with different political parties, with politicians, that they should remain neutral. With regard to the government's work, with regard to what the government is doing, they should support wholeheartedly. There is no room for them to say that, 'Oh, I'm neutral, I do not support and I do not object to this government initiative.'," Yeung said. 

According to the draft Civil Service Code, which includes 12 core values and standards of conduct, civil servants must not refuse to implement government policies they do not agree with, or adopt a passive attitude in implementing them.]]>

    Insufficient load test led to DC poll glitch: EAC

    <![CDATA[A technical team behind the electronic poll register system, which failed during December's District Council polls, did not conduct sufficient load test on the programme, the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) concluded on Friday. 

In a report on the citywide polls, the watchdog also recommended the Registration and Electoral Office to identify experts in fixing the system's issues and run simulations of a large-scale election regularly. 

Last year, the glitch led to authorities extending voting hours by one and a half hours, and polling stations switching to printed copies of the voter register to issue ballot papers.

The report noted that design issues of the electronic poll register system caused the central processing unit to overload and unnecessarily tied up a substantial amount of resources in the server when electoral staff tried to log in to the programme. 

"When altering the system design, the [Registration and Electoral Office's] technical team did not fully consider the cumulative effect and impacts on loading that might be induced to the system during actual operation, and therefore did not conduct sufficient and comprehensive load test," the report said. 

The commission said the electoral office should identify suitable experts to rectify design issues and conduct "adequate, comprehensive and stringent tests", while running simulated large-scale elections on a regular basis.

"The [Registration and Electoral Office] should learn a lesson from this system failure, and actively implement the above recommendations to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents in future," it said. 

"As to whether any individual officers should be held responsible for the incident, it will be followed up by the administration according to the established procedures."]]>
