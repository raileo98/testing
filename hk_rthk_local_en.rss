    <![CDATA[The culture, sports and tourism minister, Kevin Yeung, on Monday said it was unacceptable that repeated mistakes were made by the chairwoman of the city's weightlifting and powerlifting body. 

He also called on Josephine Ip of the Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association to publicly address her mistakes. 

"It is unacceptable for the same mistakes to happen over and over. We hope that the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China can come up with a long-term solution so that similar incidents won't happen again," Yeung said.

"Because in both instances the chairwoman was at fault, she should explain to the public herself."

The association had apologised for a remark made by Ip during a competition on May 6. The event featured competitors from 13 countries along with the SAR and Chinese Taipei, and Ip said it had "lifters and officials from 13 countries".

Her remark drew condemnation from the administration on Friday, which called Ip's remarks "absolutely unacceptable".

"The statement is grossly inconsistent with the fact that delegations from Hong Kong, China and Chinese Taipei participated as regional teams. It gives rise to suspected violation of the one-China principle," a government spokesperson said in a statement.

The sports body explained the chairwoman made the blunder with the intention of simplifying a long sentence while giving a speech at the opening ceremony of the Asian Equipped Powerlifting Championship and the Asian University Cup.

On another occasion, she described Hong Kong as a "relatively small country", which the association said was a "slip of the tongue".

The minister said the administration would take appropriate action based on findings of the investigation to ensure people speaking on behalf of a sports association or the sector understood that every single word is very important.

The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, for its part, said it is reviewing the report submitted by the weightlifting and powerlifting body and would keep in contact with the government how to handle the matter.]]>

    <![CDATA[London's Metropolitan Police on Monday said three men were charged with allegedly assisting Hong Kong intelligence services and with foreign interference.

The men have appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged under Britain's National Security Act.

Chi Leung Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, have each been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service. They were not asked to enter any pleas to the charges and will next appear in court on May 24. All three men were granted bail.

Seven men and one woman who were not charged were released from custody, police added.

The Chinese Embassy in the UK said it has made serious representations to UK officials over the matter.

"The Chinese side firmly rejects and strongly condemns the UK’s fabrication of the so-called case and its unwarranted accusation against the HKSAR government," it said in a statement.

The SAR Government said it had "demanded the UK Government to provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter concerned, and the latter's response is awaited".

"The duties of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London are to maintain close liaison with interlocutors in the local government, business, think tanks and various sectors, with a view to enriching bilateral ties in different areas such as trade, investment, arts and culture, enhancing local people and enterprises' knowledge of Hong Kong's unique strengths, and promoting the economic and trade interests of Hong Kong," it said in a statement.

It said it had demanded that London "fairly handle the matter, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office's Office Manager who was alleged to be involved, and ensure that the normal work of the Economic and Trade Office is not affected".

London police said a total of 11 people had been detained earlier this month, nearly all of whom were arrested in the Yorkshire area in northern England.

A police spokesman said, “this investigation remains ongoing, but now that charges have been brought, I urge people not to speculate or comment further in relation to this case.” (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[Police on Monday said they arrested 34 people for allegedly operating electric bikes and scooters without a licence.

The suspects, aged between 19 and 69, were also charged with offences such as driving unlicensed vehicles and using them on pavements.

Officers added that they seized 34 electric bikes and scooters in various areas in the New Territories, such as Tuen Mun, Yuen Long and Lok Ma Chau, in a two-day operation last week.

Speaking at a press briefing, senior inspector Ngai Siu-Cheong reminded people not to use unlicensed electric vehicles on public roads.

"Anyone using unregistered and unlicensed electric vehicles on the road may be in violation of the Road Users' Code and other relevant laws. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty includes a fine of HK$10,000 and 12-month imprisonment," he said.]]>

    Take care of ethnic minority Chinese tourists too: DAB

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's tourism industry should learn to be more accommodating to ethnic minority travellers from the mainland, DAB lawmakers said on Monday, after the central government announced it was adding eight more cities to the individual visit scheme.

From May 27, residents from eight more cities – including Hohhot of Inner Mongolia, Lhasa of Tibet, and Urumqi of Xinjiang – will be able to visit Hong Kong without joining tour groups. 

Lawmaker Kennedy Wong pointed out the expansion meant more mainland visitors who are from ethnic minority communities coming to Hong Kong, including Mongolians, Zhuang people, and Hui people, and that the SAR had to be prepared to welcome them. 

"Hong Kong's tourism industry, and actually every one of us here, should be more accommodating and should be more understanding towards the minority travellers' needs. For example, for Muslims and for Mongolians, they have their eating habits and they also have their own culture," Wong said. 

"Some of these minority travellers probably prefer their own languages. Apart from the ability to speak Putonghua, perhaps in some signage and some areas we also need to display their languages too." 

Starry Lee, another DAB legislator and also Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, urged officials to consider arranging more direct flights from those mainland cities. 

There are currently direct flights from just four of these newly added cities – Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, and Urumqi, with airlines planning to add Harbin next month. 
 
Lee also renewed calls for Beijing to raise the duty-free goods allowance for mainland tourists from 5,000 to 30,000 yuan per person for each trip, while capping the amount at 200,000 yuan.]]>

    <![CDATA[Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun said on Monday there was "nothing political" about him saying the governance of the statutory body overseeing social workers must be improved, and that the motivation was about raising the sector's professional standards. 

Last Friday, he wrote on social media accusing the Social Workers Registration Board of ignoring society's overall interests, damaging the professionalism and credibility of the sector by deviating from the spirit of the law.

Specifically, he wrote that the board had renewed the licences or approved licence applications of people who'd committed serious offences in the past, while approving a social worker facing a rioting charge to join its disciplinary committee panel.

The minister said improvements must be made to implement the principle of patriots administering Hong Kong.

Currently, the board has 15 members - eight of whom are elected, with six appointed and an official from the Social Welfare Department.

Speaking to reporters, Sun didn't say whether the government plans to appoint more members to the board. 

He said it would announce its reform package once it's ready.

Sun also dismissed an argument from the board's chairman, Ng Yut-ming, that the minister had misunderstandings regarding how the board operates.

"There's no misunderstanding - I have complete information about what's going on in the board," the minister said.

Social welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said he hopes the board won't become a political battlefield.

Tik said that if the government decides to go ahead and add more appointed members, he hoped it wouldn’t be because it wanted to gain the majority of the board and exert greater influence.

The lawmaker also proposed that future appointed members be nominated or recommended by universities or professional bodies as they'd be considered impartial.

"If you want to improve the registration board, it has to include the element of professionalism," he said.

"I suggest that the scholars from the universities or members of the professional body would increase the content and element of professionalism. I also imagine it will be more easily accepted by our professional sector."

Tik hoped that officials would consult social workers regarding the reform proposal in future.]]>

    Community living rooms to open in summer: Chris Sun

    <![CDATA[Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Monday said he hopes the community living rooms in To Kwa Wan, Hung Hom and Nam Cheong would open by the end of the summer holidays, as part of efforts to help the newly identified 950,000 people for targeted poverty alleviation.

Speaking at a Legco panel meeting, Sun hoped the three facilities, aimed at providing support for grassroots families, would be able to serve residents in summer after undergoing outfitting works.

Lawmaker Connie Lam asked whether there were plans to expand the shared-space project to more districts to help more people living in poor conditions.  

“Apart from subdivided unit households, people living in cages or caged homes and cubicles also need these kind of community living rooms. There are a lot of such kinds of residential developments in Sha Tin, in Lohas Park in Tseung Kwan O, there are also subdivided units…Will the government expand the programme to other districts?” she asked.

In response, Sun said it’s not easy for the government to identify locations for these living rooms. 

“Subdivided unit households are concentrated in urban areas and as a result it's difficult for the government to identify a venue to establish a community living room. That is why we have to rely on the business sector to identify such a venue for us,” he said.

At the same meeting, lawmakers also questioned whether a new framework for poverty measurement could reflect the actual poverty situation and target underprivileged groups.

The government identified around 950,000 elderly people, single-parent households and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation. It will no longer use median household income to define poverty.

Welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said officials shouldn’t scrap the poverty line because it can keep the public informed about the impoverished population.

“Of course, the poverty line is contentious elsewhere in the world, but the poverty line works in two ways — we can tell the trend; we can see whether the impoverished population is growing or shrinking. The poverty line can also help us keep an eye on the performance of the government,” he said.

The welfare chief responded by saying the government had been putting a lot of resources into poverty alleviation through various social welfare programmes.]]>

    <![CDATA[The DAB on Monday called on the government to clarify its revised rules on employment agencies, saying they were unclear. 

The party's comments came after the Labour Department released a revised code of practice last week which aims to discourage domestic helpers from "job hopping", and to safeguard consumer rights.

Speaking at a press briefing, DAB lawmaker Frankie Ngan urged authorities to better stipulate the measure.

"The DAB requests the government to do more promotion and education for the agencies, especially as it is a new regulation for them," he said

"Could the government implement the instruction for the employer and the employee at the same time to make sure that they deeply understand the new regulation for the agency and the new agreement?"

Ngan also called on the government to limit the borrowing capacity of foreign domestic helpers, as he and other DAB party members have received complaints from employers who are frustrated by lenders who pursue the money that helpers failed to pay back before departing from Hong Kong.

"We request the government [to] make a financial credit database for those financial institutes to see [how much a] particular domestic helper borrowed," he said.

"We request the government to consider, [to] set an upper limit for the borrowing loan to the domestic helpers."

The DAB also suggested the government introduce a tax reduction scheme for people hiring foreign domestic helpers to reduce their burden on arranging health checks and training classes for the helpers.]]>

    <![CDATA[Representatives of the retail and hotel industries on Monday praised the move to boost Hong Kong's tourism sector by adding eight mainland cities to the individual visit scheme, but views were divided on whether direct flights from those cities were necessary.

From May 27, travellers from Taiyuan in Shanxi Province, Hohhot of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Harbin in Heilongjiang, Lhasa in Tibet, Lanzhou in Gansu, Xining in Qinghai, Yinchuan in Ningxia, and Urumqi in Xinjiang will be able to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis, instead of on tour groups.

Currently, there are direct flights from just four cities - Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, and Urumqi, with airlines planning to add Harbin next month.

Alan Chan from the Miramar Group, which owns two hotels in the city, said travellers from further afield tend to spend more money, adding that tourists from the eight cities would be a big boost to the tourism sector here.

"Visitors from those eight places will be the most wealthy people there...there are rich people in every city. For example, Shanxi doesn't have a very strong economy but there are bosses who own coal businesses there," the group's chief operations officer told an RTHK programme.

He said with a new road which links Shenzhen airport and Shenzhen Bay opening next month, it would be convenient for mainland travellers to come to the SAR even if there are no direct flights.

But Liberal Party legislator Peter Shiu, who represents the retail sector, said businesses here would get a greater boost if there are direct flights from all eight cities.

"If tourists fly to Hong Kong directly, they would spend the night here during their trip. But if they fly to Shenzhen first and then come to Hong Kong, will they spend some time in Shenzhen before visiting us, or come to Hong Kong during the day and spend the night in Shenzhen?" he said.

"We have to think about this because usually tourists who stay the night here spend more money than those who don't."]]>

    HA looks to make it easier to add new medicines

    <![CDATA[The Hospital Authority (HA) said it is seeking to streamline the process for adding new drugs to its registry, with a view to cut half the time needed to obtain the medicines.

Currently, drug companies write to clinical doctors directly in the application, and it takes around 10 months before a drug could be added to the HA's formulary.

The authority’s cluster services director, Simon Tang, said officials are trying to cut the red tape by having companies write to its headquarters, saving front-line doctors time and effort.

He said patient groups and public doctors are among stakeholders officials will speak to, saying he hopes they can work out a proposal in the coming months.

"We need to get our colleagues involved, and of course, another key stakeholder would be the pharmaceutical companies," Tang told reporters.

"Through the streamlining, we're confident that the introduction of new drugs to the HA drug formulary can be shortened by half."

In November last year, the government introduced a new mechanism called "1+" for new drug registrations, for products treating severe diseases that are backed by local clinical data.

A new drug can now be registered in the SAR if just one drug regulatory authority in the world has approved it, rather than the previous two authorities, before local experts and regulators approve it.

Tang said the HA had so far asked drug companies to try to register two drugs for treating cancer through the new mechanism, and said he understood that the government itself had received around 100 enquiries on the matter.

He added that if the safety-proving clinical data for the new product is from the mainland or Hong Kong that could better ensure its effectiveness, because sometimes drugs approved in other continents may not have similar effects or side-effects for Asians. 

The doctor noted that mainland drug regulators were one of four authorities added to the list of regulatory bodies in recent years.]]>

    <![CDATA[Mainland students studying in Hong Kong have been urged to be vigilant as more of them are being targeted by phone scammers. 

Senior inspector Eddie Lam said there were 39 cases of mainland students falling victim to fake-official ruses in the first quarter of this year, up from 29 cases during the same period last year.

"We discovered that scammers are targeting mainlanders who are studying in Hong Kong. We found that the number of reports by mainland students increased rapidly in April," he said.

Lam said students, especially those from the mainland, should be extra vigilant.

From January to March, phone-scam victims lost a total of HK$789 million, almost four times more than the amount swindled during the same period last year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Around a hundred Hongkongers who’ve mastered the art of doing nothing on Sunday gathered at the Cha Kwo Ling Promenade for a zoning out contest. 

The “Chill and Relax Festival” is jointly organised by the Development Bureau, the Harbourfront Commission and the Playground Association to raise awareness over the importance of mental health.

Participants were advised to stay still, and must not fall asleep or check their phones during the hour-long tournament. Their heart rates were measured regularly, and the person with the lowest and most stable heart rate would win. 

Kelvin, a laboratory worker, described the challenge as “a piece of cake”. 

“A whole hour is nothing. I normally can do nothing for a few hours daily, so I think it is not that challenging. Practice makes perfect,” he said. 

Moris, a university student, said he was there to take a break from his studies. 

“Just to relax, honestly… because I completed my semester. I think [I am here] just for this atmosphere because it shows some, it's a symbol for difference, like the traditional China culture or the Buddha,” he said.

Winnie, who joined the event with a group of hiking friends, said the occasion was perfect for Hongkongers to relax.

“The majority of Hongkongers are always stressed out. So having some time to relax like this competition will be better,” she told RTHK. 

The top three candidates got an Apple Watch, Airpods and a HK$500 shopping coupon respectively.]]>

    <![CDATA[Celebrations are underway across Hong Kong on Sunday to mark Mother's Day. 

Some restaurants RTHK spoke to said they logged a jump in business, as families flocked out to celebrate the day. 

Others, meanwhile, bought flowers as a show of love and appreciation for their mothers. 

"By giving her flowers, I would say thank you to my mom for taking care of me over the years and helping me," 11-year-old Alex said. 

Some tourists said they were quite impressed with the festivities. 

Mrs Wong, a tourist from Singapore, said people in Hong Kong appear to be more excited about Mother's Day compared to her home country. 

"I think the culture here in Hong Kong is pretty interesting. It's a bit different from Singapore, because I do see a lot of people carrying flowers around, so it's a bit different. So, I think they place more emphasis in Hong Kong,” she said. 

Another visitor from Shenzhen, Mr Tien, said he and his family are here for a day trip to mark the occasion. 

"We come to Hong Kong for traveling and shopping, and brought our kid to walk around," he said.

Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee wished all mothers joy and happiness on this special day. 

The CE also posted a photo of himself and a colleague preparing flowers for "the two great mothers" in his life – namely his own mother and his wife – for the sacrifices they've made for his family.]]>

    <![CDATA[The government's plan to allow non-locally trained nurses to practise in Hong Kong without taking a licensing exam has its drawbacks, a lawmaker and a nursing professor said on Sunday.

Instead, they said it's more important to take away administrative work from existing local nurses at public hospitals and recognise their specialty to retain staff.

Currently, non-locally trained nurses must pass the licensing examination administered by the Nursing Council of Hong Kong to be a qualified practitioner here.

But under the government’s proposal which has been submitted to Legco for scrutiny, those trained outside of the city could come through a special registration pathway and obtain a full license, without taking the exam, after having worked “satisfactorily and competently” during a specified period in the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority.

Marking the International Nurses Day, DAB lawmaker Edward Leung noted that the attrition rate for nurses in the public sector reached 9.5 percent in 2023-24, saying the government must improve working conditions to keep staff. 

He said it’s important to reduce their administrative burden and ensure their pay is on par with the private sector.

He said while the plan to admit non-locally trained nurses could help alleviate manpower shortage at public hospitals in the longer run, it could add to the workload of local nurses in the initial phase. 

"When we invite them to Hong Kong, in the very first period, we have to assign local nurses to assist them on doing their jobs and providing services. For this period, we are drawing manpower to assist the non-local nurses," Leung said. 

William Li, vice-president of the Hong Kong Academy of Nursing, said the proposed special registration would only be a temporary measure to alleviate manpower shortage in the public sector. 

“The most important way is to offer recognition to those nurses who have specialty experience or specialty nursing qualification," Li said.

"Eventually, their job satisfaction should be improved and more nurses would be happy to stay at public hospitals." 

Li also said offering more training spots for aspiring nurses at local institutions could be another way to alleviate manpower shortage.]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said an expansion of the individual travellers scheme will bring more overnight tourists to the SAR, adding that more will be done to boost spending and attract visitors. 

He made the remarks a day after Beijing announced that people from eight more mainland cities – including Hohhot of Inner Mongolia, Lhasa of Tibet, and Urumqi of Xinjiang – will be able to visit Hong Kong without joining tour groups. 

This brings the total number of cities under the solo travel scheme to 59.  

Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the move will stimulate the economy and improve cultural ties between the SAR and the mainland. 

"The SAR government and residents are deeply grateful to the central government for their support of Hong Kong. The move will encourage more visitors to stay overnight, boosting the local catering, retail, and hotel sectors," he wrote. 

"This will help our economy and improve the cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong." 
 
The finance chief also vowed to do more to lure talent to the city, and bring in more foreign capital. 

Despite the external challenges like rising geopolitical tensions and a high interest rate environment, Chan said he’s confident that Hong Kong’s economy will continue to expand with the staunch backing of the central authorities.]]>

    'Glory to HK' ban helps define red line: Paul Lam

    <![CDATA[Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said an injunction over the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong" helps define the red line and provides a stronger deterrence against those who would use the song as a tool to promote "Hong Kong independence".

Speaking on a radio programme days after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order banning the song, Lam said the court has made it very clear what is allowed and what’s not. 

"The purpose of this injunction was made very clear by the court. Using this song to incite seditious acts is illegal. It will definitely increase the public's awareness of this behaviour. What are the benefits? They are to provide a stronger deterrence and a prevention, and to make everyone understand what can and can't be done," he said.  

The justice chief said authorities had asked internet service providers such as Google to take down the song and are awaiting their response, adding that Google had said earlier that it would remove the song upon a court order.  

"I believe everyone is very anxious and hope that [the internet service providers] will take actual action to respond as quickly as possible. Do they really follow the company’s policy [to align with court orders]? Do they really keep their word?" he questioned. 

Meanwhile, Lam said he hopes to see Hong Kong develop into a “food court” for legal services, catering not only for the needs of international companies, but also of grassroots citizens. 

The justice minister added that officials will continue to boost the city’s role as a mediation and arbitration centre.]]>

    Weightlifting body apologises over chairwoman remarks

    <![CDATA[The city's weightlifting and powerlifting body has apologised for an earlier remark made by its chairwoman which the government said was a suspected violation of the one-China principle.

The Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association also said Josephine Ip made the blunder with the intention of simplifying a long sentence when giving a speech on May 6.

At the opening ceremony of the Asian Equipped Powerlifting Championship and the Asian University Cup, Ip mentioned that the event, which featured competitors from the SAR and Chinese Taipei, had "lifters and officials from 13 countries". 

Her remarks drew condemnation from the administration on Friday, which called Ip's remarks "absolutely unacceptable".

"The statement is grossly inconsistent with the fact that delegations from Hong Kong, China and Chinese Taipei participated as regional teams. It gives rise to suspected violation of the one-China principle," a government spokesperson said in a statement. 

In response, the sports body explained that there were initially competitors from 16 countries and regions, but ultimately only representatives from 13 nations and two regions participated in the event. 

"During her speech, chairwoman Ip found that the script did not match the actual number of participating teams. She also felt that the sentence was too long. So she simplified the sentence to 'this time, we have lifters and officials from 13 countries'," the association said. 

"She mistakenly omitted 'regions' and created misunderstanding. This was a serious oversight." 

The association also said the speech did not mean to imply "Hong Kong independence", and that it firmly supports and upholds the Basic Law and the one-China principle. 

The chairwoman will be more cautious and will review public speeches before giving them to ensure similar incidents won't happen again, the association added. 

The powerlifting and weightlifting association has submitted a report to the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China on Saturday.]]>

    <![CDATA[The SAR government on Saturday condemned a report by the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China.

In a statement, the administration said the commission’s “so-called ‘2023 Annual Report’ ... made biased, slandering and smearing remarks against the situation in the HKSAR”.

The SAR government rejected the report’s comments on safeguarding national security; the administration of justice and rule of law; safeguarding of rights and freedoms and reform of the district councils. 

A government spokesperson said: “The US is once again overriding the rule of law with politics and making unfounded and fact-twisting remarks. Such attempt to undermine the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance is doomed to fail.”

On calls in the report for sanctions on SAR officials, judges and prosecutors, the spokesperson added: “The so-called 'sanctions' as mentioned in the US' so-called report is a smack of despicable political manipulation to intimidate the HKSAR officials safeguarding national security.

“These grossly interfere in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs, and violate the international law and the basic norms governing international relations.”

On calls for the SAR’s economic and trade offices in the US to lose their certification, the spokesperson added: “The HKSAR Government despised the hypocrisy and barbaric act of US politicians driven only by their own political gains, fabricating groundless excuses, and attacking the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices' legitimate and rational economic and trade promotion activities.”

The statement says the SAR government will “steadfastly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and fully and faithfully lives up to the highest principle of 'one country, two systems'.”]]>

    <![CDATA[Large crowds of visitors and locals flocked to the Wan Chai waterfront on Saturday for the first in a series of spectacular drone shows put on by the Tourism Board.

About one thousand drones took flight at 8pm for the ten-minute spectacular, which is designed to tie in with the Buddha's Birthday public holiday and the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, both of which fall on Wednesday.

The drones soared up to sixty metres into the air, creating a pattern in the shape of the famous bun hill which is the centrepiece of the Cheung Chau festival's highlight, the bun-scrambling competition. They also formed the shape of what organisers called a "giant peaceful bun" some 30 metres in diameter.

Many of the spectators captured the moment on their smartphones and cameras.

Other shapes adopted included lions and temples to signify good luck.

And visitors to the show were also in luck: for those waiting to enjoy the drones, there was free ice cream at the Wan Chai Ferry Pier.]]>
