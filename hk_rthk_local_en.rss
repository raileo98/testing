    <![CDATA[Police on Thursday said they believe a suspected burglar, who died after being found unconscious at Lantau's Sea Ranch, had fallen from height. 

Officers said the mainland man, who's 37, crossed the border on a two-way permit on Tuesday. 

They suspect he was part of a gang of three burgling homes at the isolated resort.

Residents from five homes reported that their place had been broken into, with HK$7,000 and some cigarettes missing. 

Police said two of the suspects had returned to the mainland on Wednesday, and they would seek help from their mainland counterparts if needed.

Officers said they found a trail of blood from one of the blocks at the resort, adding the deceased had a blow to his head, with his jaw and teeth broken.

An autopsy would be conducted to establish the cause of death.

Officers added they had received four reports of burglary at Sea Ranch since last December, and investigations were ongoing. No arrests have been made over those cases so far.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Thursday said it had started criminal proceedings against hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its founder, director and chief investment officer Simon Sadler, and former trader Daniel La Rocca for the offence of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company prior to a block trade in June 2017.

In a statement, the SFC said the two defendants appeared at Eastern Magistrates' Court on Thursday and the case was adjourned to June 12.

Sadler, a British businessman, is also the owner of Blackpool Football Club which competes in England's EFL League One division.

Established in 2007, Segantii is one of the oldest and biggest hedge funds in Asia. 

Apart from Hong Kong, it also has operations in London, New York and Dubai, according to its website.

In a statement on its website, Blackpool Football Club said the charges were entirely unrelated to the club, and its day-to-day operations would not be affected.

"We understand that Mr Sadler will vigorously defend himself against the charge, and there will be no further comments at the time from the Club," the statement added. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

    <![CDATA[Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) is launching a series of new programmes from May, covering topics from news and current affairs to youth, family, and community activities, as well as education and culture.

The new programmes will be broadcast across RTHK's eight channels.

Speaking at the launch ceremony on Thursday, RTHK’s assistant director, Vincent Lee, said RTHK is committed to innovative production, nurturing new talent, and recruiting skilled individuals. 

He noted that over 80 new employees joined the public broadcaster following multiple rounds of civil service recruitment conducted in recent months. 

Lee added that pure audio content was no longer sufficient to meet the needs of the public and the broadcaster would utilise more advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to visualise radio programmes and distribute content across different platforms to reach a wider audience.

Meanwhile, he said RTHK’s productions would deepen its connection with the mainland to tell good stories of Hong Kong and China - as 2024 marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

RTHK would also provide comprehensive coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics, as well as the 2025 National Games, through television, radio, and new media platforms, Lee added.

RTHK's director of broadcasting Eddie Cheung, vice chairman of the Board of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority Bernard Chan and chairman of RTHK Board of Advisors Lam Tai-fai also attended the ceremony.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Inland Revenue Department on Thursday said it expects a 12 percent increase in the amount of tax it collects this year, following a drop last year.

Provisional figures show the department collected HK$342 billion in the last tax year, which was HK$18.2 billion or about five percent lower than in 2022-23. 

But it said it expects tax revenue to rise to HK$382 billion this year.

The department said stamp duty revenue is likely to hit HK$71 billion this year, following a 30 percent decrease to HK$49.1 billion last year.

Commissioner of Inland Revenue Tam Tai-pang noted that the city's "spicy" property cooling measures were scrapped in February. 

"The year 2023-24 had seen a significant drop in property market transactions... and that contributed largely to a significant drop in the stamp duty collections for the year," he said.

"We understand that after the abolition of all the demand-side management measures for residential properties, there's a notable increase in property transactions."

The department said it has sent out about 2.44 million tax returns for individuals for the 2023-24 financial year. People have until June 3 to post them back, or until July 3 if the returns are filed via e-Tax.]]>

    <![CDATA[Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Thursday said the pay-as-you-throw trial would continue this month as planned, despite feedback that cleaners and participants are having a hard time with the scheme.

The government selected 14 buildings and premises to test the waste-charging scheme, which began last month, with participants using designated garbage bags and tags to dispose of their rubbish.

The government had earlier delayed the scheme's full rollout from April to August.

On Wednesday, Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Warner Cheuk, said that there were still many problems with the trial, and that there must be "public consensus and favourable conditions" to roll out the scheme smoothly.

Tse said officials were aware the scheme had increased the workload of cleaners and that some participants found it troublesome, adding the government would carefully look into these matters.

He said they would faithfully report these issues to lawmakers at a meeting planned before the end of this month.

"The waste charging scheme really affects the whole population," the minister said after attending an event.

"How can we implement it so that everyone can accept it, and people won’t find it too much of a disruption, so the scheme can run smoothly -- these are all things we need to think about." 

Separately, the minister said a six-month grace period for restaurants to continue giving out single-use plastic utensils should be long enough.

From April 22, eateries had to switch to alternative utensils, but they can still give out plastic containers for takeaways.

Tse said those who had yet to switch had told officials they were trying to clear their plastic stock, or were waiting for the alternatives to arrive.

He said officials would visit smaller eateries in the coming months to see if they need any help.]]>

    Consumer Council criticised over privacy breach

    <![CDATA[Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung on Thursday criticised the Consumer Council over a data breach last year, saying the watchdog contravened the Personal Data Ordinance with its deficiencies.

An attack by hackers resulted in the leak of personal data on more than 450 individuals, including staff members and people who filed complaints with the council.

Chung's office said the council started allowing staff to connect to its server using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) when work-from-home arrangements were introduced during the pandemic.

But the council failed to enable multi-factor authentication for the remote access and a hacker group obtained the credentials of a user account before deploying ransomware in the council's servers and endpoints.

At a press briefing, Chung said the council had not taken all practicable steps to protect personal data.
 
"The protection given by this multi-factor authentication would be enhanced to over 99 percent if this feature is enabled," she said.

Chung added that two weeks passed before the council realised there had been a breach.

"The cybersecurity solution was supposed to send an email alert to the council once it detected any cybersecurity attack. However, in this case, after the incident the council discovered that the cybersecurity solution was not properly configured," she said. 

"That was why even though it detected the attack in question, it did not send any email alert to the council for this particular incident, and that was why the council only discovered the cyberattack on September 20 [last year]."

The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has served an enforcement notice on the council and has ordered it to submit proof within two months that it has adopted improvement measures.

In response, the council said it attaches great importance to cybersecurity and has adopted various measures since the incident. 

"[The measures include] enabling multi-factor authentication for remote data access via VPN, conducting a comprehensive review of the cybersecurity solutions' functions and appropriate settings, and further strengthening internal training to enhance staff's awareness and behaviour on cybersecurity," it said in a statement.]]>

    Govt should improve public housing: think tank

    <![CDATA[A think tank on Thursday urged the government to improve the quality of public housing as supply catches up with demand.

The Our Hong Kong Foundation said it expects the average waiting time for a public flat to fall from the current 5.8 years to 4.6 years by 2027.

The foundation’s vice president, Ryan Ip, said 35,000 units are expected to be completed each year in the next five years, exceeding the government's long-term target of 30,800.

"The total completion of public housing in the next 10 years, no matter which scenarios, it can fulfil the government's own targets. So, with this overall background, then we can sort of move from quantity to the quality side," he said.

"So, first of all, we advocate for a steadily increasing of the size of housing units of public housing in the next five to 10 years.”

As for private housing, Ip said the supply will remain stable even though the government saw a record six failed land tenders last year.]]>

    Shoppers delight amid weak yen

    <![CDATA[With the ongoing slump in the yen which sank to a new 34-year low earlier this week, Japan has seen an influx of Hongkongers taking advantage of the weaker currency and snapping up everything from designer goods to daily necessities.

On Monday, the yen fell to 160 to the US dollar before recovering. The Japanese currency was down some 10 percent since the start of the year and 30 percent from three years ago.

Many Hong Kong travellers have been visiting Japan since the end of the pandemic, and the trend is not about to end anytime soon.

“The yen is very cheap right now, so it’s a great time to go shopping here,” said Maggie Kwong, a Hong Kong banking professional who went to Tokyo for her second trip to Japan this year.

“For example, I went to buy a pair of running shoes... Usually the shoes would cost around HK$1,000, but I was able to buy it for just under HK$500 for the same pair of shoes. 

"So definitely, the fact that the yen has weakened has given me more motivation to come visit Japan and to spend more."

Steve Huen, executive director of EGL Tours, told RTHK that the number of Hongkongers travelling to Japan was up 20 percent in both March and April compared with a year ago.

But he said a weaker yen does not necessarily mean cheaper tours, citing higher demand not only from Hong Kong but also around the world, especially North America, with a record three million foreign holidaymakers in Japan in March.

Huen also said Japanese people who opted to travel domestically instead of overseas added to demand.

Still, he said Hongkongers find prices to be attractive.

“A ramen index also suggested that a ramen in Japan now costs about HK$50, versus the about HK$120 to HK$150 in Central in Hong Kong," he said.

There has been speculation that Tokyo has intervened to prop up the currency.

“An actual intervention would be authorities directly selling US dollars and buying the yen in the foreign exchange markets to support the yen, but the impact from such an intervention will be rather short-lived because the foreign exchange reserves that the Japanese government holds are limited,” Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank, said.

“It will not change the yen’s weakness in the long term, before the US Federal Reserve starts to cut interest rates later this year."

He expects the yen to remain at about 150 to 160 against the greenback for some time.

“This will give travellers from Hong Kong an advantage to visit Japan, but it will make the Hong Kong inbound tourism recovery even slower due to the linked exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar,” Cheung noted.]]>

    <![CDATA[The executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, on Thursday said tourist figures for the first day of the mainland's Golden Week holiday were in line with expectations.  

The Immigration Department said arrivals in the SAR exceeded 460,000 on May 1, including around 180,000 from the mainland. 

Some tourists complained on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu that bad weather marred a fireworks show over Victoria Harbour on Wednesday evening. 

Chui told an RTHK programme that he thinks the visitor numbers would have been even higher if the weather had been better.   

"Indeed, some people joked that they didn't just see the fireworks but smoke as well. I believe this is to do with the weather. But I think visitors who came to Hong Kong were generally satisfied. It's very common to say a few words on social media platforms," he said. 
 
Echoing his views, wholesale and retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu said items such as jewellery and cosmetics were popular among tourists on May 1. 

Shiu added that he hopes the government will continue to improve publicity for mega events and support airlines to beef up their flight capacity.]]>

    New flu trend detection model for better vaccines

    <![CDATA[A Chinese University researcher said a new computing model could help the authorities make better choices in selecting the strain of flu they vaccinate people against. 

Health officials have to choose which vaccine to order ahead of each flu season. 

Maggie Wang, who developed the new model, known as beth-1, with colleagues from the Faculty of Medicine, said it could predict how the virus would change in the future.

She said the model would give authorities early warnings of emerging virus variants, particularly for the H3N2 virus, the H1N1 virus and the influenza B virus. 

"This information is particularly important for the WHO (World Health Organisation) because each year or each season, the next season's influenza vaccine strain should be determined earlier, that is almost nine to 12 months ahead of the target season. A prediction model can provide critical information to inform the decision makers of the optimal vaccine strain to select," she said. 

"For pharmaceutical companies, the forecasting model is also very useful because the manufacturing of the influenza vaccine has a really compact timeline. So earlier prediction can give more time and the buffer for the manufacturers to prepare the vaccine development and manufacturing."

Wang added that their research team has already been working closely with institutions in the mainland to conduct animal experiments for manufacturing more effective vaccines using the beth-1 model.

"We did the prospective validation using mice model. That is, we predict the next season, the future season's representative viral strain, and then use this strain to make the vaccine to immunize the mice, and we also immunize another group of mice using the current vaccines," she said. 

"And after a few months, when the target season comes, we collect the circulating viruses from the Prince of Wales Hospital, and then use this circulating virus to challenge the immunized mice, and compare how strongly antibody response in these two groups of mice. The outcome is that our model-predicted strain generates significantly higher, or non-inferior neutralization titer, antibody response against the circulating viruses."]]>

    <![CDATA[Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk on Wednesday said a trial has shown that there are still many problems with the government's long-delayed waste charging programme.

The pay-as-you-throw scheme was tested at 14 locations from last month, covering homes, shops and restaurants, but only about half of the households participated by using designated bags to dispose of trash.

Cheuk said a working group had been meeting every week to discuss the plan.

"According to our initial observations, there are many problems. We think that if we introduce the waste charging scheme, we must have a consensus and support from Hong Kong people," he said.

"That's because this policy directly affects the seven million people in Hong Kong. There must be favourable conditions in various areas in order to roll the scheme out smoothly."

Officials had earlier said it remained to be seen whether a full rollout would go ahead on August 1 as planned.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Tourism Board on Wednesday said an 8pm pyrotechnic display over Victoria Harbour will go ahead as planned. 

The show had been in doubt because of inclement weather, but the board says forecasts show it's fine to go ahead, warning people attending to bring rain gear and check the conditions.

It's good news for tourists in town for the Labour Day holiday who had been anxiously checking the weather ahead of the fireworks show, which is the first in a series planned to mark holidays and festivals.

A tourist, who is making a three-day trip from Zhejiang province, said it is her first time in Hong Kong and she really wants to see the fireworks.

"I really want to see it...I think the scene will be fascinating. I've watched similar shows on the mainland, but I think that may be different in Hong Kong," she told RTHK.

And some mainland tourists said they would not be staying overnight because of the high prices for hotels during the holiday.

"We will go back to Shenzhen at night, but we may come again on Friday. The price of a hotel room in Shenzhen is just a third of that in Hong Kong. That's a huge difference," a tourist said.

The Immigration Department said as of 4pm, there were about 237,000 tourist arrivals, and that includes nearly 140,000 mainland tourists.

    <![CDATA[The Observatory is verifying social media posts which apparently showed hail falling in Hong Kong as the city was hit with storms overnight.

During an amber warning issued at about 9.30pm on Tuesday, posts from several social media platforms reported that hail was falling in Yuen Long. One video on Instagram showed residents there running for cover.

The Observatory said it is verifying the social media posts, and noted that there were reports of hail fall from Macau and Zhuhai.

“Last year, there were also hail reports in March and April,” Betty Mak, a scientific officer at the Observatory, told RTHK, noting that there is nothing unusual for it to hail this time of year.

“We’ll consider all the data and observations including the stability of the atmosphere and analysis of radar images and hail reports from nearby areas or locally to assess."

“Members of the public should consider bringing rain gear when going out,” Mak added.

The forecaster also said lightning struck the east of the territory more than 6,400 times between 10pm and 10am. “Violent gusts” of over 100km per hour were also recorded in Cheung Chau early on Wednesday morning.

Meanwhile, a concert that was being held in Central was forced to stop midway when the amber signal came into effect on Tuesday night.

And several flights were affected by the weather, with some being delayed or rerouted to land in other airports in the Pearl River Delta area.

    'More weight on GDP growth needed for minimum wage'

    <![CDATA[The chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Wednesday said authorities should give more weight to the growth of the SAR's economy in a new formula for calculating the minimum wage.

The Executive Council on Tuesday approved recommendations to review the minimum wage every year instead of every two years, and under the new mechanism, the minimum wage would not be reduced.

The new formula will take into account the consumer price index and 20 percent of the difference between the previous year’s GDP figure and economic growth in the past decade, with a cap of one percentage point.

FTU chairman Kingsley Wong welcomed the change, but he said the hourly minimum wage would only increase by about HK$1 every year under the new mechanism, which is not ideal.

"Grassroots workers should also be able to share the results of economic prosperity. It's too low to only include [20 percent of the GDP growth difference]. This is what the mechanism is short of," he told an RTHK radio programme.

"We hope that employers, employees, officials and scholars should review the mechanism, for example, in every five years."

He said calculations should include 30 percent of the GDP growth difference instead.

Speaking on the same programme, the president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, Simon Wong, said the catering sector will not see a huge increase in operating costs because of the new mechanism.

"Under the labour shortage situation, the hourly wage for the catering sector is a lot higher than the minimum wage... For temporary positions, restaurants mostly have to pay workers at least HK$50 to HK$60 per hour, and some Chinese restaurants even pay their frontline staff HK$80 or more," he said.

Meanwhile, labour secretary Chris Sun brushed aside concerns that the new mechanism would undermine Hong Kong's competitiveness. 

Speaking to reporters, he said the government has considered many factors.

"We hope to ensure that the wage won't be too low, while minimising the loss of low-paid jobs. We also have to consider the competitiveness of the city at the same time."

"We can't see how the modified minimum wage mechanism would affect the competitiveness of Hong Kong and the business sector," he added.

Chief Executive John Lee, meanwhile, said on social media that the changes could protect grassroots workers. He expressed the hope that officials could work with various sectors to build a "reasonable, fair and safe" environment for workers.

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Observatory warned on Tuesday evening that hail could affect the SAR after it was reported in the Pearl River Delta. 

Hail was reported in Macau as authorities there called on residents to stay indoors.

In Hong Kong, the amber rainstorm warning was issued at 9:30pm.

The forecaster called on people to be alert and seek safe shelter, as violent gusts reaching 110 kilometres per hour affect the territory. 

The Labour Department called on employers to avoid assigning workers to carry out electrical work, and protect the safety of those engaged in such tasks.

"Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by the rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent electric shock as the air would be more humid," said a spokesperson from the department.]]>

    <![CDATA[The number of negative equity cases reached a 20-year high in the first quarter, figures released by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) showed.

According to the HKMA, there were 32,073 cases at the end of March, up 27 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 and the most since the first quarter of 2004.

The HKMA noted that the loans had mainly been taken out by bank staff or linked to mortgage insurance, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio.

Government figures out last week showed home prices rebounded in March, snapping a 10-month losing streak. That's after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech on February 28.]]>

    'New changes to minimum wage fair for businesses'

    <![CDATA[A lawmaker and a representative of small and medium-sized firms on Tuesday welcomed the new way of calculating Hong Kong's minimum wage, which now takes into account the city's economic development and consumer prices.

Danny Lau, the honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said the shake-up is fair for business operators and workers, but it is unreasonable there is no chance of the minimum wage being reduced if times get tough for businesses.

"The only thing that we worry is you can only [increase it], you cannot decrease the minimum wage," he said.  

Under the new changes, the minimum wage would not be reduced but frozen even if the formula produces a negative number. 

Asked if it would put pressure on bosses in small and medium-sized firms when the economy is not doing well, Priscilla Wong, who chairs the Minimum Wage Commission, said a balance needs to be struck.  

“These are the people with the lowest ability to bargain, the least bargaining power. And as a society, we are hoping that their wages do not go through vertically down and go down to the point that we lose our wage floor,” she told a media briefing. 

Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing welcomed the new mechanism, but he told RTHK the administration should give greater weight to GDP in the calculations.

"We hope the proportion that [accounts for] the growth in GDP can be more. This means if we have a large growth of the GDP and then we can have an increase in minimum wages level, that's very important because it allows our grassroots workers to share the fruit of economic development," he said.

Liberal Party's catering sector lawmaker, Tommy Cheung, earlier said the minimum wage could hurt the SAR's competitiveness, calling on authorities to scrap it altogether. 

But labour minister Chris Sun dismissed the suggestion, saying the new changes ensure there is room for low-paid workers to maintain their purchasing power. 

“The design of the formula is to make sure that while we remain competitive, we have to also take care of the needs of those at the very low level. We're just talking about a small number of workers. And as a society, we should help them to make sure that at the very low level, we have enough room for them to be able to earn.”]]>

    HK to adopt new way of calculating minimum wage

    <![CDATA[The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a shake-up of the way Hong Kong's minimum wage is decided, with the wage floor to be reviewed every year in future instead of every two. 

Calculations will include the SAR's economic growth rate in the previous year, as well as consumer prices. 

There'll be no chance of the minimum wage being reduced regardless of what the figures suggest, with any negative calculation leading to a freeze instead. 

The government said it is making the changes based on recommendations from the Minimum Wage Commission, which consulted labour and employer groups as well as academics on the matter last year.

The first minimum wage under the new mechanism will be set in two years' time.

"The recommendations of the [commission] have struck an appropriate balance between the objectives of forestalling excessively low wages and minimising the loss of low-paid jobs, while giving due regard to sustaining Hong Kong's economic growth and competitiveness," said Labour Secretary Chris Sun.

Hong Kong's minimum wage is currently set at HK$40 per hour. The Minimum Wage Commission is to submit a report by the end of October on its recommendations for any change.]]>

    <![CDATA[Health officials on Tuesday warned that an extended flu season would continue for some time, with more outbreaks and serious cases. 

The Centre for Health Protection urged the public to remain vigilant as Hong Kong has seen a rise in flu infections, with more than 500 adults suffering serious complications or dying since January. Most of them are over 65 or have chronic illnesses.

There have been 22 severe flu cases among children, including three deaths. 

Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, from the Centre for Health Protection, said health authorities were closely monitoring the situation. 

"The predominant flu strain has shifted from H3 to H1, resulting in another wave of infections. We expect this wave to continue for a few weeks, but it's difficult to say exactly how long," she said. 

"We are closely monitoring other regions of the world, as Hong Kong residents travel a lot. Influenza B is still circulating in some parts outside Hong Kong, so we cannot rule out the possibility of a further change in the flu strain."

Health authorities urged the public to seek medical attention if they experience flu-like symptoms.]]>
