    <![CDATA[The University of Hong Kong's business school on Tuesday said it was investigating "a small number of cases" in which people submitted forged documents to gain admission to the school.
  
It said it had found that some agencies, which claimed to offer "guaranteed admission", had forged application documents. 

The school said it would not tolerate any acts of dishonesty or academic misconduct. 

"We are committed to academic integrity and to creating a fair learning environment," the school said in a statement. 

"While we understand that securing a place in a top graduate programme is not easy, it is regrettable that this competition has attracted individuals who resort to deceitful means in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage."

The school said that if any of the cases were confirmed to be true, it would take the necessary disciplinary and legal action, including withdrawing offers of admission and referring the cases to the relevant authorities. 

One HKU student told RTHK she was surprised that some people could cheat their way into the university.  

"It's shocking to me...it's quite unfair to other students who have worked very hard to get into the school, while others can just fake it," she said. 
 
Another student said the university should ensure fairness in admission. 

"For future students who want to go to the university...the school needs to have a stricter process for checking their certificates," she said.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Observatory issued its Red Rainstorm Warning Signal at 2.50pm on Tuesday, after the amber signal had been in force for almost five hours.

The observatory said heavy rain was continuing to affect the city, and a band of thundery showers over the southern part of the territory was edging closer. 

It said the downpours were particularly heavy on Lantau, where there could be serious flooding.

The observatory said more than 90 millimetres of hourly rainfall was recorded around noon in Cheung Sha on Lantau.

The Education Bureau said the city's schools should ensure that conditions were safe before allowing students to leave for the day.]]>

    <![CDATA[Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong on Tuesday said the government is considering turning the film set of local movie "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In" into a tourist site.

Speaking at a press briefing on Hong Kong's mega events, Wong said the movie set, which resembles the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City, has been well maintained.

"With regards to the set used in the movie 'Walled In', discussions are taking place. The set has been dismantled, but it's still there. They've been keeping it in rather good condition," he said.

"Discussions are ongoing as to whether they can let us have some parts of the set and it will be put up for display at a suitable location in Hong Kong."

Wong said Hong Kong will host 106 mega events in the latter half of this year, a couple less than the 108 organised in the first six months.

But he said the events still to come are expected to attract more visitors compared to those already held.

"The number of events taking place in the first half of this year is actually more or less similar to the number of events taking place in the second half. But in terms of scale, we noted that some of the events in the second half actually have a much larger capacity in terms of attracting visitors," he said.

"We believe that the number of visitors coming to Hong Kong for those mega events will actually be bigger than those in the first half."]]>

    <![CDATA[Salary increases this year are slightly lower than last year, according to a new report by Jobsdb. 

The employment platform polled nearly 3,400 workers between February and  March, and found that their average pay rise in 2024 was 3.2 percent. That's almost one percentage point lower than last year.

Employees in analytics had the biggest increase at 7.2 percent, followed by legal and compliance, and engineering at about five percent.

Workers in the design, retail sales and manufacturing sectors were at the bottom end with increments of less than one percent. 

The managing director of Jobsdb by SEEK in Hong Kong, Bill Lee, said the lower pay rise should not be a concern. 

“It is roughly within the range of salary increases in Hong Kong in the last ten years, and this number is also above inflation, which was roughly around two percent in March,” he said. 

Lee noted that industries like hospitality and tourism had benefited from the rebounded in visitor numbers, and their staff had a better than average salary rise.

“We do see a significant improvement in the salary and benefits package within the hospitality and tourism job functions. Firstly, within this segment, there's an average increase of 4.2 percent," he said. 

“And over 80 percent of those surveyed within this segment actually received salary increments, so that's a pretty positive outlook.” 

Lee said that jobseekers, particularly those under 25, had shown more interest in working on the mainland which has become the second most popular destination after Australia for Hongkongers seeking work outside the city.

“The policies implemented by the Hong Kong government to encourage more integration with the Greater Bay Area are probably showing some results, increasing the awareness of young people looking to work in the GBA,” he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday said the government will soon release the results of a scheme aimed at promoting the commercialisation of scientific research results and matching university projects with reliable investors.

At the Greater Bay Area Science Forum - Hong Kong Forum at the University of Hong Kong, Chan said the authorities have been rolling out various measures to promote the commercialisation of scientific research results.

One of the measures, he said, is the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme (RAISe+) that was launched last October and is aimed at promoting collaboration between the government, universities, as well as the technology and research industries.

"I am very pleased to report to you that the results of the first round of evaluation results of the scheme will be published within this month, and we will fund over 20 projects covering various fields, including health and medical sciences, new materials, new energy, and artificial intelligence robots et cetera,” Chan told the participants.

He added that authorities will also conduct more collaboration with cities in the Greater Bay Area, especially the manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, to create a vigorous technology and innovation ecosystem, while matching global capital with scientific institutions and universities.

Separately, Chan said the government will prepare and establish a third InnoHK research and development cluster in the second half of this year, to ramp up the SAR's tech transition.

The new cluster will focus on advanced manufacturing, materials, energy, and sustainable development, while the existing clusters focus on healthcare-related technologies, artificial intelligence, and robotics.

“Hong Kong, as an international financial centre, could play a positive role in guiding funds by being a ‘super connector’. The innovation and technology industries as well as the finance industry in the Greater Bay Area can support each other, and they are equivalent to combining the competitive strengths of the San Francisco Bay Area and the New York Bay Area,” Chan said.

The finance chief added that over 50 key enterprises, many in the innovation and tech fields, have been attracted to the SAR since late 2022, and it's estimated they will bring in investments worth more than HK$40 billion and create 13,000 jobs in the coming few years. 

Some 120,000 individuals have recently arrived in the SAR via the government’s various talent import schemes, with 20 percent of them working in the innovation and technology industries, Chan said.]]>

    CE warns against citizen sting ops on Uber drivers

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee urged people without proper training to refrain from mounting sting operations, after taxi drivers went undercover to try to tackle unlicensed ride-hailing services. 

Cabbies raised eyebrows and caused controversy by travelling as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police had been called to. 

But Lee warned there were risks for people taking matters into their own hands, and that they should refer the issue to law enforcement officers instead. 

"These operations should be undertaken by law enforcement agencies. And the law enforcement agencies that take these undercover actions will have to abide by rules and regulations. The officers involved have been well-trained. They act within the framework of the law," he said. 

"You need training to handle emergency situations. Without proper training and without adequate legal understanding, I advise people not to do it, because they may break the law." 

The CE also noted the Transport and Logistics Bureau would report to lawmakers the results of a study on ride-hailing services in July.]]>

    Govt to release findings on waste charging next week

   <description>
    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government attached importance to people's views on the waste charging scheme, as officials prepare to present their plans to the Legislative Council next week. 

His comments came after a survey by the Chinese-language newspaper Ta Kung Pao found that more than 90 percent of the 30,000 people polled were against the pay-as-you-throw scheme, while more than 70 percent said it should be scrapped.

The scheme has been on trial since April in 14 different locations, including at homes, shops and restaurants. Officials had previously said it remained to be seen whether a full roll-out would take place as planned on August 1. 

Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said the government was assessing the experience gained during the trial and the challenges that may arise in implementing the law. 

He stressed the government was taking the views of society seriously.

"In my opinion, a policy that would affect more than seven million citizens should be carefully considered. Even though the law was drafted before this government took office, we should still consider how to implement it," he said. 

"We will explain to the Legislative Council next week what we have learnt from the pilot, the problems we have identified and the feedback we have received from the community, including through the media."]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that clear key performance indicators (KPIs) must be set for the development and operation of the West Kowloon Cultural District, adding that government money must be spent carefully. 

He made the comment ahead of the weekly Exco meeting after the chairman of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, Henry Tang, said museums at the arts hub may have to reduce the days they are open unless more funds are secured in the next year or so.

Lee said the government is in communication with the authority regarding viable funding options.

"We have high expectations of the successful operation of the West Kowloon Cultural District, and it has been creating value for Hong Kong," he said. 

"In many areas, it has been doing a job which satisfies the expectations and wishes of the community and the government, but we want to ensure that there will be a long-term viable financing plan with good KPIs."

Lee added that the district was designed to be self-financing following its initial endowment from the government.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee said internet service providers have been complying with a court injunction against the protest song "Glory to Hong Kong".

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said hyperlinks to the song could no longer be found on local platforms. 

"We've noted that there's no link shown on any local platform relating to the song, and also Google Search doesn't show any link to the song in question either," he said. 

"We will continue to monitor the situation to see whether there is any non-compliance with the court order. If we notice such instances, then we will notify the platform on the contents of the court order."

Earlier this month, the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction against the protest song, banning anyone with seditious intent from playing or performing it on national security grounds. 

Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, said last week that it would comply with the court ruling, restricting viewing of 32 banned links related to the song in Hong Kong.]]>

    HK to host over 200 mega events this year: CE

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong is set to host dozens more mega events this year which were expected to draw millions of visitors, Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday.

The city's leader also said arts and culture shows, sports competitions, trade exhibitions and financial summits would be among the more than 100 events held in the latter half of the year, including brand new ones such as a performing arts expo and a fashion design week. 

“The total number of mega events over the year is increased from 150 to [over] 210. That means there will be [at least] one mega event every two days," he told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting. 

“We think that these mega events will attract about 1.7 million visitors. They will bring with them about HK$7.2 billion, which is about HK$4.3 billion in economic gain.”

Lee also said Hong Kong welcomed more than 14 million visitors in the first four months, double from the same period a year ago, and that there was a surge of tourists coming from the United States, Canada and Indonesia. 

"We reckon that for every 1.5 million visitors, there will be a 0.1 percent growth in GDP. For long-term stay visitors, they will bring even a higher percentage point in growth of our GDP," he said. 

The CE added his administration would seek more measures from Beijing that benefits the SAR, including raising the duty-free goods allowance for mainland tourists.

Shaman Chellaram, a senior director in valuation and advisory services at the investment management firm Colliers, said the strong Hong Kong dollar had discouraged people from visiting, as it is more expensive for tourists to travel to the city.

However, Chellaram said these mega events could offer tourists a variety of new experiences and attractions. 

"People are always attracted to exciting things. And what we're seeing in the market at the moment is that the global travel trend is geared towards more experiences. And if those mega events that the city has planned out for the rest of the year can really curate a unique experience, then that will really lead to a jump in tourism numbers," he told RTHK.

Chellaram also believed that having mega events would boost the local tourism industry by bringing in more visitors to the SAR.

    MTR stations better protected from storm flooding

   <description>
    <![CDATA[The MTR has installed a flood detection system at 26 stations, to prepare for the coming rain and typhoon season. 

The initiative comes after Wong Tai Sin Station was flooded during a heavy downpour last September, resulting in the partial suspension of the Kwun Tong Line.

Speaking to reporters, the MTR’s Chief of Airport Segment, Ben Lui, said the rail giant had placed flood sensors at 42 entrances and exits. 

"When water reaches the sensors, it will trigger an alarm to the station staff. Upon receiving the alarm, the staff will check the CCTV to confirm if there is flooding. If there is flooding, our staff will set flood barriers and temporarily cordon off the affected area. There will also be announcements for the public to use other exits to leave the station," he added.

Lui also said the MTR would suspend all services on above ground sections of the network, including the light railway and airport express, whenever the typhoon signal No. 9 or higher was in effect.

However, if trains were still above ground when the second-highest typhoon signal was raised, they would continue to their designated destinations, or at least to major stations such as Yuen Long or Sha Tin, where passengers could find shelter. 

The MTR would also provide water and food for affected passengers under such circumstances.

Lawmaker Gary Zhang said the newly installed flood sensors at station exits would provide early alerts to MTR staff, enabling them to proactively prevent flooding.

However, Zhang, who's a former MTR engineer, expressed concerns regarding the safety of station staff who would need to set up flood-proof barriers themselves amid extreme weather.

"Even for a small station like Wong Tai Sin, there are more than eight entrances, and each entrance has to be installed with floodblocks manually by the station staff. And the manpower is definitely still a concern and also a constraint," he told RTHK.

Zhang said the rail operator was thinking about installing automatic flood-proof barriers at stations to minimise the risks to staff safety.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong’s jobless rate remained stable at three percent in the three-month period ending in April.

Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed that the underemployment rate also remained unchanged, at 1.1 percent.

About 5,700 people were newly employed during the three-month period, bringing the total employment number to 3.69 million. The labour force, meanwhile, increased by about 7,700 to 3.8 million.

However, some 2,000 people became jobless during the period, sending the total number of unemployed to 113,700.

The number of underemployed people stood at 40,500, largely unchanged compared with the previous three-month period.

Commenting on the latest figures, labour chief Chris Sun said the unemployment rates of various sectors remained low in general, with only small changes observed.

He said he expects "continued economic growth" to keep the labour market tight in the near term.

Sun also noted that there was a monthly average of 75,425 vacancies in the private sector between February and April, which was a decrease of nearly 30 percent on a yearly basis and a drop of 2.7 percent compared with the first three months of the year.]]>

    Label issued to "smart and safe" construction sites

    <![CDATA[The Development Bureau and Construction Industry Council have launched a new programme to encourage the use of the Smart Site Safety System on construction sites, with applications open on Monday. 

Sites that successfully implement the system, which includes features like centralised management platforms, monitoring devices for frontline staff and electric locks for hazardous areas, would now be recognised with a label.  

Speaking at the launch ceremony of the programme, Development Secretary Bernadette Linn explained the participation rate for the safety system, especially for private sites, was still relatively low, and such labels were believed to increase their safety awareness.  

“The programme aims to encourage more construction sites to adopt the Smart Site Safety System by providing them with a label, or a ‘plaque’, to identify and facilitate monitoring of those sites that have properly installed and applied the system,” she said. 

“We estimate that the first batch of about 100 construction sites will receive the label by July this year.  With an estimated minimum of 500 sites participating, we hope to have all labels issued by the end of the year, covering over 60 percent of all construction sites.”

She said such labels would be displayed at strategic spots outside the construction sites for recognition.

“In other words, everyone will know which sites have such labels. For sites that don’t have such labels. Obviously relevant government departments will pay more attention during their usual inspections. And the construction industry will know which sites haven’t implemented the Smart Site Safety System. I believe this will create a certain pressure,” she said. 

Linn added that sites should still be cautious even if they have been issued the “plaque”, saying it could still be scrapped if they don't perform site safety properly.]]>

    <![CDATA[Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung on Monday said more public servants were able to report for duty on time under a mobilisation protocol used during a government-wide drill on handling emergencies. 

The exercise last month simulated a situation where a super typhoon was approaching Hong Kong, with civil servants called up to assist residents in low-lying areas. 

At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Yeung said the exercise showed that public servants had improved their internal communication, compared to the first drill held about a year ago. 

"The [Civil Service Bureau] worked with different bureaus and departments and we were able to contact all staff required within 40 minutes. And the relevant bureaus and departments also, within a short period time, contacted their staff members. So 99 percent of our staff members were able to arrive at the designated locations within a specified time. This shows that the communication mechanism worked," she told lawmakers.

Yeung added that authorities were able to swiftly deliver supplies from storage facilities set up across the city to specified locations.

Lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung, of the Federation of Trade Unions, raised concerns about civil servants having to catch up their usual work after being deployed under the mechanism. 

In response, Yeung said she believes bureaus and departments would take a "compassionate approach". 

"Say, if the mobilisation exercise [on a work day] completes at 5.30pm, no staff will be asked to go back to their original post to finish their work. The work will be shared among other colleagues," she said.

Government-wide mobilisation went into effect twice last year, with hundreds of civil servants deployed to help clear up the aftermath of Super Typhoon Saola as well as following torrential downpours in September.]]>

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui on Monday said the government will not delay plans to start keeping the stock markets open during severe weather conditions. 

His remark came after reports suggested the authorities could delay bringing in the change until the end of the year or early next year.

Speaking to reporters after attending the China Private Equity Summit, Hui said officials are sticking to the original timeline.

"Our timeline has not been changed, and it's been clear the whole time. That is, we'll announce relevant details of the implementation by the middle of this year when we publish the results of the public consultation on this regard,” Hui said.

“And when the markets are ready, we'll start implementing relevant arrangements.”

No date for the move has been set. 

Earlier, Hui told participants at the summit that Hong Kong remains competitive when it comes to firms raising capital, and authorities will continue to attract leading enterprises from the mainland to list in the SAR.

Separately, Hui also said the SAR government will publish a policy statement regarding the development of artificial intelligence (AI) by the end of this year.

“AI is already being applied in various areas of banking, securities, insurance, accounting, retirement, protection and green finance in Hong Kong,” he said.

“The government will strive to capitalise on the opportunities brought by AI while also managing the risks and challenges.”]]>

    Leave policing to the police: taxi association chief

    <![CDATA[Taxi drivers should not be going undercover to try to tackle unlicensed ride-hailing services and the matter should be left to the police, an industry spokesman said on Monday.

Videos online appear to show cabbies travelling as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police have been called to. 

Chow Kwok-keung, chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, told RTHK he does not agree with such an approach.

He added, however, that there were only 33 prosecutions over unlicensed ride-hailing services last year and the taxi trade is disappointed with the amount of action taken by the authorities. 

"Ride-hailing services are legal, but if these companies do not verify whether or not the cars in service have a hire car permit, the insurance of these cars already becomes invalid. This becomes a problem for all road users including third-party vehicles, pedestrians, passengers and even the driver of the ride-hailing car," he said. 

"If there is a serious accident and there's no compensation for casualties, people would criticise the SAR's governance and nobody wants to see that."

Chow said he hopes plans for new fleets of taxis will improve services, leading to less demand for ride-hailing firms.]]>

    'Smaller Olympic presence will still be a success'

    <![CDATA[The chief executive of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Tony Choi, said on Sunday that qualifying for fewer events at the Paris Olympics compared with the Tokyo Games will still be considered a success for Hong Kong athletes.

Speaking on a TVB programme, Choi estimated that Hong Kong would qualify for about 30 events in all disciplines this time, about 10 fewer than in Tokyo three years ago. 

Choi said the SAR's success at the Tokyo Games was partly due to its Covid-19 measures, which minimised the pandemic's impact on elite athletes' training and gave Hong Kong the edge over other places.

Hong Kong won one gold, two silver and three bronze medals in Tokyo, its best showing at an Olympics.

"When the Hong Kong Sports Institute was preparing for the Tokyo Olympics, we didn't stop training for a single day. I believe many countries and regions couldn't do that. So back then, we had such advantages," he said.

"This time, we're getting more than 30 tickets, which is still reaching our target."

Choi also expressed hopes of breaking the pattern of Hong Kong winning medals every other Olympics, since windsurfer Lee Lai-shan captured gold in Atlanta in 1996 for the city's first medal ever.

“We got a medal in the 1996 [Olympics], then in 2000 we didn’t. And in 2004 we had one and 2008 we didn’t. 2012 we got a medal then 2016 we didn’t... Honestly speaking, the Hong Kong team’s results are relatively inconsistent. We hope everything can be more stable,” he said. 

“We hope to win at least a medal in every Olympics... We need to maintain a stable performance in the international sports scene in order to compete with other sports powerhouses.”

Choi said Hong Kong is already competitive in sports such as fencing, swimming, table tennis, badminton, karate and squash, and it'll take time to catch up in other disciplines.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police on Sunday said they have arrested two people on suspicion of vandalising a tombstone in Tseung Kwan O Chinese Permanent Cemetery.

According to video circulating online, it belonged to Wong Ka-kui, the late singer of the now-disbanded musical band, Beyond.

The video purportedly showed someone smashing the tombstone with a hammer, as well as spraying liquid and writing with a black marker on it.

Officers said the pair arrested are aged 15 and 23.

Writing on social media, a former member of Beyond, Yip Sai-wing, called the incident "truly outrageous" and said anyone found guilty of carrying out the act must be punished.

Wong died in 1993 at the age of 31.]]>
