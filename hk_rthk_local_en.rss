    Inquest experts differ over patient's liver failure

    <![CDATA[A transplant surgeon has stressed that a second organ transplant for a liver disease patient was the only way to keep her alive, as the Coroner’s Court heard conflicting explanations as to why the patient developed acute hepatic failure before her death.

Tang Kwai-sze, a hepatitis B carrier, underwent two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017 and died in August that same year at the age of 44.  

Two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.

Henry Pleass, a transplant surgeon in Australia, said it was unfortunate that medical practitioners did not give Tang medication needed along with the steroids she was taking.

“It’s our modern system with many other doctors looking after one individual. There’s no continuation,” he told the inquest's five-person jury and coroner Monica Chow. 

“We made the assumption that people have thought about the issue, and thought about the risks.”

Tang had experienced medical issues after the first transplant and Pleass said while doctors could have treated her conservatively, the surgery for a new organ gave her a chance of survival. 

On the cause of Tang’s liver failure, Pleass said it was “absolutely” because of a hepatitis B flare-up, ruling out the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis as suggested by another expert witness. 

Earlier, histopathologist Wilson Tsui said it was more likely that Tang suffered from autoimmune hepatitis.

Tsui said the high count of plasma cells and the absence of serologic markers, which are used to identify antibodies formed following an infection, indicated that a hepatitis B flare-up was less likely to have been the case. 

“To differentiate between a reactivation of hepatitis B and autoimmune hepatitis, [the count of plasma cells] is a relatively important index,” he said. 

But James Fung, an expert witness called to give evidence again after Tsui’s testimony, said the majority of patients with an acute hepatitis flare-up would still test negative for such serological markers. 

Fung, a transplant hepatologist at Queen Mary Hospital, also noted that while a higher count of plasma cells is commonly associated with autoimmune hepatitis, there could be exceptions.  

“Especially with very severe acute flares of hepatitis B, [plasma] cells themselves are often seen in these severe cases,” he said. 

The hearing continues.]]>

    Govt to adopt new heatstroke rules for outdoor workers

   <description>
    <![CDATA[Labour officials on Monday said they were updating guidelines on when outdoor workers would be advised to stop working when it's very hot. 

This would enable the department’s heat stress warning system to be in line with the observatory's warnings about hot weather.

The observatory’s "extremely hot special alert" is issued when it's generally 35 degree Celcius and above. 

Some environmental and workers' groups had called for such a linkage between the two alert systems last year when the department’s guidelines were introduced. 

The Labour Department said the updated guidelines would apply next month. 

The guidelines also set out the varying lengths of breaks workers should be given every hour when the heat stress warnings are in effect.

The new rules state that if employers adopt a certain amount of measures to prevent heatstroke - such as reducing workload, providing shades and using mist fans to improve ventilation - they can completely cut the hourly breaks for workers.

If insufficient measures were adopted, the guidelines said, employers would be required to give longer breaks to workers.

Employers would be given flexibility to alternate break times for different workers, and they can split break periods into shorter ones so as to minimise the effects on work progress.]]>

    Jail term needed for not reporting child abuse: govt

    <![CDATA[The Undersecretary for Labour and Welfare, Ho Kai-ming, on Monday said jail terms for professionals who fail to report suspected child abuse cases should be kept in the draft legislation. 

According to the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill, which is currently making its way through the Legislative Council, the maximum penalty for not reporting suspected severe child abuse cases would be a three-month jail term and a fine of HK$50,000. 

Several lawmakers have suggested removing the prison term, saying it is too harsh.

Speaking at a Legco's bills committee, Ho reassured lawmakers that professionals, who work with children, would only face prison if they fail to report extremely severe cases.

"Professionals will only face imprisonment in extremely severe cases. This means that professionals, who genuinely suspect that a child has suffered significant harm - or is facing actual risks - yet fail to report it without meeting any exemptions for reporting or providing any reasonable justifications, only then will prosecution be initiated," he explained. 

Ho warned that scrapping a prison sentence from the bill would lower the effectiveness of the legislation, and society would have to bear the consequences.]]>

    'HK to adopt soft sell tactics to promote patriotism'

    <![CDATA[Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Monday that a "soft sell" approach will be adopted when it comes to promoting patriotism in Hong Kong.

Chan, who chairs the new Working Group on Patriotic Education, said the group is aimed at integrating patriotism into core values of the community, but this will not involve "hard sell" tactics.

"Patriotism is not something that can be learnt by repeating from memory. Getting to understand is the first step. The ultimate goal is to achieve emotional identification. Sincerely identify with the country, feel proud of the country and then consciously love and protect the country," Chan told reporters after an inaugural meeting of the working group.

Chan said the group will make reference to the mainland's patriotic education law and come up with appropriate and suitable proposals for the SAR.

But he said the government has no plans to legislate patriotism and will rely on policies and activities to promote it.

Chan also said the government will organise various activities and celebrations in the run-up to October's 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, to enable young people to learn more about their country.]]>

    <![CDATA[Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Monday said national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law places no "extra and unreasonable" restrictions on press freedom and the media can still sharply criticise the government. 

In an op-ed published in Ming Pao Daily, the minister said there was no move to introduce restrictions on the press through the law.

He said the administration wants the media to pass on accurate, fair and positive information so that officials can lead society to make changes.

"At the same time, [officials] need to comprehensively know the ideas, needs and demands from the public [through the press]," Lam wrote.

He said so long as the media continue to be impartial, objective and fair in adhering to fundamental professional codes in seeking the truth, there is no need for journalists to be particularly concerned about violating the security law.

In the piece titled "Change and no change", Lam said while the enactment of the homegrown security law last month marked a major change, there are also things that have remained constant such as the values of common law and the rule of law.

"On the one hand it improved the legislation on safeguarding national security. It also fully respects fundamental human rights and freedoms on the other," he wrote.]]>

    <![CDATA[Lawmakers and families of pupils at an aided Catholic school in Wan Chai on Sunday accused education officials of inaction over the institution's decision to shut earlier than it had originally planned. 

Rosaryhill Secondary School on Stubbs Road first announced last September that it would cease operations after the 2025-26 academic year. 

The government-aided school later said it would arrange for Form One to Five pupils to transfer to Yu Chun Keung Memorial College No 2 this September. Rosaryhill Kindergarten and Rosaryhill (Primary) School, meanwhile, will be combined with Dalton School Hong Kong.

The brother of a Form Five pupil – a former Rosaryhill student himself – expressed concerns about his sister's education at her new school.

”The Education Bureau was relatively passive and not willing to help us on this issue... Pupils are not as simple as assets that you could transfer to others," he said. 

The mother of a Form Three student condemned the Education Bureau for not having met parents over the issue, which she said weighed heavily on her son. 

Election Committee legislator Doreen Kong urged the administration to address the issue. 

“We don't want this to happen again. The [Education Bureau] must explain to the public what the principles are and what the policies of the government are in handling all these similar situations,” she said. 

"They have to come out to help the students and to ensure that there is a smooth transition for all the students, especially to overcome their psychological distress."

Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, for his part, said he would file a complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman. 

“I find that the school is not professional enough to take care of the students. And the administrative side is also not totally concerned about the rights and interests of students and parents... I want to clarify, during the process, what role did the administration play," he said. 

Tik said he would also talk to authorities on pushing back the school’s shutdown, to let senior secondary pupils finish their studies there.]]>

    Govt mulls manhole training for all sewer workers

   <description>
    <![CDATA[Development minister Bernadette Linn said officials want to step up training of sewer workers to prevent incidents involving manholes.

Her comments came after the death of two workers last week at a manhole in Sha Tin, the same site where two others died nearly two decades ago. 

Speaking on a TVB programme, Linn said the contracts state that workers should only operate on the ground, and if relevant works require them to enter the manhole, only qualified personnel are allowed and risk assessment must be conducted beforehand. 

She also said officials are looking into adding clauses to future contracts, requiring workers who only conduct cleaning on the ground to go through training as well.

"If you do enter manholes [in future], you have to inform the Drainage Services Department beforehand and receive its approval," she said.

"We're considering making it mandatory for those doing the cleaning on the ground to also go through manhole training. This is to raise their awareness."

Separately, Linn said officials are considering whether to immediately prosecute homeowners found to have illegal structures, rather than issuing orders for removal.

The government has been reviewing the Buildings Ordinance after cases of unauthorised structures were reported.

The development secretary said the administration is studying whether the prosecution process can be streamlined, the prosecution threshold lowered and relevant fines raised.

She noted that a clause in the current legislation stipulates harsher penalties for offenders who "knowingly" violate the law. Linn said officials want to remove such wording, which she said allows homeowners to claim they were not aware of the illegal structures and that the problem had already existed before they bought the place.

But the minister said officials will make sure the relevant amendments – to be put forward in the final quarter of this year – will be reasonable.]]>

    <![CDATA[Tourism chief Kevin Yeung said a pyrotechnic display scheduled for May 1 may be cancelled because of bad weather.

The show, hosted by the Hong Kong Tourism Board, is set to be held across Victoria Harbour to kick off a campaign of regular fireworks displays aimed at boosting tourism. 

But according to the Observatory's forecast, the weather on Labour Day is expected to be cloudy with showers and squally thunderstorms.

The secretary for culture, sports and tourism on Sunday said authorities could wait until Wednesday to decide whether the show would be held as planned.

"We shall keep an eye on the weather and make announcements as early as possible. It may not be until the afternoon of May 1 that we can officially say whether the display will be affected," Yeung said. 

"We hope that tourists coming to Hong Kong will be prepared mentally that some performances may not be possible due to the rain."

Yeung also said the administration is prepared for the arrival of visitors in the coming week, adding that hotel bookings for the Golden Week holiday have been strong.

”The Golden Week holiday will help boost businesses in Hong Kong. Of course, I hope if the weather is good, it will be more convenient for those visiting Hong Kong," he said.]]>

    Moves to boost mainland business, skilled staff travel

    <![CDATA[The central government on Sunday announced measures to facilitate visits by mainland business representatives and skilled workers to Hong Kong.

According to the National Immigration Administration, mainland residents holding Business Visit Endorsements will be permitted to stay in Hong Kong for up to 14 days, starting from May 6.

Mainlanders who wish to travel to Hong Kong for business purposes are required to obtain an exit endorsement for business visit from the mainland authorities, and at the moment they're allowed to stay here for up to one week.

The authorities also announced that mainland residents can apply for the travel document at any relevant offices across the country, regardless of the applicant's place of household registration or place of residence.

Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing, Wang Ling from the National Immigration Administration said the change can benefit more than 100 million business entities across the country.

"This change aims to better meet the needs of long-term business activity and to support business professionals in seeking opportunities and conducting in-depth business negotiations. According to our preliminary estimates, the new policy is expected to benefit over 100 million businesses and more than 30,000 enterprises and institutions that have registered and applied for multiple Business Visit Endorsements," she added. 

Officials also said they will extend the multiple-entry visas for skilled workers to visit Hong Kong and Macau which currently applies only to Greater Bay Area residents.

From May 6, eligible talent from Beijing and Shanghai will too be able to apply for the visa to visit the two SARs, with each stay limited to 30 days.

Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun thanked the central government for the new measures, saying they would help the SAR to attract talent.

"The two new measures will facilitate Hong Kong's further integration into the national development and achieve concrete results on the solid policy foundation of facilitating the 'southbound and northbound' two-way flow of talents," a government spokesperson added in a statement. 

The spokesperson also said the SAR government will continue to promote talent exchange with the mainland authorities, to create a stronger drive for growth in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area.

Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said the scheme involving skilled workers may be extended to more mainland cities in future.

"It depends on the implementation. We have the potential to have these arrangements further expanded to other cities, especially those cities with closer business connections with Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area," she told RTHK.

"I think the central government will look at the actual situation and decide whether to expand or not."

Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who's also general manager of the artificial intelligence firm SenseTime Hong Kong, said the new measures would enhance the SAR's competitiveness.

"Singapore already provides visa-free to mainland China, right?... Hong Kong needs to be more attractive. So, today the scheme has some benefits for Beijing and Shanghai citizens. That's good for Hong Kong," he said.

Shang added that the new measures would make it more convenient to do business in Hong Kong, as mainland business travellers are allowed to stay longer in the city.

    <![CDATA[Unionists have defended the need for the city to have a minimum wage and called for "reasonable and objective" discussion on the issue, after a lawmaker suggested scrapping the basic hourly rate.

The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) said the statutory minimum wage, which is currently at HK$40, is essential to protecting employees, in response to comments by Liberal Party legislator Tommy Cheung of the catering sector that the minimum wage could hurt Hong Kong's competitiveness.

On Sunday, FTU chairman Kingsley Wong said having a minimum wage in place is a common practice worldwide.

"The main purpose of the minimum wage is to be a policy safety net, to ensure grassroots or the most disadvantaged local workers receive appropriate protection," Wong said.

"On the issue of the minimum wage, we should be reasonable and objective. Around the world, many countries and regions in the West and Asia have a minimum wage, so the minimum wage must be an appropriate measure then."

Wong also renewed calls for the statutory minimum wage to be reviewed annually, instead of once every two years.

In light of a recent string of deadly industrial accidents, the FTU called on various stakeholders such as employers, workers, architects and developers to do their part to ensure occupational safety.

Other demands by the federation ahead of this year's Labour Day included priority be given to local labour, better protection for employees who have to stay online after office hours – also known as “invisible overtime” – and standardised contracts of delivery platform workers.]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday Hong Kong's GDP growth in the first quarter is expected to be in line with the government's forecast of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent. 

He said the advance estimates for the January-March period, which will be announced on Thursday, would reflect moderate growth for the economy for five straight quarters, dating back to the start of 2023.

"Besides opening up new points for economic growth, we also need to continue to consolidate the traditional elements," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.

He noted the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holidays would attract an estimated 800,000 visitors to Hong Kong, highlighted by a maiden pyrotechnic display at Victoria Harbour on May 1.

The financial secretary said a series of mega events will follow, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, the World Cultures Festival and the Vinexpo Asia for a showcase of wine and spirits late next month.

On stocks, Chan said the Hang Seng Index rose by 8.8 percent in the past week, its best weekly performance in 13 years. 

He attributed the surge to tech shares buoyed by AI and IT developments, as well as stimulus measures by mainland authorities.

Chan added that an updated scheme allowing some mainland residents to buy wealth management products in Hong Kong made tremendous strides last month.

The Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme recorded more than 13.1 billion yuan in transactions in March, which the finance chief said was close to half of the total amount since the scheme's launch in late 2021.]]>

    'Keep jail term for not reporting child abuse'

    <![CDATA[Concern groups on Sunday said proposed jail sentences for people who fail to report child abuse should be kept in place.

According to the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill currently making it way through the Legislative Council, professionals such as social workers, teachers and doctors are required to report suspected cases of serious child abuse, and those who fail to comply face a maximum penalty of a three-month prison term and a fine of HK$50,000.

Some lawmakers have suggested removing the prison term, calling it too harsh.

Gary Wong from the Commission on Children – a government advisory body on child affairs – said the proposed three-month sentence is reasonable.

"The ultimate objective is to protect the children. And, if we set up the penalty level, which is not high enough, the impact is not great, right?" he told reporters after speaking on a radio programme. 

"That is why we think that the three-month imprisonment, together with the HK$50,000 fine, is a reasonable threshold, reasonable level of penalty."

Donna Wong, director of Against Child Abuse, said the proposed penalty should not be lowered, citing the 1,457 child abuse cases reported last year.

"Lowering the penalty will hinder the development of the mandatory reporting of the trial bill, because it will lower the effectiveness of the bill and hinder the deterrence effect," she said.

Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said he believes a balance could be struck between bringing in a deterrent mechanism against the non-reporting of child abuse and addressing concerns of professionals who may be affected by the proposed law.

"So the most important thing is we need deterrence against serious cases. But if the cases are minor, as often is the case, we think we can find a package that is acceptable to both the relevant sectors and those advocating for child protection," he told reporters.

A Legco bills committee is scrutinising the proposed legislation.

    Over 800,000 mainlanders expected here for Golden Week

    <![CDATA[The Tourism Board's executive director on Saturday said he thinks major events like the Victoria Harbour firework and drone displays will still be a big draw for mainland visitors during the Golden Week holiday. 
 
Speaking on a HOY TV programme, Dane Cheng said he expects more than 800,000 mainland tourists to visit the SAR during the break, but that he doubts the numbers can return to pre-pandemic levels. 

"I think it's unrealistic for Hong Kong to return to the tourist figures of 2018 and 2019. Hongkongers find it difficult to accommodate so many tourists, no matter where they come from. Even when taking public transport like the bus and train, or going shopping, there are many people," he said. 

"It's important to create a good experience for both visitors and locals. Of course visitors hope to have a good experience when they come, and not encounter crowds everywhere they go."

Cheng added that he is in talks with the government and vendors to see whether the revamped Temple Street Night market can be made permanent. 

Last week the Tourism Board announced that the market, part of the government’s "Night Vibes Hong Kong" campaign to spice up the city’s nightlife, would stay until the end of this year.

Meanwhile, the government has announced a series of measures to prepare for the influx of visitors, such as allowing cross-border shuttle buses to increase service frequency and extending the operating hours of the last East Rail Line train to Lo Wu on some days. The MTR also said it would increase train services on seven rail lines, adding a total of 540 train trips during Golden Week. 

The mainland's Golden Week break runs between May 1 and May 5.

    <![CDATA[Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday said security cameras, installed in Mong Kok this month, have helped officers detect two serious crimes. Their installation was the first stage of a government plan to install about 2,000 CCTV cameras across Hong Kong this year.

Speaking to reporters after attending an event, Siu said the surveillance cameras had been effective.

"In just half a month, we detected two serious crime cases with the help of CCTV cameras. One was related to possessing imitation firearms, and we arrested three men. The other one was a robbery case, and we arrested a man within 24 hours," he said. 

"After installing these 15 CCTV cameras, we will see if there’s anything we can improve. We will then install 600 cameras at crime black spots across Hong Kong in the middle of this year."

Asked about privacy concerns, Siu said the Privacy Commissioner had given advice to the government, and that the authorities had also asked an independent consultancy firm to conduct a privacy impact assessment.]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Services Minister Christopher Hui on Saturday said a recent move by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to provide more mainland business for Hong Kong is an opportunity for the SAR's financial sector. 

The measures, announced earlier this month, include opening up more Hong Kong-based exchange-traded funds for mainland investors and encouraging mainland companies to list here.   

Speaking on a radio programme, Hui said the stock exchange is currently processing around 100 listing applications from outside Hong Kong.  

"Through the efforts of our stock exchange and other parties, we have been promoting the advantages of our Hong Kong listing platform to different potential issuers," he said.  

"I believe, with the support of our country's policy, our stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission will continue to work hard and encourage more companies to consider using Hong Kong as a listing platform for their financing."

Asked about a rise in bankruptcy petitions, Hui said he believed this was due to a number of reasons, including high interest rates. 

"This is due to several factors. Of course, some past petitions might come back after the pandemic. At the same time, the economic situation could play a part," he said. 

The treasury chief added that officials would continue to monitor the changes in the figures before deciding whether action was needed.]]>

    Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs

    <![CDATA[The Housing Secretary Winnie Ho on Saturday said the operating costs for light public flats should not be compared with traditional public housing units, as the government prepares to take applications for the first of the flats. 

Responding to a question on an RTHK radio show, she said the new flats have a different set of facilities so an exact comparison cannot be made. 

"For traditional public flats, the operating cost only includes about HK$500 for cleaning and security, and about HK$400 for maintenance and repair work, so it's a total of about HK$1,000," she said. 

"But there are additional social welfare facilities for light public flats, and there are social welfare organisations providing services for residents. For example, there may be a shared living room for residents, and activities for them. Like transitional housing, there are shops, restaurants, or laundry services for residents."

The first batch of the modular temporary units, announced in the 2022 Policy Address to fill the short-term gap in public housing supply, will be completed in Yuen Long in the first quarter of next year. About 2,100 will be available with applications starting in the next few months.

Ho also said she was confident that 30,000 light public housing units would be completed by 2027 at the latest.]]>

    Public adapting quickly to plastic ban: minister

    <![CDATA[Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said the public was adapting quickly to the plastic-free scheme. 

The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban started on Monday, and restaurants are now barred from selling and using plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.

He told a radio programme that authorities had visited about 1,700 retail and catering premises in the past week and almost all of the large chains, and about half of the smaller restaurants, had changed to non-plastic utensils. 

"In terms of effectiveness, many chain restaurants told us that about 60 to 70 percent of customers, who bought takeaway food, didn't need disposable utensils. This phenomenon is very good because one of the aims of the plastic ban scheme was for people to bring their own utensils," he said.

A chain supermarket was found to be selling sushi in paper boxes this week, with people describing it as "sushi in blind boxes".

Tse said it's unreasonable and unnecessary for supermarkets to use non-plastic packaging.

"Supermarkets may allow customers to eat at their tables. People normally think it's considered as dine-in, but in this situation, supermarkets expected customers to take out their food. In reality, a lot of people do take away their food," he said.

"When supermarkets pack their food, they won't know whether customers will choose to take out or dine in... We think that treating this as takeaway is appropriate, according to the regulations."

Responding to the quality of non-plastic utensils, Tse said the ban had just begun, and he believed that restaurants would be able to choose better substitutes later on.]]>
