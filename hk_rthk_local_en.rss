    Insufficient load test led to DC poll glitch: EAC

    <![CDATA[A technical team behind the electronic poll register system, which failed during December's District Council polls, did not conduct sufficient load test on the programme, the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) concluded on Friday. 

In a report on the citywide polls, the watchdog also recommended the Registration and Electoral Office to identify experts in fixing the system's issues and run simulations of a large-scale election regularly. 

Last year, the glitch led to authorities extending voting hours by one and a half hours, and polling stations switching to printed copies of the voter register to issue ballot papers.

The report noted that design issues of the electronic poll register system caused the central processing unit to overload and unnecessarily tied up a substantial amount of resources in the server when electoral staff tried to log in to the programme. 

"When altering the system design, the [Registration and Electoral Office's] technical team did not fully consider the cumulative effect and impacts on loading that might be induced to the system during actual operation, and therefore did not conduct sufficient and comprehensive load test," the report said. 

The commission said the electoral office should identify suitable experts to rectify design issues and conduct "adequate, comprehensive and stringent tests", while running simulated large-scale elections on a regular basis.

"The [Registration and Electoral Office] should learn a lesson from this system failure, and actively implement the above recommendations to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents in future," it said. 

"As to whether any individual officers should be held responsible for the incident, it will be followed up by the administration according to the established procedures."]]>

    <![CDATA[The president of the Law Society on Friday said Beijing officials they had met during their visit to the capital approved of their work in safeguarding the rule of law. 

Wrapping up their four-day trip to Beijing, CM Chan said they had met representatives of 12 organisations, including the Ministry of Justice and the Basic Law Committee.

Chan said the officials praised the society for remaining impartial and professional when discussing major legal issues, and for using simple language to explain the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance to members of the public during the legislative process.

"The Law Society understands that safeguarding national security and protecting freedoms is not a zero-sum game. I am very confident that with the judicial independence in Hong Kong, a balance can be struck," he told reporters.

"The Law Society of Hong Kong submitted a lot of professional opinions to the Hong Kong government during the consultation period. And we got the message that the leaders recognised our work and our contribution in safeguarding the rule of law."

Chan added that they sought business opportunities during their visit.

He said his delegation visited the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the General Administration of Sport for the first time, to explain how the SAR's legal profession can provide services for the commercial and sport sectors.]]>

    Surprise checks had been effective: labour officials

    <![CDATA[Labour officials on Friday said special task forces set up to inspect construction sites have initiated more than 340 prosecutions against unsafe practices over the past few months.

The inspection groups, established by the Labour Department following a number of fatal industrial accidents, also issued nearly 800 improvement or suspension notices, after conducting checks on almost 660 sites between November 2023 and February this year. 

At a special Legco Finance Committee meeting, lawmaker Chau Siu-hung asked if the administration had assessed the effectiveness of the inspection squads and whether authorities plan to deploy them again.

Commissioner for Labour May Chan said in response that the work of inspection squads had been effective. 

"We conduct inspections through the special task forces, and also through other means. We put in a lot of resources to carry out inspections by special task forces. We also hold surprise checks or random inspections. We have yielded results through these surprise checks," Chan said. 

"As to whether we will ask the special task forces to carry out more inspections in the future, we will look into it." 

Meanwhile, deputy commissioner for labour Vincent Fung said officials will do more to promote a revised code of practice for bamboo scaffolding safety which was gazetted on Friday. 

The amendments stipulate that those working on bamboo scaffolds must undergo training and hold a valid certificate. The revised code also prohibits any unauthorised alteration of scaffolds. 

"Considering the time required for the industry to arrange training to obtain the certificates, there will be a grace period of six months on the effective date of the revised [code of practice]. It will take effect on October 19 to allow the industry to have sufficient time for preparation," a department spokesperson said. 

The updated guide was published two months after a large scaffolding collapsed at a construction site in Kai Tak, killing two workers and injuring three others.]]>

    <![CDATA[The trial of Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai on Friday heard he intended to groom a key figure linked to the 2019 unrest, Finn Lau, to become a "political star", but that Lau was cool to the idea.

Testifying for another day as an accomplice witness, paralegal Chan Tsz-wah spoke about a meeting in Taiwan in January 2020 that he, Lai, Lau and others attended.

The trial heard the Apple Daily founder wanted to cultivate Lau by offering him Â£10,000 in living expenses and helping to build a political network, with the aim of causing the collapse of the Chinese government and economy.

Chan said Lai's anti-China policy also included economic blockades and sanctions.

But the court was told that Lau "did not want to become a political star".

Chan also said Lai wanted to support political newcomers in the pan-democratic primaries in the 2020 Legco elections.

The former media tycoon has denied three conspiracy charges relating to collusion with foreign forces and sedition. 

The trial continues.]]>

    <![CDATA[Sacrificing wetlands to build a new technology hub in the northern part of Hong Kong could cause "irreversible damage" to the habitat of endangered black-faced spoonbills, an environmentalist group warned on Friday, although it reported a rise in the number of the rare migratory birds found in the city. 

The Hong Kong Bird Watching Society's director, Yu Yat-tung, said wetlands in Hong Kong could not be reduced further, voicing concerns that filing in fishponds for the San Tin Technopole project could result in the largest wetland loss in the past three decades. 

"We are talking about a zero loss of wetlands. I think this is a very important policy for us to work towards wetland conservation," he said. "We need to make sure that no wetland can be lost in any development projects from now on and the future." 

His comments came as an annual census conducted in January by the society found 6,988 of the rare migratory birds across the world â a 5.4 percent rise from the year before â marking the third straight year that such figures surpassed 6,000.

In Hong Kong, 375 were spotted in the latest study, up by a quarter from the previous year. But the number of migratory birds in the territory only made up around five percent of the global population. 

"[The figure] is just returning to the previous, normal range of black-faced spoonbills. In the past 10 years, we could usually have about 300 to 400 black-faced spoonbills wintering in Hong Kong," Yu said. 

"We hope the situation can further improve in the coming future, so we need to do many more wetland conservation activities to make sure this can happen."

Taiwan was once again the top winter destination for black-faced spoonbills, with nearly 60 percent of the bird's worldwide population, even though the total number found there dropped slightly. 

The mainland attracted 1,630 spoonbills this year, while Macau recorded the largest decline of 38 percent.]]>

    <![CDATA[Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Friday said it's not hard for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to meet the requirements for a new social welfare subsidy allocation system which rewards support for government policies. 

Groups would score higher if they had organised or co-hosted activities supporting official policies in recent years. 

At a special Legco Finance Committee meeting discussing the budget, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said people have asked him for clarity on the matter, and he didn't know the answer. 

In response, Sun said the new system encourages NGOs to show their commitment to patriotism, and it doesn't matter what kind of activities are involved, so long as the groups took part.

"We want these NGOs to love our country and love Hong Kong," he told lawmakers.

"For example, for our National Day, or after 'The Two Sessions', the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, maybe the NGOs can organise some seminars to share the ideas proposed in these meetings."

Meanwhile, the minister stressed the government had no plans to scrap the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme for the elderly and the disabled.

The administration has started a review of the system after expenditure for the scheme in the current financial year was projected to increase by 50 percent year-on-year, to more than HK$6 billion.

Sun stressed as officials hope to complete a review this year, they would consider ways to extend the scheme in an affordable manner.

He noted the policyâs intent was to encourage the elderly to go out more, to benefit their mental health and relationships.

The minister said the government was aware there were different views on the issue and it would try to balance them.]]>

    <![CDATA[Cathay Pacific on Friday said it aims to recruit 5,000 more staff this year and reach 80 percent of its pre-pandemic capacity in the second quarter. 

The cityâs flagship carrier said it is most in need of flight attendants and customer service officers including cargo and ground staff. 

Patricia Hwang, the airline's Director People, said it would also expand mainland and overseas recruitment to hire more pilots. 

âIn terms of pilots, right now we have got around 2,900 pilots and we forecast that we need to recruit another 500 to support our rebuild journey and to resume our capacity back to the pre-pandemic level,â she told reporters at a recruitment roadshow event.

âWe have got confidence that we will be able to recruit and attract all the pilots that we need to support our rebuild and of course we will not only recruit from Hong Kong, we will also recruit from the Chinese mainland, as well as different overseas countries.â

Hwang added that more than 100 mainland cabin crew members had been trained and are now providing services since Cathay started hiring from across the border last August. 

A Cathay Pacific pilot union earlier said the carrier is very short of experienced pilots despite its recruitment expansion, warning it could take years for the airline to recover from the pandemic. 

But Nazia, a candidate who applied for a customer service post, expressed confidence in the company's prospects. 

"Obviously, Covid-19 was quite an unfortunate event that everyone had to suffer. So I can understand the different pressures on business and different entities. But honestly, looking forward, I think it would be a long term position for me if I do get into Cathay Pacific. I think it's really reasonable for different firms to lay off staff. But I think right now, Cathay Pacific is also doing quite well," she said. 

Cathay said it wants to achieve full pre-Covid capacity in the first quarter of next year.]]>

    Don't let blunders affect digitalisation: Sun Dong

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, on Friday said he hoped government departments and public bodies would keep rolling out digital services, despite various hiccups over the past year. 

At a special finance committee meeting in Legco discussing this year's budget, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien asked about accountability issues, after seeing problems with apps to do with sports venue booking, tunnel tolls and public exams. 

Tien noted these tech hiccups made it seem as if âMurphy's lawâ was coming true â "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and has gone wrong," he said.

In response, Sun said in recent months, the government had required new services to go through third party stress tests vetted by its top IT office, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO). 

He said the latest problems had made officials think about extending stringent tests to public bodies.

The minister said there are hundreds of government departments and public bodies, so it's impossible for the office to cast an eye on everything, adding the IT teams of some government departments were actually bigger those at the OGCIO.

As authorities continue building a digital government and a smart city, Sun said the system must change, and the future Digital Policy Office to be formed will steer policies, besides offering technical support.

The IT chief said despite the shortcomings, he hopes officials won't "shrink back" and would continue to play their part in the cityâs ongoing digitalisation. 

"All good policies are drawn up on the basis of blunders, painful lessons learned. So we need to look forward, we must not be hesitant because of the blunders and problems," Sun told lawmakers.

Meanwhile, the minister said the government's planned artificial intelligence supercomputer centre at Cyberport would operate under a market-driven model, with clear pricing policies.

He said while the government has yet to seek public funding for the centre, Cyberport has raised funds for the project with help from the administration, because of its urgency and what he called abrupt changes to the international situation last year.

The goal remains for the centre to open this year, Sun said.]]>

    <![CDATA[The government on Friday said it plans to let the Airport Authority install an artificial reef off Chek Lap Kok to enhance ecological and fisheries resources there.

Authorities said the reef would provide shelter and nursery grounds for marine life in northwest Lantau waters.

The project would see around 1,000 artificial reef units deployed around 25 hectares of seabed in the airport's approach area No. 3. 

The project was due to commence mid-year at the earliest and was expected to be completed in the second half of 2024.

Around a dozen artificial reef zones have been installed in Hong Kong waters, including one off Chek Lap Kok that is a feeding station for Chinese White Dolphins.]]>

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, on Friday said the government was on course to beat a target of attracting 1,130 outside firms to invest in Hong Kong within a three-year period. 

At a special finance committee meeting in Legco discussing this year's budget, he said officials enabled 382 firms to set up here last year, and 150 in the first three months of 2024. 

Yau said these companies came from places like the mainland, Japan, Singapore, the UK and the US.

The head of InvestHK, Alpha Lau, said some of these companies might not have made big splashes with their promotional campaigns.

"Some may want to come to Hong Kong, they'd like to use the SAR as a springboard into the mainland market, or some mainland enterprises would like to come here and use Hong Kong as a platform," she told lawmakers.

"But then they want to stay low profile as a result of geopolitical tensions."

Yau also expressed hope the SAR could become a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) this year, which is the world's biggest free trade agreement in terms of GDP.

He told lawmakers it normally takes 18 months for RCEP members to vet applications, and the group only started dealing with the requests in June last year. 

Meanwhile, New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip said she thinks it's not necessary to spend HK$33.5 million on the SAR's Economic and Trade Office in London, urging the government to cut costs.

"[The office in London] is not very useful nowadays... Because the positions of those anti-China politicians are pre-determined. No matter what you say, it's pointless," the lawmaker said.

The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau said in response that not only does the office in London handle affairs in the UK, it's also in charge of matters in other parts of Europe, so officials consider the current deployments to be suitable.

At the same meeting, lawmaker Shang Hailong raised concern  about the use of online media by the government.

Official figures showed RTHK, the government broadcaster overseen by the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, had 1.38 million followers on Facebook as of the end of February, and Shang asked if the number was on the low side.

In response, Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said the station's YouTube channel also had more than one million followers, or 17 rating points in terms of viewership, adding whether that reading was low or not was open for interpretation.

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Erick Tsang, on Thursday said spending around HK$1 billion on last yearâs District Council elections was worth it as it brought great social benefits. 

He made the comment at a Legco meeting discussing this yearâs budget, when pressed by lawmakers why the bill was much larger than previous elections. 

New Peopleâs Party lawmaker Lai Tung-kwok noted that for the polls in 2019 and 2015, election officials only spent some HK$400 million. 

Tsang said for the election last year, a number of new elements were introduced, such as arranging for government appointed district committees, setting up polling stations near the border, selfie spots and a large number of extra counters to give out ballots.

âWe also did much in staff training. All that required manpower. In running an election, a major expenditure is on manpower,â the minister told lawmakers at the special finance committee meeting.

Tsang added that more than a million voters last year, including himself, saved a lot of queuing time compared to the polls in 2019.

Therefore, Tsang said the general social benefits were greater despite the bigger expenditure. 

He also told Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen that while the government spent more on its large-scale promotion of the polls, it was great value for money as the campaign was remarkably effective.]]>

    <![CDATA[The cityâs anti-corruption and antitrust watchdogs on Thursday said they had arrested 20 people after cracking down on a syndicate which allegedly engaged in corruption and tender-rigging in relation to building maintenance.

In their first joint operation, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and the Competition Commission said they arrested 17 men and three women aged between 36 and 70 years old. 

The arrestees included the mastermind and other important members of the syndicate such as engineering contractors, engineering consultants, middlemen, members of the Ownersâ Corporation, and staff of property management firms.

Computers, mobile phones, as well as bidding documents in relation to the building maintenance projects were among the items seized.

The antitrust watchdog said it exercised compulsory powers when searching some 40 premises with court warrants to require the relevant parties to present documents and information, during which some members refused to do so.

Companies and persons involved were alleged to have engaged in bribery and anti-competitive activities, manipulating the tendering process for building maintenance projects, exaggerating contracts sums, and assisting associated contractors to obtain the contracts, violating the Competition Ordinance.

The projects covered two residential estates and residential-commercial composite buildings on Hong Kong Island, as well as four residential and industrial buildings in the New Territories, amounting to HK$180 million.

Some of the single projects involved suspected bribes of over HK$1 million.

While half of the renovation projects were yet to be awarded, works of the remaining projects started before the two bodies commenced their investigations.

The ICAC and Competition Commission said that further enforcement action would not be ruled out as the investigation was still ongoing.]]>

    <![CDATA[Security minister Chris Tang on Thursday said it was undesirable that the owners of a building where a fire killed five people last week had failed to follow orders to improve safety measures for 16 years.

Another 40 people were injured in the blaze at New Lucky House in Jordan, several of them critically. 

At a special finance committee meeting in the legislature on this year's budget, a number of lawmakers pressed Tang on the issue.

Councillor So Cheung-wing, of the Election Committee, asked why the building's owners had not been prosecuted despite not improving facilities such as fire safety doors, or using fire resistant materials to wrap power cables.

Lawmaker Ambrose Lam asked why guesthouses in New Lucky House were given licences despite the building owners failing to follow fire safety orders. 

Tang said in response that officials had followed up on the matter over the years, but the building owners had set the issue aside after forming an owners' corporation.

He added that buildings without fire safety facilities that meet modern standards aren't necessarily dangerous.

"Through legislative amendments, we've enhanced the standard of fire safety of these buildings to a modern standard," Tang told lawmakers.

"But it doesn't mean that these old buildings are too dangerous for residents to live in. It just means that the fire safety standard is not up to the modern standard and we are requiring them to catch up."

The minister noted that officials are working on changing relevant laws so that if owners do not carry out improvement works as ordered, the government could do the work for them and then bill them for the cost. 

Another amendment, Tang said, involves raising the maximum fine for violating fire safety laws by four times to HK$100,000, with offenders also risking bigger daily fines for non-compliance.

Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien asked if further penalties would be levied besides a fine, noting that of nearly 300,000 notices issued to homeowners by the Fire Services Department, nearly two thirds had not been complied with.

The minister said in response that it's difficult to single out the individual responsible for fire hazard issues such as problems with fire safety doors and blocked fire escape routes.]]>

    <![CDATA[RTHK's English-language news team on Thursday won the prize for best business technology reporting at this year's Hang Seng University Business Journalism Awards.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the news team reported on a story showing how AI could be misused, with some fraudsters using deepfake technology to defraud others.
  
They ran a special experiment and interviewed cybersecurity experts, police and lawyers to explore how people could protect themselves and ask who should be responsible for preventing the misuse of this technology.

Speaking at the awards ceremony, Professor Simon Ho, President of Hang Seng University, noted that AI has brought both obstacles and opportunities to the media industry.

"In recent years, AI has brought profound changes to the world. We need professionalism, knowledge and independent thinking to ensure the quality and trustworthiness of news," he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's unemployment rate rose to 3 percent in three-month period ending in March, according to official figures released on Thursday. 

That's a 0.1 percentage point increase compared with the December-to-February period. 

Another 9,400 people became jobless during the first quarter of 2024, with officials noting that there were 111,700 unemployed persons in the three-month period ending in March. 

Meanwhile, the underemployment rate edged up slightly to 1.1 percent. 

In a statement, Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rate was generally low despite the uptick. 

"The unemployment rates of most sectors increased in January - March 2024 compared with the preceding three-month period, but stayed low in general," he said. 
 
"As the economy continues to grow, the labour market will likely remain tight in the near term."]]>

    'High-dose steroids a risk for hepatitis B patients'

    <![CDATA[The Coroner's Court on Thursday heard that high doses of steroids had increased the risk of a hepatitis B relapse in a liver disease patient who died following two organ transplants in 2017.

Tang Kwai-sze had been taking the steroid prednisone for weeks before her operations at Queen Mary Hospital. 

Dr James Fung, a transplant hepatologist at the hospital, said a high dose of steroids would suppress a person's immune system, leading to viral replication and a higher chance of virus relapse.

Fung added that prescribing antivirals to hepatitis B patients alongside a large dosage of steroids reduces the chance of relapse. 

At the hearing, Tangâs eldest daughter Michelle Wu questioned whether it was common knowledge among doctors that they should prescribe antiviral drugs for hepatitis B carriers on a high dosage of steroids.

In response, Fung said doctors should know the risks of not prescribing the antiviral drugs, but it also depends on whether there were any instructions on site.

Two doctors at United Christian Hospital who treated Tang, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were found guilty of professional misconduct for allegedly failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.

Lam earlier told the court that he didn't prescribe the drug because he was distracted by "phone ringing" and "people entering the consultation room" at the time.

The hearing was set to continue on Monday.]]>
