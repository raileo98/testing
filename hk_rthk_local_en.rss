    <![CDATA[The government on Friday said it plans to let the Airport Authority install an artificial reef off Chek Lap Kok to enhance ecological and fisheries resources there.

Authorities said the reef would provide shelter and nursery grounds for marine life in northwest Lantau waters.

The project would see around 1,000 artificial reef units deployed around 25 hectares of seabed off the airport's approach area No. 3. 

The project was due to commence mid-year at the earliest and was expected to be completed in the second half of 2024.

Around a dozen artificial reefs have been installed in Hong Kong waters, including one off Chek Lap Kok that is a feeding station for Chinese White Dolphins.]]>

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, on Friday said the government was on course to beat a target of attracting 1,130 outside firms to invest in Hong Kong within a three-year period. 

At a special finance committee meeting in Legco discussing this year's budget, he said officials enabled 382 firms to set up here last year, and 150 in the first three months of 2024. 

Yau said these companies came from places like the mainland, Japan, Singapore, the UK and the US.

The head of InvestHK, Alpha Lau, said some of these companies might not have made big splashes with their promotional campaigns.

"Some may want to come to Hong Kong, they'd like to use the SAR as a springboard into the mainland market, or some mainland enterprises would like to come here and use Hong Kong as a platform," she told lawmakers.

"But then they want to stay low profile as a result of geopolitical tensions."

Meanwhile, Yau also expressed hope the SAR could become a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) this year, which is the world's biggest free trade agreement in terms of GDP.

He told lawmakers it normally takes 18 months for RCEP members to vet applications, and the group only started dealing with the requests in June last year. 

New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip, for her part, said she thinks it's not necessary to spend HK$33.5 million on the SAR's Economic and Trade Office in London, urging the government to cut costs.

"[The office in London] is not very useful nowadays... Because the positions of those anti-China politicians are pre-determined. No matter what you say, it's pointless," the lawmaker said.

The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau said in response that not only does the office in London handle affairs in the UK, it's also in charge of matters in other parts of Europe, so officials consider the current deployments to be suitable.]]>

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Erick Tsang, on Thursday said spending around HK$1 billion on last year’s District Council elections was worth it as it brought great social benefits. 

He made the comment at a Legco meeting discussing this year’s budget, when pressed by lawmakers why the bill was much larger than previous elections. 

New People’s Party lawmaker Lai Tung-kwok noted that for the polls in 2019 and 2015, election officials only spent some HK$400 million. 

Tsang said for the election last year, a number of new elements were introduced, such as arranging for government appointed district committees, setting up polling stations near the border, selfie spots and a large number of extra counters to give out ballots.

“We also did much in staff training. All that required manpower. In running an election, a major expenditure is on manpower,” the minister told lawmakers at the special finance committee meeting.

Tsang added that more than a million voters last year, including himself, saved a lot of queuing time compared to the polls in 2019.

Therefore, Tsang said the general social benefits were greater despite the bigger expenditure. 

He also told Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen that while the government spent more on its large-scale promotion of the polls, it was great value for money as the campaign was remarkably effective.]]>

    <![CDATA[The city’s anti-corruption and antitrust watchdogs on Thursday said they had arrested 20 people after cracking down on a syndicate which allegedly engaged in corruption and tender-rigging in relation to building maintenance.

In their first joint operation, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and the Competition Commission said they arrested 17 men and three women aged between 36 and 70 years old. 

The arrestees included the mastermind and other important members of the syndicate such as engineering contractors, engineering consultants, middlemen, members of the Owners’ Corporation, and staff of property management firms.

Computers, mobile phones, as well as bidding documents in relation to the building maintenance projects were among the items seized.

The antitrust watchdog said it exercised compulsory powers when searching some 40 premises with court warrants to require the relevant parties to present documents and information, during which some members refused to do so.

Companies and persons involved were alleged to have engaged in bribery and anti-competitive activities, manipulating the tendering process for building maintenance projects, exaggerating contracts sums, and assisting associated contractors to obtain the contracts, violating the Competition Ordinance.

The projects covered two residential estates and residential-commercial composite buildings on Hong Kong Island, as well as four residential and industrial buildings in the New Territories, amounting to HK$180 million.

Some of the single projects involved suspected bribes of over HK$1 million.

While half of the renovation projects were yet to be awarded, works of the remaining projects started before the two bodies commenced their investigations.

The ICAC and Competition Commission said that further enforcement action would not be ruled out as the investigation was still ongoing.]]>

    <![CDATA[Security minister Chris Tang on Thursday said it was undesirable that the owners of a building where a fire killed five people last week had failed to follow orders to improve safety measures for 16 years.

Another 40 people were injured in the blaze at New Lucky House in Jordan, several of them critically. 

At a special finance committee meeting in the legislature on this year's budget, a number of lawmakers pressed Tang on the issue.

Councillor So Cheung-wing, of the Election Committee, asked why the building's owners had not been prosecuted despite not improving facilities such as fire safety doors, or using fire resistant materials to wrap power cables.

Lawmaker Ambrose Lam asked why guesthouses in New Lucky House were given licences despite the building owners failing to follow fire safety orders. 

Tang said in response that officials had followed up on the matter over the years, but the building owners had set the issue aside after forming an owners' corporation.

He added that buildings without fire safety facilities that meet modern standards aren't necessarily dangerous.

"Through legislative amendments, we've enhanced the standard of fire safety of these buildings to a modern standard," Tang told lawmakers.

"But it doesn't mean that these old buildings are too dangerous for residents to live in. It just means that the fire safety standard is not up to the modern standard and we are requiring them to catch up."

The minister noted that officials are working on changing relevant laws so that if owners do not carry out improvement works as ordered, the government could do the work for them and then bill them for the cost. 

Another amendment, Tang said, involves raising the maximum fine for violating fire safety laws by four times to HK$100,000, with offenders also risking bigger daily fines for non-compliance.

Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien asked if further penalties would be levied besides a fine, noting that of nearly 300,000 notices issued to homeowners by the Fire Services Department, nearly two thirds had not been complied with.

The minister said in response that it's difficult to single out the individual responsible for fire hazard issues such as problems with fire safety doors and blocked fire escape routes.]]>

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the news team reported on a story showing how AI could be misused, with some fraudsters using deepfake technology to defraud others.
  
They ran a special experiment and interviewed cybersecurity experts, police and lawyers to explore how people could protect themselves and ask who should be responsible for preventing the misuse of this technology.

Speaking at the awards ceremony, Professor Simon Ho, President of Hang Seng University, noted that AI has brought both obstacles and opportunities to the media industry.

"In recent years, AI has brought profound changes to the world. We need professionalism, knowledge and independent thinking to ensure the quality and trustworthiness of news," he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's unemployment rate rose to 3 percent in three-month period ending in March, according to official figures released on Thursday. 

That's a 0.1 percentage point increase compared with the December-to-February period. 

Another 9,400 people became jobless during the first quarter of 2024, with officials noting that there were 111,700 unemployed persons in the three-month period ending in March. 

Meanwhile, the underemployment rate edged up slightly to 1.1 percent. 

In a statement, Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rate was generally low despite the uptick. 

"The unemployment rates of most sectors increased in January - March 2024 compared with the preceding three-month period, but stayed low in general," he said. 
 
"As the economy continues to grow, the labour market will likely remain tight in the near term."]]>

    'High-dose steroids a risk for hepatitis B patients'

    <![CDATA[The Coroner's Court on Thursday heard that high doses of steroids had increased the risk of a hepatitis B relapse in a liver disease patient who died following two organ transplants in 2017.

Tang Kwai-sze had been taking the steroid prednisone for weeks before her operations at Queen Mary Hospital. 

Dr James Fung, a transplant hepatologist at the hospital, said a high dose of steroids would suppress a person's immune system, leading to viral replication and a higher chance of virus relapse.

Fung added that prescribing antivirals to hepatitis B patients alongside a large dosage of steroids reduces the chance of relapse. 

At the hearing, Tang’s eldest daughter Michelle Wu questioned whether it was common knowledge among doctors that they should prescribe antiviral drugs for hepatitis B carriers on a high dosage of steroids.

In response, Fung said doctors should know the risks of not prescribing the antiviral drugs, but it also depends on whether there were any instructions on site.

Two doctors at United Christian Hospital who treated Tang, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were found guilty of professional misconduct for allegedly failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.

Lam earlier told the court that he didn't prescribe the drug because he was distracted by "phone ringing" and "people entering the consultation room" at the time.

The hearing was set to continue on Monday.]]>

    HA says mainland nurses doing well in SAR hospitals

   <description>
    <![CDATA[The Hospital Authority (HA) on Thursday said the second batch of mainland nurses participating in an exchange programme were integrating well into their new work environments, with some already carrying out tasks under supervision.

The 100 Guangdong nurses participating in the GBA Specialty Nursing Knowledge-Exchange Programme are spending 10.5 months until next January, working in various departments at public hospitals. 

The programme's first phase concluded in February with 70 participants and a focus on elderly care.

This phase sees the nurses deployed in more specialist wards, including cardiac intensive care, ophthalmology, endoscopy, perioperative care, and intensive care units (ICU). 

Danny Tong, the HA's chief manager of nursing, praised the nurses’ performance and adaptation to their new work environment, saying some, like those in ICU, had already started working alongside their local peers instead of just observing. 
 
He also explained they are required to be supervised one-on-one throughout the scheme, but hoped they would still gain meaningful work experience. 

“We have to find a sweet spot in how to facilitate, even though the Nurse Registration Ordinance has not been reviewed, and according to the legal framework, they have to be working under supervision,” he said. 

"Actually, there's lots of methods they can [still use to] exercise their expert knowledge." 

He said the HA had arranged nurses from the first batch to mentor the newcomers. 

Tong also noted there’s a glossary of medical terms in both Chinese and English to help with their understanding of the Hong Kong-specific terminology.

Sampson Chan, a local ICU nurse, agreed that there were some initial language barriers, but he praised the mainland nurses for their positive attitude and a strong desire to learn.

He shared an example of mainland nurses staying after work to observe a special procedure involving repositioning a ventilated patient.

“On that day, they [the mainland nurses] are almost off duty, but the patient requires this procedure and they're eager to learn. They stay behind and then they talk with us and then they learn how to turn a patient from the supine position to a prone position with the ventilator. This really impresses me about their attitude and ability,” he said. 

The HA said about 130 Guangdong nurses would participate in the third phase of the scheme. The authority added it plans to discuss with its Guangdong counterparts about sending local nurses to mainland hospitals to learn about rare cases not commonly seen in Hong Kong.]]>

Questions for the English listening exam were said to have been uploaded to Xiaohongshu. 

Police said a 23-year-old woman is suspected of violating the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority Ordinance.

The authority said it is following up on cases involving exam papers being made available publicly, but it believes the leaks only occurred after the exams in question had already taken place. 

"Initial findings indicate that the cases involving the online posting of DSE examination papers occurred after the completion of the respective subject examinations. Therefore, the confidentiality of the DSE has not been affected," it said in a statement.

The authority reminded examination staff not to reproduce or publish the content of exam papers in any form.]]>

    <![CDATA[Dozens of technology enterprises from around the world have been lured to Hong Kong in the past six months, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday.  

The firms will expand their businesses in the SAR and bring talent with them, Lee said.

He made the remarks as 59 local, mainland and overseas enterprises, including big names such as AstraZeneca, Tencent Cloud and China Mobile, signed Memoranda of Understanding with the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park.

At a ceremony, Lee said the signings were a milestone in the city’s journey to become an innovation and technology hub. 

“These enterprises and their enterprising partners will help to attract talent and investment, cultivate industry collaboration, facilitate market access and provide many other services essential to an undertaking as ambitious and far-reaching as this one,” Lee said.

Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, a non-executive director of AstraZeneca, Tony Mok, said the pharmaceutical giant will focus on developing a cancer therapy at the I&T park.

"Chinese University actually had already the first GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) approved facility for cellular product production. So, I think there's a potential great synergy. And, I think this is one of the major directions that we will be looking at, that is the development of cellular therapy in Hong Kong."]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong’s retired trains are set to make a comeback in a showcase exhibition at the end of this month.

One of them, the “Yellow Head” train, is a first-generation electric train for the East Rail Line that retired 25 years ago. 

The trains will feature prominently in the “Station Rail Voyage” exhibition at Hung Hom Station from April 27 to the end of the year.

Rex Auyeung, chairman of the MTR Corportation, said more than a hundred other pieces of artifacts would also go on display, adding the exhibition aimed to take visitors down memory lane.

"People are anticipating to see the ‘Yellow Head’ train, the mid-life refurbishment train that retired two years ago, and the Diesel Electric Locomotive Number 56, will continue to connect with the community. Even though these trains have retired, they have been given a second life," he said. 

"Also, many current and retired colleagues have generously donated and lent railway artifacts to share their railway stories. Taking everyone through the past of Hong Kong’s railways, I hope people can feel the railway experience when visiting the exhibition."

Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Lam Sai-hung, who was one of the officiating guests, said watching the construction of the East Rail Line was a significant part of his childhood.

He added that technological development and progress has brought innovation and improvements to railway operations.]]>

    <![CDATA[People moving into light public housing face estimated monthly management fees of around HK$1,000 because the charges also cover other facilities that accompany the new units, the government said on Thursday.

In Legco, DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng expressed concern that tenants won't be able to afford such fees.

Housing Secretary Winnie Ho explained that the charges are a "three-in-one approach" the government has adopted.

"For light public housing, we don't just have [fees for] cleaning and security guards, there's also provision of services. When we consulted people about light public housing, we were told that people wanted facilities at [these] estates," Ho told legislators.

For example, she said, the cost of operating transport facilities and a promenade at the Siu Lam light public housing project will be added to the management fees.

Meanwhile, legislator Scott Leung said he was concerned that most of the modular units, for people on the waiting list for public housing, are designed for one or two occupants when a good number of families living in sub-divided flats are three-person households.

Ho said data from operators of transitional housing showed that the demand for bigger flats is higher in urban areas and officials have planned accordingly when drawing up the light public housing projects.

The housing chief also dismissed a claim by Election Committee lawmaker Wendy Hong that government policies encourage young people to give up on upward social mobility and simply "lie flat".

Hong said some people even stop working so as to stay eligible for public flats.

Ho responded by saying that the public housing system doesn't encourage young people to queue for a flat, but provides homes for grassroots and elderly people.]]>
