    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong has expressed strong dissatisfaction against remarks made by the US State Department regarding the banning of a protest song in the SAR, calling it a blatant interference in the city’s judicial proceedings. 

A spokesman with the office said in a statement that SAR officials had made the right and necessary move to ban people from using the song to incite others to separate Hong Kong from the rest of the country, or insult the national anthem.  

The statement noted that the SAR government and the High Court had fulfilled their constitutional responsibility to protect national security as well as the dignity of ‘March of the Volunteers’.

The spokesman advised certain politicians to respect the basic principles of international relations and stop interfering in Hong Kong as well as China’s internal affairs. 

The US State Department’s spokesperson, Matthew Miller, had earlier described the Court of Appeal’s temporary injunction order to ban ‘Glory to Hong Kong’ as “the latest blow” to the SAR’s international reputation.]]>

    <![CDATA[The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), Xia Baolong, said the central government will continue to support the SAR's development into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre.

Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, met Xia in Beijing on Thursday, to brief him on Hong Kong’s efforts in attracting strategic I&T enterprises and talent, as well as the city’s latest developments in areas like digital economy.
 
Xia said the SAR government's work deserves full recognition, and that Beijing will continue to support Hong Kong.

Sun, for his part, said the SAR administration will "live up to its mission" and continue strengthening I&T co-operation with different mainland cities.

Separately, Xia also met with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung, and expressed the need for Hong Kong to continue developing the tourism sector. 

Having experienced profound changes in both the internal and external environment, he said the city's travel industry needs to identify new ways to boost growth. 

The HKMAO chief added that the SAR should adopt the strategy of "tourism everywhere", and develop new routes and products to consolidate Hong Kong's reputation as the best travel destination.]]>

    Mixed views on revised employment agency rules

    <![CDATA[There’s been mixed reaction to the government’s revised code of practice for employment agencies that is in part drawn up to deter foreign domestic helpers from "job-hopping".

Under the rules, agencies cannot offer money to encourage helpers to terminate their contracts early. 

They also need to clearly brief jobseekers on immigration rules regarding changes of employer.

The chairwoman of the Hong Kong Employers of Overseas Domestic Helpers Association Betty Yung, welcomed the changes, saying it will be made very clear to workers that they should aim to complete their two-year contract. 

"I think this will at least help to give a very clear concept to all domestic helpers that they should complete the contract because they have signed two years, right?” she said. 

Yung added that the renewed guidelines will have a deterrent effect on agencies. 

She told RTHK that during the pandemic, some companies had encouraged helpers to switch jobs to boost income. 

"During the period when there were no planes, some agencies had to do their business. They had financial difficulties, so they tried to make business by encouraging some helpers to change jobs."

On the other hand, Sringatin, who chairs the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union, said the revised code of practice may discourage helpers from leaving a bad working environment.

"In this kind of situation, domestic workers are very vulnerable. They are reluctant to make a report because of language barriers," she explained.

"They have the right to switch jobs in Hong Kong, and that is not clear in the guidelines. [It should be clearly spelled out] what domestic workers need to do if they experience [bad] working conditions."

Sringatin said however that the revised code, which bars agencies from disclosing, posting or displaying publicly sensitive information about jobseekers, their families or former employers, will better safeguard their privacy.]]>

    EOC issues practical guide for guide dogs

    <![CDATA[The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) on Thursday said it issued a practical guide to foster greater acceptance of guide dogs and their users with visual impairments in society.

The EOC conducted interviews with four guide dog users in October last year, and it found that some interviewees experienced disrespectful acts, such as being rejected from entering some premises. 

Guide dog user Koonie Chan said many people had misunderstandings about guide dogs, and more education was needed. 

"They can't differentiate whether it's guide dog or a pet dog... I got really frustrated. I asked [the waiters], and they said 'You can’t come in because you got a dog'," she said.

The EOC said people were allowed to bring their guide dogs into places like restaurants, MTR trains and franchised buses, but there’s no legal protection to ensure guide dogs could enter premises like schools and workplaces. 

But the EOC's executive director Ferrick Chu said public awareness should be further enhanced, before making any moves to improve existing legislation.

"Because of low awareness, because of misunderstanding, the better way to do it is through public education... [Whether] it's necessary to write another piece of legislation to extend protection, I think it's up to the community and the legislature," he said.

There are currently more than 50 trained guide dogs in service in Hong Kong, and the EOC said some universities are looking into using robotic guide dogs to help people with visual impairments.]]>

    <![CDATA[The High Court on Thursday started hearing a bid to overturn the government's approval of an environmental study into plans to build public flats on part of the Hong Kong Golf Club course.

Senior Counsel Benjamin Yu, for the club, told the court that the Environmental Impact Assessment had a lot of deficiencies.

He argued that the government had said it would identify trees on the golf course that could be classified as old and valuable, but no such findings were included in the environmental report.

The barrister said this is "vital" to the whole judicial review.

Yu also said a public consultation exercise had not been carried out properly or fairly, since authorities had been allowed to submit additional information during the assessment, but people's responses to the submissions were not taken into account.

He said had the club had the opportunity to give further comments, it could have pointed out that an additional study was not comprehensive in assessing the development’s impact on the aquatic habitats at the site.

The lawyer noted that critically endangered Chinese Swamp Cypress trees on the golf course are sensitive to hydrological changes, and authorities should tread extra carefully when it is not known how the trees could be affected.

Judge Russell Coleman said the environment should be given “the benefit of the doubt” and should be protected in such situations.

Yu said the report also underrated the site's ecological value, by severely underestimating the different types of bats living there.

He said the report only mentioned one bat species, when a separate study carried out by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department found 17.

Yu added that the golf course, which is more than 100 years old, should be regarded as a site of cultural heritage, even though it is not a declared monument.

He said it is “odd” that the environmental review concluded that the immediate impact of building on the old golf course was “undetermined” when there would be direct changes and heritage would be destroyed.

The government took back 32 hectares of the golf course last year, with a plan to build public housing flats on nine hectares of the land.

The High Court last year suspended the environmental review on an interim basis so the site could be preserved pending this hearing which is set to continue on Friday.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Labour Department on Thursday ordered contractors linked to a fatal accident at the Kai Tak Sports Park to suspend the use of an elevating work platform. 

It said the construction worker, 52, was trapped between the platform and a metal structure as he was inspecting on Wednesday.

The department said officials immediately started an on-site investigation once they were notified about the accident, and issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned to suspend the use of the platform.

"The contractors cannot resume the work until the department is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," it said in a statement.

The department added it would complete a probe into the case as soon as possible, find out if any party was liable and take legal actions if necessary, while recommending improvement measures.

It said it was saddened by the death and expressed its deepest sympathy to his family.

The worker was found unconscious on Wednesday morning and was rushed to Kwong Wah Hospital, where he was later certified dead.]]>

    HK to host global aviation route event next year

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong will welcome thousands of civil aviation leaders next year to explore business possibilities and open new air routes to the SAR, as the city prepares to host a major global airline route convention for the first time in September 2025.

The event - Routes World 2025 - will be organised by the Airport Authority, in collaboration with Routes, which operates global airline and airport networking events and conferences, with a particular focus on world aviation routes.

Speaking at a signing ceremony to mark the collaboration, Steven Small, Director of Events at Routes, expects the event will attract attendees from 150 countries and 250 airlines who seek to expand their global airline route networks.

These, he noted, could bring significant economic benefits to the SAR.

“A typical Routes World event can exceed over US$590 million of economic impact over a three to five year period. That only can take place if it’s part of a strategic plan of growth, and Hong Kong is a fantastic example of that strategic plan,” he said.

“Its location, superb infrastructure, and exciting tourism offerings means that Hong Kong international airport is already recognised as one of the best international aviation hubs globally,” Small added.

Meanwhile, Vivian Cheung, chief operating officer of the Airport Authority, noted the timing of this event is very "ideal" as the city is expected to complete the third runway expansion project by the end of this year, which will enable the city’s airport to serve 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo per year.

“In addition, we are progressing at full speed with the development of what we call ‘the airport city’ to showcase attendees the city’s enormous business potential,” she added.

Airport city is an area under development that would eventually comprise entertainment, retail, and dining facilities, as well as convention and exhibition venues and hotels.

Cheung also noted the authority would take the opportunity to explore the potential for opening new long-haul flights, especially to countries involved in the nation's Belt and Road Initiative.

Prior to the event in 2025, the city will also host a major aviation event — the CAPA Airline Leader Summit, Asia & Sustainability Awards — in November this year.]]>

    'Waste charging should start in August at govt venues'

   <description>
    <![CDATA[A green group has suggested that Hong Kong's much-delayed waste charging scheme should begin as planned on August 1, but only at government-run premises and facilities, other than public housing estates. 

The government earlier conceded that there are still problems with the pay-as-you-throw scheme, which has been tested at 14 locations since last month. 

In an open letter to Legco's environmental affairs panel on Thursday, the Green Earth said officials should start the first phase of the scheme in August, covering government offices, parks and public schools, among other venues.

"Participating government departments should propose clear waste reduction targets, cutting waste by 10 percent within 12 months, while disclosing the manpower expenditure and management costs of relevant premises to the public," it said. 

Edwin Lau, the group's founder and executive director, said the government should set an example and show the public how to reduce waste.

"The government can work out the most effective ways and the most eco-friendly ways to work on this waste charging - how to reduce waste, how to minimise the volume or weight of the waste - so that offices or residential blocks can reduce the volume of the waste, which is the main objective of the waste-charging scheme," he told RTHK.

He added that public education needs to be beefed up to clarify misunderstandings about the scheme.

"Many of the people do not really understand the reason why the government needs to enforce the waste charging law. They complained that waste recycling facilities are far away, not convenient, and they can hardly find a food waste collection facility to dispose of their food waste," he said.

"The government needs to step up public education and enhance the collection network to make it more convenient for the general public."]]>

    <![CDATA[The government on Thursday published a revised code of practice for employment agencies, partly to try to deter foreign domestic helpers (FDH) from "job-hopping".

The move comes after complaints about helpers switching employers within a short period of time during the pandemic.

Under the rules, agencies cannot offer money to encourage helpers to terminate their contracts early. 

They also need to clearly brief jobseekers on immigration regulations regarding changes of employer.

Officials said some of the changes will also better protect employers as consumers, such as requiring agencies to set out in agreements the fees for each service category.

"[They need to] clearly state whether a refund or arrangement for a replacement FDH will be provided where their services are not delivered in full, or the employment contract has been prematurely terminated by the FDH within the two-year contract period," the department said in a statement.

The revised code also bars agencies from disclosing, posting or displaying publicly sensitive information about jobseekers, their families or former employers.

The Labour Department said agencies will be at risk of losing their licence if they or their employees fail to follow the revised code.]]>

    <![CDATA[The head of the city's stock exchange operator on Thursday said average daily trading turnover was improving, paving the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) in the SAR. 

Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said trading volume towards the end of April had reached up to HK$150 billion, and that turnover during the Golden Week holiday period remained strong at over HK$110 billion when mainland markets were closed with reduced capital flows to the territory.

"The stock market's rebound means that we have regained the confidence of investors. This certainly helps more IPOs to get listed smoothly and successfully in Hong Kong," she told reporters. 

She said the number of IPO applications received by the bourse in the first quarter of this year was 30 percent more than in the same period in 2023, with around 100 currently waiting to be listed. 

Chan also noted that many firms had expressed interest after the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced new measures to facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms. 

Leading mainland companies would list in Hong Kong in the near future, which could boost the city's market, she added.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hospital Authority (HA) on Thursday said more than 7,000 medical professionals will gather at the Convention and Exhibition Centre for an annual conference next week.  

Around 160 speakers will share their views on telemedicine, smart hospitals and artificial intelligence during the HA Convention on May 16 and 17. 

Dr Loletta So, who chairs the convention’s scientific programme committee, said this year's edition will be the largest ever. 

“For the scale, it’s actually much larger than last year. I think it’s more than last year. And it’s actually the highest number of all the previous years. So it’s going to be a very big meeting for us,” she said. 

“We mainly focus on the core values of the HA, which is about the people-centred care, professional service, etc. Another main point is about the innovation in our healthcare. So we have something like artificial intelligence, and then we have the telehealth and smart initiatives." 

Eastern Hospital will also report on its latest developments regarding new innovation technologies, such as using artificial intelligence to detect strokes. 

Dr Samuel Lam, a neurosurgery consultant at the hospital, said the technology saves time for doctors because they don't have to go through image scans one by one. 

"It will help us to streamline the whole workflow. For example, when the AI software identifies those high-risk patients, then the intervention team will be alerted immediately in the fastest way," he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's Lo Wai-fung has made history by becoming the territory's first taekwondo athlete to make the Olympics. 

He's headed to Paris this summer in the under 68kg class because an opponent he lost to in a qualifying tournament in March was disqualified. 

The Taekwondo Association said originally, only the two athletes who made the final of the Asian qualifier would reach the Olympics. 

But Lo, 22, is now taking the spot because Ali Reza Abbasi from the Refugee Olympic Team was deemed ineligible.

Both the male and female tournaments have four weight categories, with 16 fighters in each weight class.

The Olympic taekwondo competition begins on August 7.]]>

    <![CDATA[An MTR engineer-turned-lawmaker said on Thursday that a full-day closure of the Kwun Tong line for maintenance is essential, adding that more short-term closures are likely to be required as the network ages.

Gary Zhang, who worked for the corporation before entering politics, made the comments on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme a day after the MTR announced that no trains would operate on the stretch between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on July 28.

"I understand that the replacement work this time has to be carried out at very high levels within the tunnel. And it's very close to the train power supply system" he told RTHK's Samantha Butler: 

"So therefore, it's basically technically impossible to just rely on one night of non-traffic hours to complete the job."

Zhang added that the MTR was confident of completing the work within the allotted time.

He said it was very likely that more such closures would be required as the network's oldest routes, the Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines, reach the end of their design lifespan. Zhang noted that the routes opened in the 1980s and had a design life of approximately 50 years.

He said structural work like that being carried out on July 28 was "very critical to the railway operations safety and the reliability".

Announcing the work yesterday, the MTR said July 28 was chosen because it fell on a Sunday during the summer holiday, when usage was likely to be light.

It noted that the other lines running through the four affected stations would remain open, adding that a free bus services would run between Yau Ma Tei, Ho Man Tin and Whampoa.]]>

    Revamp involving railway police aims to boost policing

    <![CDATA[Police said they are integrating some 300 police officers in the Railway District into five land regions from the middle of this month, in a bid to improve operation efficiency and anti-terrorism efforts. 

After a one-month trial period, officers from the land regions will take over the duties of railway police, including daily patrols and response to railway incidents, in June.

Established in 1985, the Railway District is responsible for maintaining law and order in the railway system.  

Stephen Yu, a district commander of the Railway District, said their work was affected by problems such as MTR service disruptions in the past.

"We see the challenge and we encounter challenges in that by relying solely on the MTR trains as our only means of transportation to respond to rail incidents is difficult and that would hinder our professional response. The public definitely would like to see their reports to be dealt with promptly and timely," he said.

"For example, if there's an incident happening in one of the MTR stations, our officers will encounter problems and difficulty to get to the scene of the incident because of the suspension of the train service. Now, what we think is it would be much easier and it would be much more timely for the officers from the service side to respond. Now, that includes the emergency unit, police tactical unit, and the patrol unit of the service formation."

Under the revamp, the railway police will be overseen by the police headquarters, instead of the Kowloon East regional headquarters.  

The operations wing’s chief superintendent, Pierre Wong, said it does not mean that the long-standing Railway District is being “dissolved”.  

"I won't use the word of dissolving the rail district. What I will use is the enhancement of the policing project because the railway district will subsequently come under the command of the operations wing of the police headquarters. So you can't say it's not existing. It will continue to exist. 

"Our focus is to, through the operation deployment arrangement, enhance the overall capability of our officers. That is our objective."

Officers said they will also combine the railway response team and the counter-terrorism response unit to beef up counter-terrorism efforts.]]>

    Govt to ask online platforms to remove protest song

    <![CDATA[Justice Secretary Paul Lam said the government will ask internet service providers to remove the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong", adding that such a move will not hinder normal journalistic and academic activities.

Speaking to reporters after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order banning the song, Lam said the ruling is not meant to target tech giants such as Google or Meta. 

"So the effect is to persuade the internet service provider not to provide the convenience and not to facilitate the commission of unlawful act. And that also makes it crystal clear that the injunction is not aiming at restricting the normal operation of any internet service provider," he said. 

"Free flow of information is of crucial importance to Hong Kong. This is a core value that we will do our best to maintain and preserve." 

Chief Executive John Lee also welcomed the ruling. 

In a Facebook post, he wrote that the injunction safeguards national security and the dignity of the national anthem. 

Lee said the song was used to incite acts endangering national security and "Hong Kong independence", causing harm to both the SAR and the country. 

In banning the song, the Court of Appeal on Wednesday overturned a lower court ruling last year, with the three judges agreeing with the administration that there was a compelling need to grant an injunction on national security grounds.

The injunction bans anyone "with seditious intent" from playing or performing the song.

Lam added that the court ruling will not lead to unreasonable restrictions on freedom of expression. 

"The Court of Appeal actually conducts the well-known proportionality test to consider whether a grant of injunction would in fact lead to any disproportional or unreasonable restriction on the freedom of expression," the secretary for justice said.

"But after conducting that proportionality analysis, the court came to the conclusion that in all the circumstances, the injunction would not constitute any unreasonable restriction on freedom of expression."

In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular briefing that “preventing anyone from using or disseminating the relevant song with the intention of inciting secession and insulting the national anthem is a legitimate and necessary measure by the SAR government to fulfil its responsibility of safeguarding national security”.]]>

    Maintenance work to close four MTR stations on July 28

    <![CDATA[The MTR Corporation on Wednesday said it would close a major stretch of the Kwun Tong Line for a rare, full-day maintenance operation later this year.  

There will be no service between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on Sunday, July 28. 

Cheris Lee, who heads the corporation's operating and metro segment, said all four stations affected would still be served by either the Tsuen Wan or Tuen Ma lines, while free bus services would run between Yau Ma Tei, Ho Man Tin and Whampoa. 

She said the asset renewal work would be completed in time for people to get to work on the following Monday.

"I think the reason why we chose the 28th of July is because it is in the middle of the summer holiday. We believe that quite a number of citizens will be on holiday on that day, and that students also have no school on that day. We are trying to minimise the impact to the passengers and also to the citizens in the town," she said. 

KH Lee, chief of the corporation's operations engineering maintenance, said they would replace more than 50 large metal hangers used for hanging power cables on the tunnel ceiling of the crossover near Yau Ma Tei Station, adding the work was necessary based on asset condition and life cycle.

"There are lots of complexity not only because of the preparation of those safety precautions, but also all the work associated with this sort of hangar replacement, like in the course of the hangar replacement, we have to relocate and dismantle some of the existing overhead line and also their parts," he said.

"Upon completion of the work, we have also arranged tests to ensure every system is in good order before we resume the service, so there's a reason why we have decided to have a one-day closure together with the two non-traffic hours.That means before and after to complete the work in one go."

He added several stations would need to carry out similar tunnel facility renewal projects in the next three years.

Some people RTHK spoke to said repair work was inevitable for maintaining efficient railway services.

"There needs to be maintenance from time to time as facilities start to age, or there will be more signal failures in the future. That would lead to longer waiting times, which is very troublesome for people," said a man surnamed Wong.

Another man named Tsoi said he would leave earlier than his usual time when using the train that day.

A woman named Lam said she is a bit worried that there will be huge crowds while travelling that day.
 
"It could be quite disruptive to people especially since they are working during travelling hours at some of the busiest stations," she said.]]>

    Court grants injunction over 'Glory to Hong Kong'

    <![CDATA[The Court of Appeal on Wednesday granted a temporary injunction order banning the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong".

In their decision, judges Jeremy Poon, Carlye Chu and Anthea Pang said they agreed with the administration that there was a compelling need to grant an injunction on national security grounds.

The injunction bans anyone "with seditious intent" from playing or performing the song.

The judges said criminal law alone could not achieve the purpose of safeguarding national security regarding the matter, since it is not practicable to bring proceedings against "unidentifiable" people online who commit offences in relation to the song. 

They noted that there had been "widespread and persistent" flouting of the law before and especially after the national security law came into force in 2020.

"Such is the seriousness of the criminal problems that the court must intervene immediately to prevent the continuation of the prevailing unlawful state of affairs; otherwise any further damage to national security would likely to be irreparable," the judgement read.

The judges also said the injunction was necessary to persuade internet platforms to remove "problematic" content.

They agreed with a lower court ruling earlier that the injunction may have “chilling effects”, but said it has addressed concerns about the right to free expression by allowing exceptions for lawful action connected to the song, such as academic and reporting activities.

A lower court had last year rejected the government's bid for an injunction, saying it would be "of no real utility". The Department of Justice appealed against that ruling.]]>

    <![CDATA[Labour minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said professionals who came to Hong Kong through a new admission scheme have created billions of dollars of economic output.

Speaking on the second day of a talent summit in Wan Chai, Sun said the government recently conducted a study to see how they are doing in Hong Kong.

"We estimate that the more than 30,000 people who had arrived here through the Top Talent Pass Scheme in 2023 can bring in about HK$34 billion of direct economic contribution to Hong Kong a year," he said.

"This means they help boost our GDP by around 1.2 percent a year."

The official said many of these professionals moved to the SAR with their young families - with two-thirds of them being under 40 - and helped rejuvenate the city’s ageing society.

Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said a memorandum of understanding newly signed between the 11 cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) would help expats settle in the GBA.]]>
