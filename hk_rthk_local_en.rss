    <![CDATA[World basketball's governing body, FIBA, said on Thursday that it will bring another major tournament to Hong Kong later this year, with the world's best 3x3 men's teams battling it out for the World Tour title. 

The SAR, which hosted Olympic qualifying last month, will stage the final of the World Tour for the first time on November 23 and 24. 

Matthew Li, media director of the local organising committee, said the top 11 teams in the season will automatically qualify for the Hong Kong Final. 

He added that the team representing Hong Kong will also have a chance to participate if they make it through a play-in tournament against the 12th ranked team and the team with the most combined Challenger and World Tour wins.

Li said the event will also have a 3x3 village with local influences from the Cheung Chau Bun Festival.

"This time we are trying to add some more local culture elements to the carnival. We are trying to make some deal or make some discussion with the authorities in Cheung Chau. We will maybe try to make something different, maybe some local culture things to the November event," he said.

"I think as we will have many more international 3x3 events and also FIBA think we will add a showcase for the tour. We hope it will get more international recognition for Hong Kong as a sport city."

This year's World Tour will feature 16 stops with Ub Huishan NE looking to defend their title as two-time reigning champions.]]>

    Survey suggests civil servant pay rises of up to 5.47%

    <![CDATA[Organisers of a survey on pay trends have suggested rises of up to 5.47 percent for civil servants this year, while warning that it would be "premature" for people to presume the administration will adopt their figures.

The survey, based on data gathered from more than 110 private firms, points to rises of 4.01 percent for senior civil servants, 4.32 percent for middle-ranking workers and 5.47 percent for junior staff. 

“The numbers are not themselves recommendations in any way for an increase, decrease or anything. They are factors to be considered among a number of other factors," said Laurence Li, who chairs the Pay Trend Survey Committee.

"I think it's premature to try to forecast how these things will all be put into the pot." 

The government says other factors to consider when looking at pay rises for civil servants are the state of the economy, changes in the cost of living, the administration's fiscal position, pay claims from staff and civil service morale. 

Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service Clement Leung was asked whether different weight will be put on the various factors when making a decision. 

“Each year, in a way, is a separate exercise, because the economic situation, the situation of the government's fiscal position are different. Every time we will have to have two-way communications with our staff side's representatives," Leung said.

“That will be something that we will have to work on in the next few weeks, and particularly, listening to the views of our staff associations on their sentiments and their views on civil service morale, as well as their proposals." 

Last year, senior civil servants received pay rises of 2.87 percent, while those in middle and junior ranks got 4.65 percent. This was roughly in line with the results of that year's pay trend survey.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Immigration Department on Thursday announced new ID card replacement arrangements as it prepares to move its headquarters from Wan Chai to Tseung Kwan O in the middle of next month.
 
From June 11, the new headquarters will start providing services, and the Registration of Persons office in Kwun Tong will also be relocated to Tseung Kwan O. 

"The main services provided by the Registration of Persons Office in Tseung Kwan O include applications for first registration of ID cards, replacement of ID cards due to due to defacement or loss, and amendment of registered particulars on ID cards," said assistant principal immigration officer Wong Ka-yee.

Wong added that the Tseung Kwan O office will also handle the replacement of new smart ID cards during extended service hours.

People who have applied for an ID card change on or before June 8 can collect their cards at a temporary office in Kwun Tong. 

Meanwhile, the Registration of Persons Office at Immigration Tower in Wan Chai will continue to provide ID card replacement services.]]>

    <![CDATA[Some 2,500 policymakers, academics and medical professionals on Thursday gathered at the Convention and Exhibition Centre for a two-day summit on health innovation and investment. 

The "Asia Summit on Global Health", jointly organised by the government and the Trade Development Council, features a series of thematic sessions on the latest trends in different medical sectors.  

In his opening speech, Chief Executive John Lee highlighted the importance of public health.

"Health is wealth. Health is an ever-revolving discipline that affects all of humanity. It affects the lives of every individual in any economy of the world, big or small, rich or poor, liberal or conservative. Public health is the foundation of society and the very basis of humankind to thrive," he said. 

Lee also told the summit that the SAR thrives as an international metropolis that maintains unparalleled connectivity with both the mainland and the rest of the world.

Cao Xuetao, the vice-minister of the National Health Commission, told the same event that Hong Kong has been using its geopolitical advantages to promote healthcare development.  

"As an international centre for finance, shipping, trade, innovation and technology, Hong Kong has actively leveraged its advantage of having the strong support of the country and being closely connected to the world to innovate in medicine and health," he said. 

The mainland official added that it is crucial to work together and explore new opportunities in the field of medicine and health given complex changes in the international situation.]]>

    <![CDATA[The final of the Cheung Chau "Bun Scrambling" competition was held on Wednesday night at 12 midnight on the football pitch of the Pak Tai Temple Recreation Ground in Cheung Chau, rounding off a day of festivities attended by tens of thousands of people.

Firefighter Yip Kin-man was crowned "Bun King" and nurse Kung Tsz-shan won the title of "Bun Queen."

Nine male and three female finalists competed at the same time, clambering up a 14-metre-high mountain covered in 9,000 plastic buns.

They had to fill their own bags with buns totalling the most points within the time limit of 3 minutes, to win the coveted titles.

Kwok Ka-ming, a regular contestant and one of the favourites for the men's title, won the “Full Pocket of Lucky Buns” prize for snatching the most buns.

The Cheung Chau Bun Festival originated as a ritual for people to pray for safety from a plague.]]>

    'HK, Singapore to keep complementary roles'

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong and Singapore will maintain their ties as both “complementors” and “competitors” as they navigate their way through an increasingly complex geopolitical environment, a veteran businessman with cross-market experience in both places said on Wednesday. 

The remarks came as the Lion City ushered in a new era, with finance minister Lawrence Wong becoming the city-state’s first new prime minister in 20 years, taking over from Lee Hsien Loong who becomes senior minister of the cabinet.

“I think it's very positive,” said Dennis Chiu, chairman of the Hong Kong Singapore Business Association (HSBA). 

“He [Wong] really reflects the meritocracy system of Singapore, because he came from the very bottom of the ladder and then worked his way all up. He is very much a student of the Singapore system to show that.. in Singapore, anybody has a chance to reach the very top,” Chiu said.

When asked how the new leadership might impact the business ties between the Lion City and the SAR, Chiu, who is also the executive director of Far East Consortium International and has straddled Hong Kong and Singapore for three decades, said he expects there will be “continuity” in terms of trade and business cooperation between the two places.

“Singapore and Hong Kong have always played a complementary and competing role. And when you compete, you actually pick up good points from the other, so I think we are mutually learning from each other, but we also compete for the same dollar of investments,” Chiu said.

“I really don’t see there will be huge changes, but I think we will perhaps see how changes in the world will affect Hong Kong and Singapore,” he added, warning that geopolitics has become the most challenging factor affecting all economies, especially open economies like the two cities.

“You have to be neutral and to not choose a side,” he said.

The real estate veteran also said Hong Kong and Singapore could continue to cooperate in areas such as technology and digitisation, adoption of artificial intelligence, and green transition.

“Hong Kong, frankly speaking, has the huge market of China and the Greater Bay Area, [but] Singapore has Southeast Asia as its very important market. Those will always be the strengths of both of the cities’ finances,” Chiu added.

“I think he [Wong] will be able to continue to carry on Lee's systems with him, we do not expect any new changes for the time being, but we want to see how he will be tested when new issues, such as Covid and international crises, come up,” he said. "This is something we all do not know."]]>

    'Fare rise gives cabbies few thousand more a month'

    <![CDATA[A taxi trade representative on Wednesday said cabbies are expected to earn thousands of dollars more every month when fares go up, but the sector is experiencing high operating costs and a change in passenger habits. 

From July 14, there will be a HK$2 increase in flagfalls, meaning the starting fares will be HK$29 for urban taxis, HK$25.5 for New Territories cabs and HK$24 for Lantau taxis. Incremental charges will also rise.

Ng Kwan-shing of the Taxi Dealers & Owners Association said he believes the fare rises will mean cab drivers will earn around HK$100 extra for each shift, or an additional several thousand every month. 

But he told an RTHK programme that both insurance and car maintenance cost more now, and that it's been challenging for nighttime taxi drivers. 

"Because passengers have changed their habits, there's been less business. I hope that after the fare hike, the government could help with the financial situation, allowing more individual visitors [to Hong Kong], so that we could get more business," Ng said.

On the same programme, Transport Commissioner Angela Lee ruled out the taxi trade's suggestion of a regular mechanism to review fare rates. 

"The taxi trade understands its own operating situation best... They may not submit [an application] every year, and it depends on changes to its operations and whether there is a need to ask for fare adjustments," Lee said. 

"Every time we receive [an application], we will handle it cautiously and act as the gatekeeper. I think this approach has always been taken and is effective. So we don't have any plans to change it for the time being."

Lee added that how much cabbies earn is not the sole factor in deciding on fare adjustments.]]>

    <![CDATA[Children dressed up as Hong Kong celebrities, star athletes, deities and even government officials on Wednesday as thousands of people flocked to Cheung Chau for the island's annual bun festival.

Queues formed from the morning at shops offering buns stamped with peace messages, with sellers pleasantly surprised by the turnout. 

"We expected that there would be a drop of 10 to 20 percent in the visitor numbers when compared with last year. But the situation is better than our expectations," said one storekeeper surnamed Kwok. 

"I think people want to experience the festive vibe, while hoping this can bring them peace and luck."

A man surnamed Wong told RTHK he was waiting patiently to get his hands on more than 10 buns in different flavours, for him and his family. 

"I have waited for an hour. But I'm fine with queuing. It's not a big deal. It's just once a year. I've been coming to the festival for 12 years, since 2012," he said.

"I just hope everything goes smoothly and I wish for good health. The Cheung Chau residents believe that, so I just follow the local customs."

One of the main highlights of the festival, the Piu Sik Parade, got underway in the afternoon, with children dressed up as various characters making their way through the island's streets on stilts.

Mini versions of star fencer Cheung Ka-long and swimmer Siobhan Haughey were in the Olympic spirit ahead of the upcoming Paris Games, while there were also sightings of Dragon Ball characters and Hong Kong singer and actor Aaron Kwok. 

One child played security minister Chris Tang and another came as Executive Council convenor Regina Ip to explain Article 23 laws to the crowds.

Another child was decked out as an officer of the Environmental Protection Department, on duty to promote the city's planned waste charging scheme.

Alice, an exchange student in the SAR, hailed the atmosphere of the parade. 

"There's the drumming, all the little kids, everyone's smiling, happy. I like the lion dancers, the dragons. It's really nice, it's a really good day, lots of sun, so it's good fun. I'm staying around till the bun climbing," she said.

Indian tourist Azaira told RTHK the parade was "phenomenal".

"It's amazing, something I've never seen. But I think most importantly, it's the effort that everyone has taken to make this day so special," she said.

"I know it's Buddha's birthday and the costumes, the time, the effort that's taken to put into this. And of course the walking around in this heat.... I love it."

    <![CDATA[The chairman of the Social Workers Registration Board has stressed that the statutory body reviews every application on a case-by-case basis, after the government suggested the board might have erred in renewing and approving licences from people who had committed serious crimes. 

On Tuesday, the Executive Council approved a plan to reform the statutory body overseeing social workers, increasing the amount of appointed members and enabling "the prompt removal" of social workers convicted of serious offences. 

Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Wednesday said there was an urgency to make legislative amendments, and that there were "very obvious cases" that had deviated from the spirit of the law in the eyes of the public. 

“Let's say the board approved the renewal of someone who was involved in drug possession or trafficking. I am not saying this is wrong. But it was not reasonable to approve the application, when many people within the Social Workers Registration Board had strong opinions and huge concerns about it," Sun told an RTHK programme.

The board's chairman, Ng Yut-ming, argued on the same programme that people who had done something wrong in the past should be given a second chance. 

"From the day the board was formed till now, we still review every single application on a case-by-case basis. Even if someone has a criminal record, we will still consider [the application]," Ng said. 

"Some people had committed crimes when they were young. But after many years and undergoing social work training, they had reflected and changed... Even among recipients of 'Ten Outstanding Young Persons' were people who had committed crimes like drug possession or trafficking. Does it mean society should not give them the opportunity to change?" 

The proposed reforms will increase the number of board members from the current 15 to 27, with all required to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.

Seventeen members will be appointed, eight will be elected and there will be two social welfare officials.]]>

    <![CDATA[A Tin Shui Wai secondary school says a teacher who failed to return as scheduled on Sunday from a study trip to the mainland came back to Hong Kong the following day. 

The Education Bureau earlier said the teacher in question didn't make it back on May 11 after a four-day mainland study tour to Wuhan for new hires. It said it would require the teacher and the school to submit a report on what happened.

CUHKFAA Thomas Cheung Secondary School said late on Tuesday that the teacher returned to the SAR on the morning of May 12. 

"The school has reported the incident to the incorporated management committee and established an investigation committee to follow up on the matter," it said. 

"The school is also maintaining close contact with the Education Bureau to learn about and handle the relevant incident. No further comments will be made at this stage."

Internet users had claimed that a secondary school teacher from Hong Kong had been arrested during a trip to Wuhan.]]>

The action comes after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order last week banning the 2019 protest song.

Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said the injunction helps define the red line and provides a stronger deterrence against those who would use the song as a tool to promote "Hong Kong independence".]]>

    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said China is gravely concerned about the prosecution in the UK of three people allegedly working for Hong Kong's intelligence service, and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the country.

“For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.

“China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.”

Britain on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to the UK to state that espionage and cyberattacks were not acceptable on its soil.

The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ambassador Zheng Zeguang had been called to a meeting to be told that “the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyberattacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.”

The Chinese Embassy in London accused Britain of fabricating the charges against the three men.

Zheng said the UK should not interfere in Hong Kong and China's affairs, and should stop making anti-China political provocations.

He also said Britain should not provide refuge to wanted criminals. (Agencies)]]>

    Mixed reactions to approved taxi fare increases

    <![CDATA[People are divided over the authorities' move to approve an increase in taxi fares, with some saying the rise is affordable and others complaining about poor taxi services.

The Executive Council has approved a HK$2 increase in flagfalls, meaning from July 14, the starting fares will be HK$29 for urban taxis, HK$25.5 for New Territories cabs, and HK$24 for Lantau taxis. Incremental charges will also rise.

A student RTHK spoke to in Kowloon Tong said the fare increase is acceptable. However, he acknowledged that frequent taxi users may not be happy. 

"I am not a frequent user, so I think it is still affordable. But for some people, they may travel quite frequently on taxis. This may be a consideration for them," he said.  

A mother who often takes her children by taxi thinks that taxi drivers deserve a higher income for their hard work. 

"I don't think it's a big deal. I think they deserve more money because they work really hard and very long hours. Life has become more expensive, so we have to also expect that this increase needs to happen for the drivers, right?" she said. 
 
A passenger said that taxi drivers should improve their services before they are allowed to increase their fares. 

"The price is a bit high considering their performance. The taxi service is so bad in Hong Kong. Nowadays, we don't have a way to reflect the performance of the taxi drivers. If they behave badly, we don't have a way to complain," he said. 

A taxi driver said he's worried that the fare hike could lead to a further drop in passenger numbers. 

"My concern is that if fares increase, we might see a drop in the number of passengers. Business is already tough, especially during the evening shift when fewer people go out."

However, another taxi driver believes passengers will find the fare increase acceptable. 

"I think it's a reasonable increase. Passengers will eventually get used to it. Considering inflation, a slight rise in taxi fares should be acceptable to them," he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Taxi fares are set to go up after the Executive Council approved increases for cabs on Tuesday, but it was far from the jump the trade had asked for. 

The industry had suggested a HK$5 increase in the flagfall for urban taxis, and set the initial charges for other cabs at HK$28.

Instead, the flagfall for urban taxis will increase from HK$27 to HK$29, while the starting rates will be HK$25.5 in the New Territories and HK$24 on Lantau.

The incremental charges will also be raised, with a 20-cent increase per metre jump for the first-tier distance after flagfall for urban taxis. Passengers of green and blue cabs will see the incremental rates after flagfall rise from HK$1.7 to HK$1.9. 

For second-tier distances, there will be an increase of 10 cents for all three types of taxis. 

The new fares are expected to take effect from July 14 after negative vetting by the Legislative Council. 

A government spokesperson said it is important to review taxi fares to ensure a stable supply of services to cater for passengers' needs. 

"The taxi trade is facing genuine difficulty in maintaining the financial viability of its operation at the current taxi fare level," a statement read. 

"The taxi trade hopes that an increase in taxi fares would raise the income of front-line drivers and attract more newcomers to join the industry, while at the same time encouraging taxi operators to improve their services and invest more in new facilities, thereby enhancing the overall taxi service quality and fostering the healthy development of the trade in the long run."

The government also noted the approved increases were lower than the levels proposed by the taxi trade, adding the fare hike would “inevitably lead to higher transportation expenses for passengers”.

Taxi charges last went up in July 2022.]]>

    Exco endorses plan to reform social worker board

    <![CDATA[The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a plan to reform the statutory body overseeing social workers that will change the composition so that appointed members outnumber those elected. 

Speaking on the revamp, Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun said the sector doesn't need to worry about the autonomy of the Social Workers Registration Board.

At present, six of the board's 15 members are appointed, eight are elected and there is one official from the Social Welfare Department.

In future, 17 members will be appointed, eight will be elected and there will be two social welfare officials.

Last week, Sun said governance of the body must be improved because it has deviated from the spirit of the law. He said, for example, the board had appointed to its disciplinary body a social worker who was facing a charge of rioting.

Sun told reporters on Tuesday that in future, all board members must take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.

"The board exercises public authority. What this means is that the registration of Hong Kong's 27,000 social workers, the disciplinary hearings involving them, all these are to do with public authority," he said.

"So requiring members of a statutory body exercising such authority to swear allegiance, this is only natural. It will ensure that members can safeguard our national security and that they uphold the Basic Law and bear allegiance to the SAR government."

Sun said at least 14 of the 27 members of the board in future will be social workers.

"Everyone needs to understand that the source of social workers should actually be diverse. Some of them would be elected, others would be appointed," the minister said.

"The diversity at the board means that some of the social workers might be renowned professors, some might be respected leaders at social welfare organisations. This would allow for the board's operations to be more diverse and balanced."

He added that the board will also be tasked with setting continuing professional development requirements for the sector.

The government added in a statement that the relevant legal changes, if passed by lawmakers, will enable "the prompt removal" of social workers convicted of serious offences.

It said the proposed legal changes will be gazetted on Friday, with a bill to be tabled to the legislature on May 22.]]>

    'HK keen to promote global cooperation for prosperity'

    <![CDATA[Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Tuesday said that Hong Kong is well-positioned to promote global collaboration and contribute to world prosperity, as the city kicked off its first-ever conference with a focus on geopolitics.

Speaking at the inaugural “Global Prosperity Summit 2024”, Ip warned that Hong Kong faces a “high degree of global geopolitical risks” due to the looming threats of “rising polarisation and political violence”.

She said these threats were challenging global governance, and have led to protectionist policies of tariff hikes, financial sanctions and export controls to “deny developing countries’ access to advanced technology”.

“The world is being factored into opposing geopolitical blocks, the free trade and investment environment over the past decades, which have helped hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, seems to belong to a bygone era,” Ip said.

“With national elections in 64 countries, affecting 49 percent of the world’s population, taking place this year, politics seems to trump economics everywhere,” she added, noting that signs of polarisation and political violence were also on the rise.

Ip said Hong Kong has a keen interest in promoting ways to resolve such issues, as it is a small but open economy that has a high degree of exposure to global risks.

“We are a very international and cosmopolitan society, and we are very well-connected. We understand the cultures and political systems of mainland China as well as the culture and systems of the West, so we are well positioned, really, to maximise our role as a super connector and an intermediary between mainland China and the rest of the world,” she told reporters.

Separately, Ip told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme the SAR is a very suitable place to host the prosperity summit given its reputation as a meeting point between East and West.

“This summit showcases Hong Kong as a platform for international dialogue and communication, because we are able to bring together experts, prominent scholars, former senior officials from all over the world to debate on the issues,” she told RTHK.

“When we have a free trade investment environment, everybody benefits, and we don’t want this to stop,” she added.

The three-day summit event is sponsored by local businesses and the government and is co-hosted by the think tank Savantas Policy Institute which Ip chairs, covering topics such as de-globalisation, technological cooperation and climate change.]]>

    Advances in imaging tech gives hope to stroke patients

    <![CDATA[A study from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Tuesday showed that more than a third of stroke patients who were treated beyond the traditional six-hour golden period had recovered well, offering hope to those once thought untreatable. 
 
The researchers studied more than 50 stroke patients who were treated beyond six hours, with the most notable case being a patient who was treated 22 hours after his stroke.

One of the HKU researchers, Associate Professor of Surgery Kevin Cheng, explained that the key to this medical breakthrough lies in advances in imaging technology, which now allows doctors to assess the proportion of brain cells that can be saved, enabling more targeted interventions.

"In the past, if we just base on a plain CT scan, we cannot estimate the area of the brain having damage. We can just see if there is any blood," he said 

"But with the advancement in the CT perfusion, we can differentiate...which part of the brain is still salvageable and the total volume and the mismatch ratio. So these factors are very accurate and can help us to accurately differentiate those patients who can benefit."

Acute ischaemic stroke is caused by a blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain. Brain cells can quickly die while the flow of oxygen and nutrients is restricted, leading to loss of brain function, paralysis, speech problems and even death.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) on Tuesday said the SAR saw 3.4 million visitor arrivals in April – a 17 percent increase year-on-year.

It said provisional figures show about 2.5 million of the arrivals, or 73 percent, were from the mainland.

The HKTB said there was an increase of more than 50 percent in arrivals from other countries compared to April last year, with a more than 80 percent rise from Indonesia, driven by the end of Ramadan.

Meanwhile, visitor arrivals from long-haul markets such as the US and Canada increased by more than 80 percent year-on-year.

The HKTB said about 14.6 million visitor arrivals were recorded in the first four months of the year, which was double the figure from the same period in 2023.]]>

    Interfering with HK's trade offices will backfire: CE

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that any attempt to interfere with the legitimate operations of Hong Kong’s Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) would only end up harming the economies of the countries that take such action.

He was speaking after a manager of the government’s ETO in London, Bill Yuen, was arrested with two others on suspicion of breaching Britain's national security law and charged with assisting Hong Kong intelligence officers.

"Any attempt to interfere with the work of the ETOs in different places will be against free trade and free economy, and will be harming the economy of the countries that try to do bad things to the operation of the ETOs," Lee said.

He told reporters that the duties of the trade offices are to liaise with foreign officials, businesses, think tanks and representatives of various sectors, to boost links and promote the economic and trade interests of the SAR.

"Any attempt to make unwarranted allegations against the SAR government is unacceptable," the chief executive said.

"The ETOs will of course pursue their duties full-heartedly and legitimately."

He also noted that the the Chinese Embassy in Britain has made serious representations to UK officials, while the SAR government is still waiting for British authorities to respond to its demand for more information on the allegations.

The Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the SAR has accused Britain of arbitrarily arresting Chinese citizens and slandering the Hong Kong government, saying this violates the principles of international law.

Lee also said a photo of him and Yuen that is circulating online was taken more than two decades ago to mark their graduation from the Australian School of Policing.

The CE said that is the only impression he has of Yuen.]]>

    Tourists from 8 mainland cities to get HK$200 vouchers

    <![CDATA[Tourists hailing from eight mainland cities will be welcomed with HK$200 vouchers for restaurants and shops, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.

Last week, the central government added eight new cities, including Urumqi, Hohhot and Heilongjiang to the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS), allowing residents to travel to the SAR without joining a tour group.

Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he expects visitors from the eight cities to provide a large boost to Hong Kong's tourism sector.

"The IVS is the main source of tourists for Hong Kong. It contributed 60 percent of all mainland tourist arrivals last year. The eight cities come with large populations and they also have significant economic growth, with high spending power," he said.

"The eight cities are located in the north, northwest and northeast of China respectively. They are further away from Hong Kong, when compared with the other cities under the IVS. This will bring in a lot of overnight visitors, largely increase per capita spending, and revenues from tourism and related sectors will increase exponentially."

Lee said the authorities have a series of measures to attract more tourists, including the HK$200 vouchers.

He added that a drone show at the weekend received rave reviews.

"Our purpose is to let locals and visitors feel the joy, when they participate in these activities. We hope to use activities to bring liveliness, and use liveliness to bring more money," he said.]]>
