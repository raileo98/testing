    <![CDATA[Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Erick Tsang, on Thursday said spending around HK$1 billion on last year’s District Council elections was worth it as it brought great social benefits. 

He made the comment at a Legco meeting discussing this year’s budget, when pressed by lawmakers why the bill was much larger than previous elections. 

New People’s Party lawmaker Lai Tung-kwok noted that for the polls in 2019 and 2015, election officials only spent some HK$400 million. 

Tsang said for the election last year, a number of new elements were introduced, such as arranging for government appointed district committees, setting up polling stations near the border, selfie spots and a large number of extra counters to give out ballots.

“We also did much in staff training. All that required manpower. In running an election, a major expenditure is on manpower,” the minister told lawmakers at the special finance committee meeting.

Tsang added that more than a million voters last year, including himself, saved a lot of queuing time compared to the polls in 2019.

Therefore, Tsang said the general social benefits were greater despite the bigger expenditure. 

He also told Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen that while the government spent more on its large-scale promotion of the polls, it was great value for money as the campaign was remarkably effective.]]>

    <![CDATA[The city’s anti-corruption and antitrust watchdogs on Thursday said they had arrested 20 people after cracking down on a syndicate which allegedly engaged in corruption and tender-rigging in relation to building maintenance.

In their first joint operation, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), and the Competition Commission (CC), said they arrested 17 men and three women aged between 36 and 70 years old. 

The arrestees included the mastermind and other important members of the syndicate such as engineering contractors, engineering consultants, middlemen, members of the Owners’ Corporation, and staff of property management firms.

Computers, mobile phones, as well as bidding documents in relation to the building maintenance projects were among the items seized.

The antitrust watchdog said it exercised compulsory powers when searching some 40 premises with court warrants to require the relevant parties to present documents and information, during which some members refused to do so.

Companies and persons involved were alleged to have engaged in bribery and anti-competitive activities, manipulating the tendering process for building maintenance projects, exaggerating contracts sums, and assisting associated contractors to obtain the contracts, violating the Competition Ordinance.

The projects covered two residential estates and residential-commercial composite buildings on Hong Kong Island, as well as four residential and industrial buildings in the New Territories, amounting to HK$180 million.

Some of the single projects involved suspected bribes of over HK$1 million.

While half of the renovation projects were yet to be awarded, works of the remaining projects started before the two bodies commenced their investigations.

The ICAC and Competition Commission said that further enforcement action would not be ruled out as the investigation was still ongoing.]]>

    Chris Tang pressed by councillors over deadly blaze

    <![CDATA[Security minister Chris Tang on Thursday said it was undesirable that the owners of a building where a fire killed five people last week had failed to follow orders to improve safety measures for 16 years.

Another 40 people were injured in the blaze at New Lucky House in Jordan, several of them critically. 

At a special finance committee meeting in the legislature on this year's budget, a number of lawmakers pressed Tang on the issue.

Councillor So Cheung-wing, of the Election Committee, asked why the building's owners had not been prosecuted despite not improving facilities such as fire safety doors, or using fire resistant materials to wrap power cables.

Lawmaker Ambrose Lam asked why guesthouses in New Lucky House were given licences despite the building owners failing to follow fire safety orders. 

Tang said in response that officials had followed up on the matter over the years, but the building owners had set the issue aside after forming an owners' corporation.

He added that buildings without fire safety facilities that meet modern standards aren't necessarily dangerous.

"Through legislative amendments, we've enhanced the standard of fire safety of these buildings to a modern standard," Tang told lawmakers.

"But it doesn't mean that these old buildings are too dangerous for residents to live in. It just means that the fire safety standard is not up to the modern standard and we are requiring them to catch up."

The minister noted that officials are working on changing relevant laws so that if owners do not carry out improvement works as ordered, the government could do the work for them and then bill them for the cost. 

Another amendment, Tang said, involves raising the maximum fine for violating fire safety laws by four times to HK$100,000, with offenders also risking bigger daily fines for non-compliance.

Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien asked if further penalties would be levied besides a fine, noting that of nearly 300,000 notices issued to homeowners by the Fire Services Department, nearly two thirds had not been complied with.

The minister said in response that it's difficult to single out the individual responsible for fire hazard issues such as problems with fire safety doors and blocked fire escape routes.]]>

    <![CDATA[RTHK's English-language news team on Thursday won the prize for best business technology reporting at this year's Hang Seng University Business Journalism Awards.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the news team reported on a story showing how AI could be misused, with some fraudsters using deepfake technology to defraud others.
  
They ran a special experiment and interviewed cybersecurity experts, police and lawyers to explore how people could protect themselves and ask who should be responsible for preventing the misuse of this technology.

Speaking at the awards ceremony, Professor Simon Ho, President of Hang Seng University, noted that AI has brought both obstacles and opportunities to the media industry.

"In recent years, AI has brought profound changes to the world. We need professionalism, knowledge and independent thinking to ensure the quality and trustworthiness of news," he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's unemployment rate rose to 3 percent in three-month period ending in March, according to official figures released on Thursday. 

That's a 0.1 percentage point increase compared with the December-to-February period. 

Another 9,400 people became jobless during the first quarter of 2024, with officials noting that there were 111,700 unemployed persons in the three-month period ending in March. 

Meanwhile, the underemployment rate edged up slightly to 1.1 percent. 

In a statement, Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rate was generally low despite the uptick. 

"The unemployment rates of most sectors increased in January - March 2024 compared with the preceding three-month period, but stayed low in general," he said. 
 
"As the economy continues to grow, the labour market will likely remain tight in the near term."]]>

    'High-dose steroids a risk for hepatitis B patients'

    <![CDATA[The Coroner's Court on Thursday heard that high doses of steroids had increased the risk of a hepatitis B relapse in a liver disease patient who died following two organ transplants in 2017.

Tang Kwai-sze had been taking the steroid prednisone for weeks before her operations at Queen Mary Hospital. 

Dr James Fung, a transplant hepatologist at the hospital, said a high dose of steroids would suppress a person's immune system, leading to viral replication and a higher chance of virus relapse.

Fung added that prescribing antivirals to hepatitis B patients alongside a large dosage of steroids reduces the chance of relapse. 

At the hearing, Tang’s eldest daughter Michelle Wu questioned whether it was common knowledge among doctors that they should prescribe antiviral drugs for hepatitis B carriers on a high dosage of steroids.

In response, Fung said doctors should know the risks of not prescribing the antiviral drugs, but it also depends on whether there were any instructions on site.

Two doctors at United Christian Hospital who treated Tang, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were found guilty of professional misconduct for allegedly failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.

Lam earlier told the court that he didn't prescribe the drug because he was distracted by "phone ringing" and "people entering the consultation room" at the time.

The hearing was set to continue on Monday.]]>

    HA says mainland nurses doing well in SAR hospitals

    <![CDATA[The Hospital Authority (HA) on Thursday said the second batch of mainland nurses participating in an exchange programme were integrating well into their new work environments, with some already carrying out tasks under supervision.

The 100 Guangdong nurses participating in the GBA Specialty Nursing Knowledge-Exchange Programme are spending 10.5 months until next January, working in various departments at public hospitals. 

The programme's first phase concluded in February with 70 participants and a focus on elderly care.

This phase sees the nurses deployed in more specialist wards, including cardiac intensive care, ophthalmology, endoscopy, perioperative care, and intensive care units (ICU). 

Danny Tong, the HA's chief manager of nursing, praised the nurses’ performance and adaptation to their new work environment, saying some, like those in ICU, had already started working alongside their local peers instead of just observing. 
 
He also explained they are required to be supervised one-on-one throughout the scheme, but hoped they would still gain meaningful work experience. 

“We have to find a sweet spot in how to facilitate, even though the Nurse Registration Ordinance has not been reviewed, and according to the legal framework, they have to be working under supervision,” he said. 

"Actually, there's lots of methods they can [still use to] exercise their expert knowledge." 

He said the HA had arranged nurses from the first batch to mentor the newcomers. 

Tong also noted there’s a glossary of medical terms in both Chinese and English to help with their understanding of the Hong Kong-specific terminology.

Sampson Chan, a local ICU nurse, agreed that there were some initial language barriers, but he praised the mainland nurses for their positive attitude and a strong desire to learn.

He shared an example of mainland nurses staying after work to observe a special procedure involving repositioning a ventilated patient.

“On that day, they [the mainland nurses] are almost off duty, but the patient requires this procedure and they're eager to learn. They stay behind and then they talk with us and then they learn how to turn a patient from the supine position to a prone position with the ventilator. This really impresses me about their attitude and ability,” he said. 

The HA said about 130 Guangdong nurses would participate in the third phase of the scheme. The authority added it plans to discuss with its Guangdong counterparts about sending local nurses to mainland hospitals to learn about rare cases not commonly seen in Hong Kong.]]>

    <![CDATA[A woman was arrested on Thursday after one of this year's DSE exam papers was posted on social media.

Questions for the English listening exam were said to have been uploaded to Xiaohongshu. 

Police said a 23-year-old woman is suspected of violating the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority Ordinance.

The authority said it is following up on cases involving exam papers being made available publicly, but it believes the leaks only occurred after the exams in question had already taken place. 

"Initial findings indicate that the cases involving the online posting of DSE examination papers occurred after the completion of the respective subject examinations. Therefore, the confidentiality of the DSE has not been affected," it said in a statement.

The authority reminded examination staff not to reproduce or publish the content of exam papers in any form.]]>

    <![CDATA[Dozens of technology enterprises from around the world have been lured to Hong Kong in the past six months, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday.  

The firms will expand their businesses in the SAR and bring talent with them, Lee said.

He made the remarks as 59 local, mainland and overseas enterprises, including big names such as AstraZeneca, Tencent Cloud and China Mobile, signed Memoranda of Understanding with the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park.

At a ceremony, Lee said the signings were a milestone in the city’s journey to become an innovation and technology hub. 

“These enterprises and their enterprising partners will help to attract talent and investment, cultivate industry collaboration, facilitate market access and provide many other services essential to an undertaking as ambitious and far-reaching as this one,” Lee said.

Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, a non-executive director of AstraZeneca, Tony Mok, said the pharmaceutical giant will focus on developing a cancer therapy at the I&T park.

"Chinese University actually had already the first GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) approved facility for cellular product production. So, I think there's a potential great synergy. And, I think this is one of the major directions that we will be looking at, that is the development of cellular therapy in Hong Kong."]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong’s retired trains are set to make a comeback in a showcase exhibition at the end of this month.

One of them, the “Yellow Head” train, is a first-generation electric train for the East Rail Line that retired 25 years ago. 

The trains will feature prominently in the “Station Rail Voyage” exhibition at Hung Hom Station from April 27 to the end of the year.

Rex Auyeung, chairman of the MTR Corportation, said more than a hundred other pieces of artifacts would also go on display, adding the exhibition aimed to take visitors down memory lane.

"People are anticipating to see the ‘Yellow Head’ train, the mid-life refurbishment train that retired two years ago, and the Diesel Electric Locomotive Number 56, will continue to connect with the community. Even though these trains have retired, they have been given a second life," he said. 

"Also, many current and retired colleagues have generously donated and lent railway artifacts to share their railway stories. Taking everyone through the past of Hong Kong’s railways, I hope people can feel the railway experience when visiting the exhibition."

Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Lam Sai-hung, who was one of the officiating guests, said watching the construction of the East Rail Line was a significant part of his childhood.

He added that technological development and progress has brought innovation and improvements to railway operations.]]>

    Govt defends 'unaffordable' light public housing fees

    <![CDATA[People moving into light public housing face estimated monthly management fees of around HK$1,000 because the charges also cover other facilities that accompany the new units, the government said on Thursday.

In Legco, DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng expressed concern that tenants won't be able to afford such fees.

Housing Secretary Winnie Ho explained that the charges are a "three-in-one approach" the government has adopted.

"For light public housing, we don't just have [fees for] cleaning and security guards, there's also provision of services. When we consulted people about light public housing, we were told that people wanted facilities at [these] estates," Ho told legislators.

For example, she said, the cost of operating transport facilities and a promenade at the Siu Lam light public housing project will be added to the management fees.

Meanwhile, legislator Scott Leung said he was concerned that most of the modular units, for people on the waiting list for public housing, are designed for one or two occupants when a good number of families living in sub-divided flats are three-person households.

Ho said data from operators of transitional housing showed that the demand for bigger flats is higher in urban areas and officials have planned accordingly when drawing up the light public housing projects.

The housing chief also dismissed a claim by Election Committee lawmaker Wendy Hong that government policies encourage young people to give up on upward social mobility and simply "lie flat".

Hong said some people even stop working so as to stay eligible for public flats.

Ho responded by saying that the public housing system doesn't encourage young people to queue for a flat, but provides homes for grassroots and elderly people.]]>

The Education Bureau said the school promptly reported the alleged incident and activated a crisis management team.

    <![CDATA[The Customs and Excise Department on Wednesday said it seized a large batch of suspected smuggled electronic components, goods and waste on April 4, with a total estimated market value of about HK$100 million.

Customs officers arrested a 53-year-old female suspect the following day.

The Customs Department said on April 4, officers detected a suspected case of using an ocean-going vessel to smuggle goods to Malaysia at the Kwai Chung Container Terminals.

Customs officers then mounted an operation and seized a large batch of suspected smuggled goods, including integrated circuits, computer servers, routers, together with a batch of electronic waste, inside a container which was declared as containing aluminum alloy aboard the vessel.

 An investigation was ongoing. 

The arrested woman was released on bail pending further investigation and the likelihood of further arrests was not ruled out.]]>

    Govt changing fire safety priorities after Jordan fire

    <![CDATA[Development minister Bernadette Linn said officials were redeploying resources and reviewing priorities with regards to enforcing fire safety laws, following last week’s deadly blaze in Jordan that killed five people. 

She told lawmakers on Wednesday that more manpower would be deployed to step up prosecution, with a focus on buildings such as those with many guesthouses and subdivided flats as well as those with only one staircase. 

High risk blocks whose owners have not complied with mandatory building inspection orders, she said, would also be given priority. 

Linn conceded that the fire, as well as a number of fallen concrete and large-scale illegal structure cases last year, showed government efforts on ensuring building safety were not good enough.

"The incidents... reflect that owners have not taken government directives seriously, and that the government's enforcement efforts have fallen short," she said at a special Legco finance committee meeting on this year's budget.

The minister said the administration had to "vigorously enhance the effectiveness of law enforcement" to urge homeowners fulfill their responsibilities, while helping owners who need assistance in this regard.

Linn said officials were looking at submitting proposals to amend existing laws this year, which would include changes to streamline prosecution procedures and increase penalties.

Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien agreed it's time to add tougher penalties, noting that no one has been jailed for not complying with mandatory building inspection orders. Owners of New Lucky House in Jordan, he added, had ignored such orders for six years.

Linn said in the past three years, owners convicted of failing to comply with mandatory inspection orders have been fined an average of HK$2,500, with the highest penalty a HK$33,000 fine.

She said while there was a need for tougher penalties, the degree of severity would depend on the seriousness of each case and a balance needs to be struck.

The minister believed illegal structures and not improving fire safety facilities would be among the more serious cases prosecuted in future.]]>

    <![CDATA[A 31-year old man was on Wednesday jailed for six months for sneaking into toilets at Good Hope School and taking photos. 

Cheung Chun-hong, a former senior operations officer at Citybus, earlier pleaded guilty to three counts of voyeurism.

Kowloon City Court heard that Cheung dressed in the uniform of the girls' school and put on make up before sneaking into a toilet there. He was caught by two pupils.

Cheung was found to have planted a camera in the toilet.

He was arrested at an industrial unit in San Po Kong, where police found girls' uniforms, underwear and cosmetics.  

In mitigation, the defendant's lawyer said Cheung was a first-time offender, was remorseful, and was determined to seek professional help to address his issue.

But in sentencing, magistrate Ko Wai-hung said that while cross-dressing is a personal preference, it was intolerable that Cheung had used it to commit crime and satisfy his sexual desires. 

Ko added that the court had to show society's aversion to such offences, as well as protect the privacy of underage students.]]>

    Lawmakers upset over HK's food waste recycling rate

    <![CDATA[Lawmakers have criticised the government over its promotion of food waste recycling, with legislator Tony Tse saying the recycling rate of around five percent was "not good enough".

Discussing the latest government figures at a special Legislative Council Finance Committee meeting on Wednesday, Tse noted that food waste reached 3,300 tonnes a day in 2022, making up a third of the rubbish in the SAR's landfills.

In response, the Director of Environmental Protection, Samuel Chui, said while the food waste recycling rate still hovered at around five percent, officials have been doing more.

He said smart recycling bins have already been placed at some 70 percent of public housing estates, serving 1.5 million residents - and more can be expected soon.

"We are progressively increasing the number of food waste processing facilities in public housing estates," he told lawmakers.

"This August, all public housing estates will be equipped with a smart food waste processing bin that covers over 30 percent of the citizens in Hong Kong."

For private buildings, Chui said they could apply for government funding to install the bins and officials would try their best to help.

While there have been complaints the bins were often full or malfunctioning, Chui stressed that from official data, the bins worked around 99 percent of the time.

During the short periods when they were out of action, he said the machines were either full, or there were signalling issues.

The director reiterated that when the food waste recycling bins were around 70 percent full, management firms or cleaners would be notified to unload them.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hongkongers queued up at cinemas and major movie ticket sites crashed around midday as tickets for "Cinema Day" went on sale on Wednesday.

On Sunday, moviegoers can get discount tickets for just HK$30 as part of the "Happy Hong Kong" campaign to boost consumption and promote tourism. 

At one point, nearly 20,000 people were queuing up on the Broadway Circuit website, while the MCL Cinemas website said the wait could be more than one hour.  

At a cinema in Kowloon Tong, university student Gloria hoped to see more of these promotions in future. 
 
"Because it's really cheap. It's like 50 [percent] discount and I think it's a good time to relax before exams. I think it's good to have more discounts like this because it will attract more customers to buy movie tickets," she said. 

Mrs Li told RTHK the movie discount was a chance to spend more time with her loved ones. 

"It's good. It's cheap and I just want to spend time with my family together. I bought two [tickets] and I will take my kid under three years old [to the movies]," she said. 

However, some people told RTHK the discount was not really attractive due to the limited options at cinemas and the popularity of online streaming services.]]>
