    <![CDATA[A think tank on Thursday said Hong Kong, being an international financial hub, can speed up the development of hydrogen power through financing initiatives that invest in green and sustainable sources of energy.

Civic Exchange made the recommendation in its study of the clean energy source, before the government publishes its strategy on the topic in the first half of 2024 in a bid to de-carbonise the city.

The think tank's research analyst Wing Tsang said the recently released Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance would make it easier for businesses to identify and invest in green hydrogen projects which were completely zero-carbon.

She said the SAR could also learn from South Korea, where green bonds are issued to finance hydrogen infrastructure.

"Hong Kong is an international financial centre, [we] can line up with the banking institutions, the financial institutions, businesses and the government to make the hydrogen transition happen," she told RTHK.

Tsang added the government also needs to address the high costs and insufficient infrastructure of hydrogen energy.

"Hong Kong currently has no secure and stable supply of hydrogen, and we must identify available sources of hydrogen locally and in close proximity to Hong Kong to propel the application of hydrogen."

The think tank also urged authorities to approve more pilot projects to speed up the development and adoption of hydrogen energy in the city.]]>

    New law proposed to help contractors get paid on time

    <![CDATA[The Development Bureau on Thursday proposed legislation to make it easier for contractors in the construction sector to get paid on time.

The bill would allow a contractor to claim payment every month, even if it's not specified in their contract. 

That's a change from the current situation, under which disputes are normally settled only when a contract ends.

The bill would also create a new mechanism for settling disputes. A claimant would be able to take their case to an adjudicator, who would make a decision within 55 days. 

If payment doesn't arrive, the claimant would be able to suspend or slow down work, and extend the construction period.

The bureau said it wants to see disputes settled sooner, so everyone involved can get their money faster. It said contractors should see their finances improve, so they can pay workers on time.

Officials expect the Construction Industry Security of Payment Bill to pass later this year and to take effect next year.]]>

    'Social workers may be banned for life by convictions'

    <![CDATA[The government on Thursday said social workers could in future be banned from the profession for life, if they were convicted of a crime which could warrant a prison sentence.

It is among a series of proposed legal changes the administration said would improve the statutory body overseeing the profession, as it accused the body of deviating from the spirit of the law. 

Officials want to reform the Social Workers Registration Board such that there'd be more appointed members than elected ones, while in future, all 27 board members would need to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR. 

Under the plan, social workers convicted of lesser offences that may be considered to harm the reputation of the profession would also be subject to a permanent expulsion, or a ban of no more than five years as decided by the board.

The person concerned could write to the board within 28 days to oppose the decision.

As for more serious crimes such as national security offences, murder, sex offences and child abuse, the board would promptly expel the social worker unless the whole board votes otherwise.

Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Thursday described the proposals as nothing major, stressing that deregistration decisions would continue to be made by the board.

"We're not amending such broad principles [over deregistration]. What we're saying is that we mustn't and shouldn't wait, and there's a new provision to allow for the prompt removal," he told lawmakers at a special Legco panel meeting on the matter.

Sun also accused the current board of dereliction of duty for not taking any steps to implement legal changes related to national security. 

He said it should have actively gathered information on whether social workers seeking to renew their licences "may have committed security-related crimes".

Still, New People's Party's Judy Chan expressed concern that social services would be under affected after the changes, saying there might be a scenario where a group of social workers were disqualified.

The minister dismissed this, saying he thinks most social workers shouldn't have a problem getting their licences renewed.

Sun also stressed the legal amendments only require future board members to take an oath, rather than all registered social workers.]]>

    Govt unveils new measures to cope with extreme weather

    <![CDATA[The government on Thursday announced a series of measures intended to help Hong Kong cope better with extreme weather, including new arrangements for MTR services when the second-highest typhoon signal is in force.

Trains on overground sections of the network will continue until the end of the line, or at least to a large station where passengers can take shelter, instead of only stopping at the next station when the No 9 typhoon signal is in force. 

Last year, scores of travellers were left stranded at the the airport when Typhoon Koinu forced the suspension of the Airport Express and all bus services. 

"In case the train is already in this open section, we will try to reach the final destination as far as practicable and safety permitting," Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung said at a cross-departmental press conference.
 
"If not, we're now planning to stop at a major station in which that station may be big or may be connected to the mall or other commercial areas so that people or passengers could have a better place for shelter so that they can depart the area when the weather allows."

Meanwhile, Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk warned that people who deliberately and repeatedly put themselves in jeopardy during extreme weather may face fines or even prison. 

Cheuk gave the example of people going onto beaches that are closed, adding that the risk is simply not worth it. 

"What we're aiming to do is dissuade people from having some sort of high risk, very risky activities. If anything happens, it's not just costing them HK$2,000 or 14 days in prison. It will cost their life. It's also endangering the life of my emergency response officers. So what we're saying is do not do something dangerous. Do not put yourself at risk," he said. 

Cheuk also said the observatory will issue advice and warnings to members of the public during adverse weather, adding that a city-wide SMS alert system is only reserved for "unforeseen situations" such as tsunamis. 

Asked about arrangements when water is discharged from the Shenzhen Reservoir, officials said they will alert Hongkongers as soon as authorities across the border start considering such a move.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Children’s Hospital on Thursday said it would open the SAR's first breast milk bank next year. 

It would collect milk from breastfeeding mothers who produce surplus milk, which would then be used to help premature and critically ill babies whose mothers were unable to breastfeed. 

The bank would only accept donations from healthy mothers who don't smoke. 

Dr Lee Tsz-leung, the hospital's chief executive, said the donated breast milk would benefit the health of premature babies.  
 
"It carries significant benefits for pre-term babies. It will reduce complication. It will reduce mortality rate. It will reduce the length of stay in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) and also it will promote the neurological development of these premature babies as well," he said. 

The aim is to collect about 800 litres of milk each year, which would benefit up to 600 newborns.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Consumer Council on Thursday said many mosquito repellents may not deliver on their marketing, with one brand it checked seemingly attracting the insects instead of keeping them away. 

Checks on Cherub Rubs Scatterbugs found that more mosquitos landed on the tester's forearm than before it was applied. 

Of the 25 repellent brands examined, only one sample, containing Deet, passed the test perfectly, with no mosquitoes landing on the tester's arm. 

Some natural or herbal brands repelled certain types of mosquito, but not those that spread dengue fever.

Speaking at a press briefing, Kenneth Chan, the Vice-Chairman of the council's Publicity and Community Relations Committee, said consumers should choose the products carefully.

"Mosquito repellent products with chemical or natural ingredients each have their own advantages and drawbacks. Consumers may consult physicians and pharmacists and choose suitable products according to usage and health conditions," he added. 

Chan also urged the makers of mosquito repellents to list out the ingredients in the label clearly and state whether the product is suitable for children.]]>

    Spam call blocker apps pose privacy risk: watchdog

    <![CDATA[The Consumer Council on Thursday warned that the personal data of people who use apps to block spam callers could be at risk because some of these apps pass on the information to third parties.

The watchdog investigated five such apps and found that two of them uploaded details from the user’s list of contacts onto their databases.

The council found that third parties could then access sensitive details including addresses and the monthly rents the contacts paid. 

It's suspected these were extracted from the contact lists of landlords or property agents who also used the apps. 

The council found that one of the apps would also access up to eight items of personal data, including names, photos and dates of birth, when registered via Facebook. 

Speaking at a press briefing, Kenneth Chan, the Vice-Chairman of the council's Publicity and Community Relations Committee, reminded users to stay vigilant when using these apps.

"Consumers should pay attention to the following when using blocker apps. Read the terms of service and privacy policy before use, and evaluate whether the blocker app is trustworthy and the permission is reasonably commensurate with the functions offered," he added. 

Despite the privacy risk, Chan also called on users to proactively report spam to help apps identify and block the latest telemarketing and spam calls.]]>

    <![CDATA[World basketball's governing body, FIBA, said on Thursday that it will bring another major tournament to Hong Kong later this year, with the world's best 3x3 men's teams battling it out for the World Tour title. 

The SAR, which hosted Olympic qualifying last month, will stage the final of the World Tour for the first time on November 23 and 24. 

Matthew Li, media director of the local organising committee, said the top 11 teams in the season will automatically qualify for the Hong Kong Final. 

He added that the team representing Hong Kong will also have a chance to participate if they make it through a play-in tournament against the 12th ranked team and the team with the most combined Challenger and World Tour wins.

Li said the event will also have a 3x3 village with local influences from the Cheung Chau Bun Festival.

"This time we are trying to add some more local culture elements to the carnival. We are trying to make some deal or make some discussion with the authorities in Cheung Chau. We will maybe try to make something different, maybe some local culture things to the November event," he said.

"I think as we will have many more international 3x3 events and also FIBA think we will add a showcase for the tour. We hope it will get more international recognition for Hong Kong as a sport city."

This year's World Tour will feature 17 stops with Ub Huishan NE looking to defend their title as two-time reigning champions.]]>

    Pay Trend Survey results unveiled

    <![CDATA[Tentative results of a Pay Trend Survey that would help adjust civil service pay were released on Thursday, but organisers said it would be "premature" for people to presume the administration will adopt their figures.

The survey, based on data gathered from more than 110 private firms, points to rises of 4.01 percent for senior civil servants, 4.32 percent for middle-ranking workers and 5.47 percent for junior staff.

“The numbers are not themselves recommendations in any way for an increase, decrease or anything. They are factors to be considered among a number of other factors," said Laurence Li, who chairs the Pay Trend Survey Committee.

"I think it's premature to try to forecast how these things will all be put into the pot." 

The government said other factors to consider when looking at pay rises for civil servants are the state of the economy, changes in the cost of living, the administration's fiscal position, pay claims from staff and civil service morale. 

Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service Clement Leung was asked whether different weight will be put on the various factors when making a decision. 

“Each year, in a way, is a separate exercise, because the economic situation, the situation of the government's fiscal position are different. Every time we will have to have two-way communications with our staff side's representatives," Leung said.

“That will be something that we will have to work on in the next few weeks, and particularly, listening to the views of our staff associations on their sentiments and their views on civil service morale, as well as their proposals." 

Last year, senior civil servants received pay rises of 2.87 percent, while those in middle and junior ranks got 4.65 percent. This was roughly in line with the results of that year's pay trend survey.

    <![CDATA[The Immigration Department on Thursday announced new ID card replacement arrangements as it prepares to move its headquarters from Wan Chai to Tseung Kwan O in the middle of next month.
 
From June 11, the new headquarters will start providing services, and the Registration of Persons office in Kwun Tong will also be relocated to Tseung Kwan O. 

"The main services provided by the Registration of Persons Office in Tseung Kwan O include applications for first registration of ID cards, replacement of ID cards due to due to defacement or loss, and amendment of registered particulars on ID cards," said assistant principal immigration officer Wong Ka-yee.

Wong added that the Tseung Kwan O office will also handle the replacement of new smart ID cards during extended service hours.

People who have applied for an ID card change on or before June 8 can collect their cards at a temporary office in Kwun Tong. 

Meanwhile, the Registration of Persons Office at Immigration Tower in Wan Chai will continue to provide ID card replacement services.]]>

    <![CDATA[Some 2,500 policymakers, academics and medical professionals on Thursday gathered at the Convention and Exhibition Centre for a two-day summit on health innovation and investment. 

The "Asia Summit on Global Health", jointly organised by the government and the Trade Development Council, features a series of thematic sessions on the latest trends in different medical sectors.  

In his opening speech, Chief Executive John Lee highlighted the importance of public health.

"Health is wealth. Health is an ever-revolving discipline that affects all of humanity. It affects the lives of every individual in any economy of the world, big or small, rich or poor, liberal or conservative. Public health is the foundation of society and the very basis of humankind to thrive," he said. 

Lee also told the summit that the SAR thrives as an international metropolis that maintains unparalleled connectivity with both the mainland and the rest of the world.

Cao Xuetao, the vice-minister of the National Health Commission, told the same event that Hong Kong has been using its geopolitical advantages to promote healthcare development.  

"As an international centre for finance, shipping, trade, innovation and technology, Hong Kong has actively leveraged its advantage of having the strong support of the country and being closely connected to the world to innovate in medicine and health," he said. 

The mainland official added that it is crucial to work together and explore new opportunities in the field of medicine and health given complex changes in the international situation.]]>

Firefighter Yip Kin-man was crowned "Bun King" and nurse Kung Tsz-shan won the title of "Bun Queen."

Nine male and three female finalists competed at the same time, clambering up a 14-metre-high mountain covered in 9,000 plastic buns.

They had to fill their own bags with buns totalling the most points within the time limit of 3 minutes, to win the coveted titles.

Kwok Ka-ming, a regular contestant and one of the favourites for the men's title, won the “Full Pocket of Lucky Buns” prize for snatching the most buns.

The Cheung Chau Bun Festival originated as a ritual for people to pray for safety from a plague.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong and Singapore will maintain their ties as both “complementors” and “competitors” as they navigate their way through an increasingly complex geopolitical environment, a veteran businessman with cross-market experience in both places said on Wednesday. 

The remarks came as the Lion City ushered in a new era, with finance minister Lawrence Wong becoming the city-state’s first new prime minister in 20 years, taking over from Lee Hsien Loong who becomes senior minister of the cabinet.

“I think it's very positive,” said Dennis Chiu, chairman of the Hong Kong Singapore Business Association (HSBA). 

“He [Wong] really reflects the meritocracy system of Singapore, because he came from the very bottom of the ladder and then worked his way all up. He is very much a student of the Singapore system to show that.. in Singapore, anybody has a chance to reach the very top,” Chiu said.

When asked how the new leadership might impact the business ties between the Lion City and the SAR, Chiu, who is also the executive director of Far East Consortium International and has straddled Hong Kong and Singapore for three decades, said he expects there will be “continuity” in terms of trade and business cooperation between the two places.

“Singapore and Hong Kong have always played a complementary and competing role. And when you compete, you actually pick up good points from the other, so I think we are mutually learning from each other, but we also compete for the same dollar of investments,” Chiu said.

“I really don’t see there will be huge changes, but I think we will perhaps see how changes in the world will affect Hong Kong and Singapore,” he added, warning that geopolitics has become the most challenging factor affecting all economies, especially open economies like the two cities.

“You have to be neutral and to not choose a side,” he said.

The real estate veteran also said Hong Kong and Singapore could continue to cooperate in areas such as technology and digitisation, adoption of artificial intelligence, and green transition.

“Hong Kong, frankly speaking, has the huge market of China and the Greater Bay Area, [but] Singapore has Southeast Asia as its very important market. Those will always be the strengths of both of the cities’ finances,” Chiu added.

“I think he [Wong] will be able to continue to carry on Lee's systems with him, we do not expect any new changes for the time being, but we want to see how he will be tested when new issues, such as Covid and international crises, come up,” he said. "This is something we all do not know."]]>

    <![CDATA[A taxi trade representative on Wednesday said cabbies are expected to earn thousands of dollars more every month when fares go up, but the sector is experiencing high operating costs and a change in passenger habits. 

From July 14, there will be a HK$2 increase in flagfalls, meaning the starting fares will be HK$29 for urban taxis, HK$25.5 for New Territories cabs and HK$24 for Lantau taxis. Incremental charges will also rise.

Ng Kwan-shing of the Taxi Dealers & Owners Association said he believes the fare rises will mean cab drivers will earn around HK$100 extra for each shift, or an additional several thousand every month. 

But he told an RTHK programme that both insurance and car maintenance cost more now, and that it's been challenging for nighttime taxi drivers. 

"Because passengers have changed their habits, there's been less business. I hope that after the fare hike, the government could help with the financial situation, allowing more individual visitors [to Hong Kong], so that we could get more business," Ng said.

On the same programme, Transport Commissioner Angela Lee ruled out the taxi trade's suggestion of a regular mechanism to review fare rates. 

"The taxi trade understands its own operating situation best... They may not submit [an application] every year, and it depends on changes to its operations and whether there is a need to ask for fare adjustments," Lee said. 

"Every time we receive [an application], we will handle it cautiously and act as the gatekeeper. I think this approach has always been taken and is effective. So we don't have any plans to change it for the time being."

Lee added that how much cabbies earn is not the sole factor in deciding on fare adjustments.]]>

    <![CDATA[Children dressed up as Hong Kong celebrities, star athletes, deities and even government officials on Wednesday as thousands of people flocked to Cheung Chau for the island's annual bun festival.

Queues formed from the morning at shops offering buns stamped with peace messages, with sellers pleasantly surprised by the turnout. 

"We expected that there would be a drop of 10 to 20 percent in the visitor numbers when compared with last year. But the situation is better than our expectations," said one storekeeper surnamed Kwok. 

"I think people want to experience the festive vibe, while hoping this can bring them peace and luck."

A man surnamed Wong told RTHK he was waiting patiently to get his hands on more than 10 buns in different flavours, for him and his family. 

"I have waited for an hour. But I'm fine with queuing. It's not a big deal. It's just once a year. I've been coming to the festival for 12 years, since 2012," he said.

"I just hope everything goes smoothly and I wish for good health. The Cheung Chau residents believe that, so I just follow the local customs."

One of the main highlights of the festival, the Piu Sik Parade, got underway in the afternoon, with children dressed up as various characters making their way through the island's streets on stilts.

Mini versions of star fencer Cheung Ka-long and swimmer Siobhan Haughey were in the Olympic spirit ahead of the upcoming Paris Games, while there were also sightings of Dragon Ball characters and Hong Kong singer and actor Aaron Kwok. 

One child played security minister Chris Tang and another came as Executive Council convenor Regina Ip to explain Article 23 laws to the crowds.

Another child was decked out as an officer of the Environmental Protection Department, on duty to promote the city's planned waste charging scheme.

Alice, an exchange student in the SAR, hailed the atmosphere of the parade. 

"There's the drumming, all the little kids, everyone's smiling, happy. I like the lion dancers, the dragons. It's really nice, it's a really good day, lots of sun, so it's good fun. I'm staying around till the bun climbing," she said.

Indian tourist Azaira told RTHK the parade was "phenomenal".

"It's amazing, something I've never seen. But I think most importantly, it's the effort that everyone has taken to make this day so special," she said.

"I know it's Buddha's birthday and the costumes, the time, the effort that's taken to put into this. And of course the walking around in this heat.... I love it."

    <![CDATA[The chairman of the Social Workers Registration Board has stressed that the statutory body reviews every application on a case-by-case basis, after the government suggested the board might have erred in renewing and approving licences from people who had committed serious crimes. 

On Tuesday, the Executive Council approved a plan to reform the statutory body overseeing social workers, increasing the amount of appointed members and enabling "the prompt removal" of social workers convicted of serious offences. 

Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Wednesday said there was an urgency to make legislative amendments, and that there were "very obvious cases" that had deviated from the spirit of the law in the eyes of the public. 

“Let's say the board approved the renewal of someone who was involved in drug possession or trafficking. I am not saying this is wrong. But it was not reasonable to approve the application, when many people within the Social Workers Registration Board had strong opinions and huge concerns about it," Sun told an RTHK programme.

The board's chairman, Ng Yut-ming, argued on the same programme that people who had done something wrong in the past should be given a second chance. 

"From the day the board was formed till now, we still review every single application on a case-by-case basis. Even if someone has a criminal record, we will still consider [the application]," Ng said. 

"Some people had committed crimes when they were young. But after many years and undergoing social work training, they had reflected and changed... Even among recipients of 'Ten Outstanding Young Persons' were people who had committed crimes like drug possession or trafficking. Does it mean society should not give them the opportunity to change?" 

The proposed reforms will increase the number of board members from the current 15 to 27, with all required to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.

Seventeen members will be appointed, eight will be elected and there will be two social welfare officials.]]>

    <![CDATA[A Tin Shui Wai secondary school says a teacher who failed to return as scheduled on Sunday from a study trip to the mainland came back to Hong Kong the following day. 

The Education Bureau earlier said the teacher in question didn't make it back on May 11 after a four-day mainland study tour to Wuhan for new hires. It said it would require the teacher and the school to submit a report on what happened.

CUHKFAA Thomas Cheung Secondary School said late on Tuesday that the teacher returned to the SAR on the morning of May 12. 

"The school has reported the incident to the incorporated management committee and established an investigation committee to follow up on the matter," it said. 

"The school is also maintaining close contact with the Education Bureau to learn about and handle the relevant incident. No further comments will be made at this stage."

Internet users had claimed that a secondary school teacher from Hong Kong had been arrested during a trip to Wuhan.]]>

    <![CDATA[Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday that it will comply with a court ruling and restrict viewing in Hong Kong of 32 banned links related to the song "Glory to Hong Kong", effective immediately.

The action comes after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order last week banning the 2019 protest song.

Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said the injunction helps define the red line and provides a stronger deterrence against those who would use the song as a tool to promote "Hong Kong independence".]]>

    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said China is gravely concerned about the prosecution in the UK of three people allegedly working for Hong Kong's intelligence service, and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the country.

“For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.

“China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.”

Britain on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to the UK to state that espionage and cyberattacks were not acceptable on its soil.

The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ambassador Zheng Zeguang had been called to a meeting to be told that “the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyberattacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.”

The Chinese Embassy in London accused Britain of fabricating the charges against the three men.

Zheng said the UK should not interfere in Hong Kong and China's affairs, and should stop making anti-China political provocations.

He also said Britain should not provide refuge to wanted criminals. (Agencies)]]>
