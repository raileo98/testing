    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government is aiming to roll out a scheme in the third quarter of the year to encourage people to rejoin the workforce.

Under the Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme announced in his policy address in 2023, elderly and middle-aged people who have not been in paid employment for three consecutive months or more will be entitled to an allowance after working for at least six straight months.

Speaking at an event organised by the Federation of Trade Unions marking the upcoming Labour Day, Lee also said the government will fine-tune the review mechanism of the city's minimum wage, as part of measures to better protect the rights of employees.

He hailed their contributions to the city’s economic and social development, noting that authorities are going all out to stimulate the economy while improving people’s livelihoods.

“This year's Labour Day is the first Labour Day in the SAR after the enactment of Article 23 of the Basic Law... We can [now] spare no effort to fight for the city’s economic growth, pursue development, improve people's livelihoods, and have all wage earners pursue happiness in a safe and stable environment,” he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[The government on Tuesday said it strongly opposed and disapproved of a report by the United States on the human rights situation in Hong Kong last year, calling it "unfounded and biased".

A spokesman of the SAR government said it condemned repeated US attempts to politicise human rights in the so-called annual human rights report by the US State Department.

"The HKSAR government strongly demands that the US immediately stop acting against the international law and basic norms of international relations and interfering in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs," the spokesman said in a statement.

He said the administration is against the wanton slander on Hong Kong where the One Country, Two Systems principle is successfully implemented.

The spokesman added that the SAR's laws on national security clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected.]]>

    <![CDATA[Legco President Andrew Leung on Tuesday said the expanded Legislative Council Complex in Admiralty was expected to come into operation at the end of the year.

Four storeys are being added to accommodate offices for the 20 extra lawmakers who joined Legco as part of electoral reforms in 2021, taking the total from 70 to 90 members. 

Chief Executive John Lee, several government officials, and Leung attended the "topping out" ceremony at Legco and visited the newly built 12th floor, marking a milestone in progress on the expansion of the complex.

Leung said he hopes Legco members can move into the building by the end of the year so that they can work under the same roof. 

Lawmaker Wendy Hong, who is one of dozens of members currently using the nearby CITIC Tower as their temporary office, said it would be more convenient when they moved back to Legco. 

"I look forward to move back soon because now we have meetings in the Legco building, but our office is in another building," she added.

"Sometimes it's difficult for us to arrange [meeting] times. When you have 20, 15 minutes in between two meetings, it's difficult for you to go back to the office and come back [to Legco] again. But now we can go back to office and come back. It's easier to arrange time."

Construction of the new floors began in 2022, with the project costing around HK$400 million more than the original estimate, from HK$1.17 billion to HK$1.56 billion.]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's first-ever trial under a United Nations anti-terrorism ordinance got underway at the High Court on Tuesday, over an alleged attempt to plant bombs and shoot police officers in 2019.
 
Cheung Chun-fu, Cheung Ming-yu, Yim Man-him, Christian Lee, Lai Chun-pong and Justin Hui deny "conspiracy to commit bombing of prescribed objects", while Lau Pui-ying has pleaded not guilty to a conspiracy charge relating to providing or collecting property to commit terrorist acts. 

The prosecution told the court that the defendants had planned to plant two bombs during a rally marking International Human Rights Day in December 2019 – one on Hennessy Road in Wan Chai and the other around 100 metres away. 

The first bomb was designed to make police move to where the second was planted, the prosecution said. 

It said the second bomb was bigger, with a power radius of 400 metres, and it contained 150 iron nails which would have caused serious casualties and property damage had it been detonated. 

The defendants also planned to shoot police officers, the court was told. 

The prosecution told the nine-person jury that Cheung Ming-yu, Hui and Lai received military training in Taiwan in September 2019, and that the trio also went up a hill in Sai Kung to test their guns three weeks before the day of the planned attack, which police say they foiled. 

The prosecution's witnesses for the trial include a co-defendant who pleaded guilty, Wong Chun-keung, who is said to have been the leader of the group behind the alleged bomb plot.

This is the first time that Hong Kong authorities have brought a prosecution using the anti-terrorism ordinance since it was enacted in July 2002.]]>

    <![CDATA[The SAR government's office for attracting skilled workers to the city will host a global talent summit and expo at the Exhibition and Convention Centre in Wan Chai between May 7 and 8, to encourage more people to move to Hong Kong. 

The Director of Hong Kong Talent Engage, Anthony Lau, on Tuesday said nearly 100 firms, public bodies and government departments were expected to take part.

More than 20 people will share their outlooks on the global job market and talent movement trends, as well as opportunities and exchanges in the Greater Bay Area. 

Lau said admission is free, and locals can also take part. The event will be broadcast live online.

He said his office would provide information on different talent entry schemes, as well as support services for non-locals on how they can move to Hong Kong, offering advice on issues such as housing and education for their children. 

Lau noted that in the past year, finance and IT were among the sectors that attracted the most non-local talent to Hong Kong.

"For talent coming to Hong Kong, most of them are very interested in tips on every-day life. They also want more opportunities to learn Cantonese and practice the language," Lau told a press conference.

He said with Cantonese classes being so popular, his office would hold dozens more of them this year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday dismissed the need for legislation against "fake news", stressing the media sector's ability to improve credibility through professionalism and self-discipline. 

Lee acknowledged improvements in the dissemination of accurate information and praised the efforts of journalists' groups to combat misinformation.

He said the media industry is committed to maintaining the integrity of news reporting. 

"We will monitor the situation but my take is that if this problem can be addressed by enhancing professionalism, then it should be our first choice. We need to work together. There is no need for legislation. I always think that we can handle this issue with self-discipline as well as professionalism," he said.
 
The CE's remarks came after Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told the SCMP in an interview that the government has ruled out introducing a fake news law, an idea proposed by the previous administration. 

He said legislation in this area would be challenging due to complex legal issues surrounding the definition of fake news.]]>

    'Similar accident happened at Sha Tin manhole in 2006'

    <![CDATA[A workers' rights group on Tuesday said it is angry about the manhole incident in which two workers died, noting that a similar accident happened at the same site before.

The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said a pair of workers had died in 2006 after working in a manhole on Yuen Wo Road in Sha Tin.

The Construction Industry Employees General Union also said authorities failed to learn lessons from the previous accident, and called on them to review regulations and enforcement practices to get rid of any loopholes.

The association's chief executive Siu Sin-man said the Labour Department should ask construction companies to notify authorities before starting work in a manhole so inspections can take place.

"The system can effectively strengthen the contractors' vigilance because they need to provide many supporting [documents] to the Labour Department to show they have done the best preparations including safety precautions," she told RTHK.

"When the Labour Department knows more about the ongoing projects, there can be better monitoring."

The body said the Drainage Services Department needs to ensure that contractors fully comply with safety standards by conducting risk assessments, installing ventilators and monitoring equipment in the manholes, as well as arranging safety harnesses for workers.

It said it is trying to get in touch with the families of the workers to offer assistance.

    <![CDATA[Police say they are looking into a video showing a man jumping from platform to platform at an MTR station. 

Footage circulating online appears to have been taken by the man himself as he leapt over the train track at Fo Tan Station on Saturday night.

The MTR Corporation called in the police on Monday night after reviewing its CCTV footage.

The company said the two platforms involved are more than two metres apart.

Police said the man carrying out the stunt appears to be between 20 and 30 years old, while CCTV suggests another man of around the same age also filmed what happened.

Officers said the case has been classified as a breach of MTR by-laws. No arrests have been made.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed his condolences to the families of two workers who died in a manhole in Sha Tin. 

Initial investigations showed the pair inhaled hydrogen sulfide and fainted while working in the manhole. They were later certified dead at the hospital.

Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said relevant departments were looking into the accident.

"I know that the Drainage Services Department has started reviewing the safety of similar works, and related works have been suspended," he said.

"We hope the Labour Department can conduct a detailed investigation as soon as possible to look into the cause of the accident. We will wait for the result of the investigation before we take follow up actions."

He added that various stakeholders had the responsibility to prevent industrial accidents from happening.

Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said the investigation would focus on the workers’ decision to enter the manhole.

"Workers should not be asked to enter manholes when they clean the drainage. They just have to spray water with high-pressure from above ground," she said during a Legco panel meeting.

"So why did the workers enter the manhole, leading to fatalities? That is one of the directions of the investigation."

A code of practice for safety and health at work in confined spaces was first introduced in 2000, and the government earlier said it planned to revise the code of practice in the first half of the year.

The Development Bureau said it had suspended the contractors from tendering for public works related to roads and drainage.

"The contractors concerned have to conduct an independent safety audit to review their safety management system. The contractors are required to submit an improvement action plan and implement improvement measures," a spokesman said.

The bureau said the suspension would only be lifted if the contractors demonstrated an effective safety management system.

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that the authorities are ready for an influx of visitors during the mainland's Golden Week holiday next month, with preparations in place at immigration control points. 

Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, Lee said almost six million people are expected to enter or leave Hong Kong via the airport, rail and land crossings in the first week of May. 

He said special arrangements have been put in place for particularly busy periods.

"The TLB (Transport and Logistics Bureau) and the Transport Department have already been in close contact with the transportation operators, so we'll be in full gear to ensure that there will be good and smooth service for visitors," he said. 

"We'll also be turning out officers to take care of the management of tourist groups because we want to spread them out, also to stagger the meal arrangement, so that they will be smoothly absorbed into the whole arrangement at different districts."

Lee added that Golden Week will be a good opportunity to show people that Hong Kong is a vibrant city.

"We want the experiences of the visitors, that of course includes tourists and also maybe a result of the activities of local spenders, to have a good experience, both in taking meals, in shopping, in all kinds of services, businesses," he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the initial response to a ban on plastic tableware has been positive, adding the government would monitor the supply and price of alternative products.

Speaking a day after the first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics took effect, Lee said it takes time for people's behaviour to change. 

"We are aware that these alternatives cost about several cents or 20 cents or so. So they are affordable. I do believe that they will not be too costly in the operation of businesses," he told reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting. 

"There is an international trend to move away from plastic. Alternative products have been developed over quite some time. We have just started the regulation of plastic tableware. We do hope that Hong Kong people will understand that it is our responsibility to protect the environment." 

The CE added the Environmental Protection Department had provided a list of around 700 suitable non-plastic alternatives for businesses. 

The first phase of the ban prohibits the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.]]>

    <![CDATA[An investigation has been launched after two sewer maintenance workers died in a manhole in Sha Tin.

Authorities say early indications are that the pair, and two other men who also fell ill while working in the manhole, inhaled hydrogen sulfide.

The Drainage Services Department said the men were employed by a contractor to clean sewers using high-pressure water jets, but their work should not have required them to enter the manhole.

Firefighters were called at around midnight to reports that the workers had fallen ill while operating three to four metres underground at the Yuen Wo Playground. 

The two men are said to be 26 and 34 years old. They were declared dead at the Prince of Wales Hospital. The two other workers were also treated at the same hospital.

The department said it had ordered a halt to work at the site and paused all similar work elsewhere until it could conduct safety checks. 

It’s also launched an investigation and promised to work with the Labour Department and the police, who are also looking into the case. It's been classified as an industrial accident.]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong is on track to becoming one of the first jurisdictions to adopt sustainability disclosure requirements in line with global standards, as the government vowed to do more to support green energy transition in the region.

Speaking at a forum to mark Earth Day, the finance chief said the government is committed to launching a roadmap this year to align local sustainability disclosure requirements with the International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards.

He also pointed out that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will soon release a local green classification framework that aligns with rules adopted by the European Union and the mainland to combat so-called “green washing”, the act of providing misleading information about products’ environmental benefits.

Separately, Chan noted the SAR could do more to support green transition finance in the region, which would involve investing in green sectors and projects, as well as assisting carbon-intensive industries in their net-zero transformation.

“We have the expertise, infrastructure, and regulatory framework that support international investors and different transition projects,” he said.

“There’s clear room to explore how Hong Kong could better help channel capital to support the transition of high-emitting sectors and heavy polluting industries in the region,” he added.]]>

    <![CDATA[An advisory council on Monday conditionally approved the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the San Tin Technopole project, despite heavy criticism.

Green groups had last week called the report the worst wetland assessment since EIA regulations came into place in 1998.

The Advisory Council on the Environment approved the EIA at a meeting, but it listed eight conditions, including the submission of a habitat creation and management plan (HCMP) to the Environmental Protection Department nine months before pond filling works begin.

Other conditions included setting up wildlife corridors with a diameter of at least ten metres wide, submitting a plan on enhancing wetlands in Mai Po, and setting up an environmental committee to monitor the implementation of ecological mitigation measures.

Terence Tsang, the department's assistant director, said authorities will ensure the eight conditions will be met throughout the development of the tech hub.

"There is a very stringent mechanism to review that submission. Also, if in case the effectiveness of the measures recommended in the HCMP was found to not achieve the expected results... there is some kind of monitoring mechanism," he told reporters.

Green groups said the EIA had missed two species of breeding birds and also did not share the actual number of black-faced spoonbills counted in the survey.

Additionally, they said that the assessment had violated at least 35 statutory requirements and omitted crucial data points.

They also said the report should be resubmitted, as the area for the San Tin Technopole project had been expanded.

But council chairman John Chai said that that would not be necessary as the assessment already covered issues like ecology, fishponds and wetlands.

"Despite that there is a difference in the area, the coverage of the development, the environmental issues that need to be studied have not changed... So in other words, it's the same kind of study," Chai said.   	 

Responding to the development, environmental groups said they were highly disappointed by the decision, stressing that the San Tin Technopole project will cause irreversible damage to wetlands.

In a statement, they said the conditions laid out by the department did not specifically address the deficiencies in the San Tin EIA report, which they regarded as "invalid, incomplete, unscientific, and unreliable". 

Construction work for the tech hub will begin late this year.

    <![CDATA[It is “widely known medical knowledge” that hepatitis B patients taking steroids should also be prescribed antivirals, a renal specialist told the Coroner’s Court. 

Lui Sing-leung, who chairs the Hospital Authority’s central renal committee, also said a doctor who treated liver disease patient Tang Kwai-sze should have detailed the discussions on the use of steroids during a consultation session in his medical notes.

Tang had been taking steroids to treat her chronic kidney disease before she underwent two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017. She died in August that year at the age of 44.

The two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for allegedly failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.

Giving evidence on Monday, Lui said while the Hospital Authority had yet to issue a guideline on antiviral prescription for non-cancer patients at the time of Tang’s steroid treatment, it was “widely known” that such drugs should be given to the patient. 

He also told the inquest, before Coroner Monica Chow and a five-person jury, that Lam’s notes only said the patient was briefed on the “pros and cons of steroids” and agreed to using the drug. 

“Lam should have written down clearly the pros and cons of steroids that he had highlighted, because [relapse] is an important, serious potential complication,” Lui said.

Lui added that doctors who see the same patient subsequently might only rely on the previous medical notes, but not the hospital’s clinical management system.

Chan, the other doctor who later saw Tang, did not follow up with the patient as to why antivirals had not been prescribed when he should have, the court heard. 

Another expert witness, Professor Grace Wong from the Chinese University’s medical school, agreed that a hepatitis B flare-up, in which the level of liver enzymes rises abruptly, is mainly caused by the absence of antivirals during a high-dose steroid treatment.

Wong, a specialist in gastroenterology and hepatology, said a study she’s part of found that even short courses of a large dosage of steroids could increase the risk of a hepatitis flare-up, and such patients should receive antivirals regardless of the duration of the treatment.

She also said while it should be “common sense” to prescribe antivirals along with steroids, the practice was not written “in black and white” before the patient’s case came to light, so one could not expect all doctors to follow as such. 

The inquest hearing continues.]]>

    Plastic ban gets support but 'more can be done'

    <![CDATA[People were generally supportive of the plastic cutlery ban that took effect on Monday, but some said it was inconvenient and restaurants could do more to protect the environment.

Restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils like straws and cutlery, but plastic containers and cups are still allowed for takeaways.

Lamini, an office worker in Wan Chai, said cutting down on plastic products is the right thing to do.

“By removing plastic one by one, I think it can only be positive for our children and future generations. I agree to pay maybe a little bit more to have something made from paper and I think we have to do it now,” he told RTHK.

Nevaeh, a student enjoying a drink at a cafe in Admiralty, said she did not mind using a paper straw, even though it became soft after a while.

“I got used to it because they only provide paper straws, so you’ll just accept it,” she said.

But Luk, a worker, said paper straws just do not work and restaurants should switch to reusable ones, like stainless steel straws, for dine-in customers.

“They should have thought it through and tested the straw first,” he said.

“I could barely drink from the paper straw. I had to take it out and drink from the glass, because it was flattened.”

Michael, the director of a steakhouse in Wan Chai, said he understands that eco-friendly cutlery may not be as useful as plastic cutlery and so he is offering his customers different options when ordering takeaway food.

"If they want plastic tableware it’ll cost them HK$5. Of course people will prefer to dine in if they’re having steak. If they order takeaways they can ask us to slice the steaks for them,” he said.

Meanwhile, the owner of a Vietnamese noodle joint said it will switch to paper pulp cutlery in a week or so, when the stock of plastic tableware is used up.

But she said eco-friendly alternatives are more costly and will make it harder for small businesses to stay afloat.

“It costs around 30 percent more. But the economy is in a tough shape, how can we transfer the cost onto the customers? They may not come if we put up the price,” she said.

“We chose sturdier paper tableware because we serve soup noodles... and they’re more expensive.”]]>

    New growth charts introduced after 31 years

    <![CDATA[Health authorities on Monday said they are updating how they measure children's growth for the first time since 1993 to reflect the fact that today's young people are typically taller and heavier. 

New charts are being rolled out to help check how a child's weight, height, body mass index and head circumference compare with those of their peers. 

Dr Thomas Chung, from the Department of Health, worked with colleagues from Chinese University and the University of Hong Kong. He said there was a clear trend upwards in the height and weight of children and adolescents in the territory.

"When we compare the new charts, HK2020, with that of the old charts, HK1993, the median height of boys and girls at age 18, they are two centimetres taller than those in the median height of the same age in 1993," he said.

"There may be many factors like nutrition, and improvements in society, so this is expected and seen in other places in the world as well."

Chung also said they compared their current data to data routinely collected by the health department to validate and discover trends, adding the pandemic did not affect their results. 

"We collected more than 21,000 data from children and adolescents to construct the new Hong Kong 2020 growth references. These growth charts contain nine centile lines, as compared to the seven centile lines in the old charts," he said.

"The two additional extreme lines help frontline professionals have a more accurate and detailed assessment on the growth of the children, so that they can be referred to other specialists if necessary."

Dr Tony Nelson, a paediatrics specialist from Chinese University, said it was important to check local data instead of relying on global studies.

"In terms of our local data showing that infants are lighter at birth and girls are slightly shorter, I think this just reflects the importance of local data," he said. 

"So our local data shows that for the Hong Kong population, it's not like the WHO study, which was from six countries globally and included countries like the Netherlands, and India, and America, and other places. So I think this just reflects the local genetics, the local population here."

The Department of Health will start using the new growth charts in maternal and child health centres in July, and in student health service centres in September. 

The Hospital Authority will implement them in phases starting in September, and aims to have them in all its facilities by the end of the year.]]>

    '70 percent of eateries still using plastic items'

    <![CDATA[A catering sector leader on Monday said about 70 percent of Hong Kong's 18,000 restaurants are still handing out plastic cutlery, despite the first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics coming into effect. 

The government says it won't issue fines for breaches of the ban over the next six months. 

The president of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, Simon Wong, said many small and medium-sized restaurants are still using plastic, because it's cheaper than alternatives. 

Wong told an RTHK programme that he hopes people will get into the habit of taking their own cutlery with them when they go out for food, so they don't have to pay extra for eco-friendly options.

"The cost may be passed on to some people, because they may have to pay additional fees. However, I hope that people can, in the future, get into the habit of using their own tableware. It would be best if they can bring their own cutlery, as that way neither party needs to consider the matter of cost," he said.

The ban also means hotels can no longer provide guests with free plastic items, including disposable razors, toothbrushes and shower caps.

On RTHK's Backchat programme, the executive director of the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners, Caspar Tsui, said the industry is struggling to find alternative products.

"There has been a little difficulty in changing some of the products. Not because we were not willing to do it, but mainly because, you know, it's difficult to find sufficient suppliers and the quality of products that we need to maintain the service," he said. 

"We're adjusting slowly, not because we don't want to, but it takes time."]]>

    <![CDATA[The 9th Hong Kong Games began on Sunday with an opening ceremony held at the Coliseum. 

Cheerleading, a wushu performance and skateboarding were just some of the spectacles kicking off the biennial sports competition.

Athletes from the territory's 18 districts entered the venue before table tennis players Minnie Soo and Ding Ning, wushu athlete Samuel Hui and badminton player Wang Yilyu took part in a torch relay, lighting the cauldron together to signify the beginning of the games.

Under Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Raistlin Lau gave the opening speech. He said President Xi Jinping has emphasised the importance of sports for improving people's health and realising the Chinese dream.

"The biennial Hong Kong Games is a major sports event for all Hong Kong citizens. This is not only a good opportunity for Hong Kong athletes to show their strength, but also an excellent platform to promote 'Sports for All'," Lau said.

"This year, the Hong Kong Games has entered its ninth session. I know that in the next two months, there will be more than 4,600 athletes competing in eight events and a total of more than 1,000 games."

The inter-district sports event runs until June 9, with competitions in athletics, badminton, 3-on-3 basketball, futsal, swimming, table tennis, tennis and volleyball.]]>
