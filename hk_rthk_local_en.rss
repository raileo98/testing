    <![CDATA[Police said on Saturday that they had arrested a truck driver after an accident at about 4pm in which six people were injured. 

They said a 68-year-old man was driving a minibus along Kam Sheung Rd towards Yuen Long, when it was hit by a truck driven by a 56-year-old man. 

The minibus hit a lamp post and flipped on to its side, but the truck didn't stop. 

Police said the truck driver failed an alcohol test, and was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, drunk driving, reckless driving after a traffic accident and failure to report a traffic accident.
 
Five women and a man were slightly injured and were taken to hospital.]]>

    Over 800,000 mainlanders expected here for Golden Week

    <![CDATA[The Tourism Board's executive director on Saturday said he thinks major events like the Victoria Harbour firework and drone displays will still be a big draw for mainland visitors during the Golden Week holiday. 
 
Speaking on a HOY TV programme, Dane Cheng said he expects more than 800,000 mainland tourists to visit the SAR during the break, but that he doubts the numbers can return to pre-pandemic levels. 

"I think it's unrealistic for Hong Kong to return to the tourist figures of 2018 and 2019. Hongkongers find it difficult to accommodate so many tourists, no matter where they come from. Even when taking public transport like the bus and train, or going shopping, there are many people," he said. 

"It's important to create a good experience for both visitors and locals. Of course visitors hope to have a good experience when they come, and not encounter crowds everywhere they go."

Cheng added that he is in talks with the government and vendors to see whether the revamped Temple Street Night market can be made permanent. 

Last week the Tourism Board announced that the market, part of the government’s "Night Vibes Hong Kong" campaign to spice up the city’s nightlife, would stay until the end of this year.

Meanwhile, the government has announced a series of measures to prepare for the influx of visitors, such as allowing cross-border shuttle buses to increase service frequency and extending the operating hours of the last East Rail Line train to Lo Wu on some days. The MTR also said it would increase train services on seven rail lines, adding a total of 540 train trips during Golden Week. 

The mainland's Golden Week break runs between May 1 and May 5.

    <![CDATA[Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday said security cameras, installed in Mong Kok this month, have helped officers detect two serious crimes. Their installation was the first stage of a government plan to install about 2,000 CCTV cameras across Hong Kong this year.

Speaking to reporters after attending an event, Siu said the surveillance cameras had been effective.

"In just half a month, we detected two serious crime cases with the help of CCTV cameras. One was related to possessing imitation firearms, and we arrested three men. The other one was a robbery case, and we arrested a man within 24 hours," he said. 

"After installing these 15 CCTV cameras, we will see if there’s anything we can improve. We will then install 600 cameras at crime black spots across Hong Kong in the middle of this year."

Asked about privacy concerns, Siu said the Privacy Commissioner had given advice to the government, and that the authorities had also asked an independent consultancy firm to conduct a privacy impact assessment.]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Services Minister Christopher Hui on Saturday said a recent move by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to provide more mainland business for Hong Kong is an opportunity for the SAR's financial sector. 

The measures, announced earlier this month, include opening up more Hong Kong-based exchange-traded funds for mainland investors and encouraging mainland companies to list here.   

Speaking on a radio programme, Hui said the stock exchange is currently processing around 100 listing applications from outside Hong Kong.  

"Through the efforts of our stock exchange and other parties, we have been promoting the advantages of our Hong Kong listing platform to different potential issuers," he said.  

"I believe, with the support of our country's policy, our stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission will continue to work hard and encourage more companies to consider using Hong Kong as a listing platform for their financing."

Asked about a rise in bankruptcy petitions, Hui said he believed this was due to a number of reasons, including high interest rates. 

"This is due to several factors. Of course, some past petitions might come back after the pandemic. At the same time, the economic situation could play a part," he said. 

The treasury chief added that officials would continue to monitor the changes in the figures before deciding whether action was needed.]]>

    Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs

    <![CDATA[The Housing Secretary Winnie Ho on Saturday said the operating costs for light public flats should not be compared with traditional public housing units, as the government prepares to take applications for the first of the flats. 

Responding to a question on an RTHK radio show, she said the new flats have a different set of facilities so an exact comparison cannot be made. 

"For traditional public flats, the operating cost only includes about HK$500 for cleaning and security, and about HK$400 for maintenance and repair work, so it's a total of about HK$1,000," she said. 

"But there are additional social welfare facilities for light public flats, and there are social welfare organisations providing services for residents. For example, there may be a shared living room for residents, and activities for them. Like transitional housing, there are shops, restaurants, or laundry services for residents."

The first batch of the modular temporary units, announced in the 2022 Policy Address to fill the short-term gap in public housing supply, will be completed in Yuen Long in the first quarter of next year. About 2,100 will be available with applications starting in the next few months.

Ho also said she was confident that 30,000 light public housing units would be completed by 2027 at the latest.]]>

    Public adapting quickly to plastic ban: minister

    <![CDATA[Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said the public was adapting quickly to the plastic-free scheme. 

The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban started on Monday, and restaurants are now barred from selling and using plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.

He told a radio programme that authorities had visited about 1,700 retail and catering premises in the past week and almost all of the large chains, and about half of the smaller restaurants, had changed to non-plastic utensils. 

"In terms of effectiveness, many chain restaurants told us that about 60 to 70 percent of customers, who bought takeaway food, didn't need disposable utensils. This phenomenon is very good because one of the aims of the plastic ban scheme was for people to bring their own utensils," he said.

A chain supermarket was found to be selling sushi in paper boxes this week, with people describing it as "sushi in blind boxes".

Tse said it's unreasonable and unnecessary for supermarkets to use non-plastic packaging.

"Supermarkets may allow customers to eat at their tables. People normally think it's considered as dine-in, but in this situation, supermarkets expected customers to take out their food. In reality, a lot of people do take away their food," he said.

"When supermarkets pack their food, they won't know whether customers will choose to take out or dine in... We think that treating this as takeaway is appropriate, according to the regulations."

Responding to the quality of non-plastic utensils, Tse said the ban had just begun, and he believed that restaurants would be able to choose better substitutes later on.]]>

    Non-plastic prices to fall as use increases: minister

    <![CDATA[Environment chief Tse Chin-wan has stressed that a ban on single-use plastics is not meant to trouble people, saying prices for alternatives will go down further when they become more common. 

The first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics took effect on April 22, prohibiting the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates. 

Tse told RTHK's "Your Home Address" programme, which was broadcast on Saturday, that the policy is not intended to make people's lives more difficult but to regulate plastics at source. 

"For those disposable tableware, if you switch to the alternatives, the difference is actually very small, usually one or two cents to a maximum of 50 cents for the whole package. Therefore, it's not very expensive," he said. 

"We expect that as more and more will be used in society, the price will go down further. People's behaviour will drive the development of the alternatives, as well as drive down the price of those alternatives."

The minister also said authorities must find reliable substitutes before expanding the scope of scheme, as he ruled out imposing a blanket ban on plastic products because their use is too widespread. 

"We are not going to ban the use of all plastics at once. That is not possible... We start with those which we already have readily available and mature alternatives," he said. 

On the postponed municipal solid waste charging scheme, the environment minister said there are proven effects of the policy in Seoul, where the amount to garbage produced was cut by 60 to 70 percent in about five to 10 years. 

The government pushed back the implementation of the waste charging to August, while it held trials for the scheme at more than a dozen premises this month.]]>

    Govt lowers Sha Tin Trunk Road estimated cost

    <![CDATA[The government has put forward minor tweaks to the planned construction of a new road in Sha Tin in hopes of cutting the estimated cost of the project by five percent to HK$6.81 billion amid criticism of its hefty price tag. 

In a revised funding request for the Trunk Road T4, the administration said the changes would not affect the functionality of the project. 

"In response to concerns currently about the situation of public finances, we tried to reduce the cost of this project as much as possible," the Legco paper wrote. 

"We hope to win the support of lawmakers so that the project can be carried out in a timely manner and avoid delaying yet again the long-term development of New Territories East and the Northern Metropolis."

Authorities last month withdrew its application to the Legislative Council of more than HK$7.1 billion in funding for the planned T4 project, which connects major roads on both sides of the Shing Mun River, as critics questioned whether the scheme is worth the money.

To cut cost, the government said it will switch to using traditional materials to build noise barriers for the project, which in turn is expected to save HK$120 million. 

"This will not affect the function of noise barriers. Currently, traditional materials are commonly used in other construction projects," it said. 

Other changes include scrapping a proposed elevated cycling track across Shing Mun River, and reducing the number of elevators at footbridges to further shave off around HK$100 million. 

Lawmakers are set to discuss the revised funding request during a Finance Committee meeting next week.]]>

    ICAC sees 30 percent jump in property management cases

    <![CDATA[The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday said it received 30 percent more complaints relating to the property management sector in 2023, compared to the year before.

The watchdog said it received 236 reports, up from 182 in 2022.

Corinna Wong, the ICAC’s director of community relations, said many of the reports last year were linked to repairs and maintenance contracts, with allegations that some were awarded through bribery or that they came with exaggerated price tags.

Other complainants alleged that some property management firms took bribes from jobseekers, or fabricated duty records.

Wong said there were 51 such corruption reports in the first quarter of this year.

She said while there may be "rotten apples" in the industry, the increase in complaints does not mean that the sector has become more corrupt.

“Sometimes after we investigated corruption cases, and they were widely reported by the press, members of the public may become aware of that particular case and then may come forward to report to us similar cases," she said.

"In the property management sector, after the ICAC operations department discovered several cases last year, there was a slight increase in the corruption cases we received."

The anti-graft watchdog said it is working with the Property Management Services Authority to offer training for companies and workers to enhance integrity standards across the sector.

The authority’s vice-chairperson, Eddie Hui, noted that property management workers must now obtain a licence, and that all of them will need to receive training in areas including anti-corruption awareness starting in 2025.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police on Friday said they had enhanced enforcement to combat traffic violations associated with taxis, tour buses and illegal cabs at renowned tourist sites as part of preparations for the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holiday next week.

Speaking at a press briefing near the Peak Tram station in Central, Inspector Lai Cheuk-fung said during the first three months of the year, police had received 23 complaints about taxis, with grievances about over charging commonly cited.

Lai said officers would enhance their enforcement efforts starting from Wednesday this week to May 8.

He said police would also strengthen education by introducing "taxi ambassadors" to provide taxi-related information to travellers.

"Apart from enforcement, we would like to introduce a multi-agency approach to tackle this problem. Apart from tackling the problem in Hong Kong, we would like to consolidate Hong Kong's place as an international tourist destination. And this is our ultimate goal," he explained.

Meanwhile, senior investigator at the Travel Industry Authority, Mark Cheng, said authorities would beef up their manpower to monitor famous tourist spots and border control points, as around 680 mainland tour groups are expected to visit Hong Kong during Golden Week.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police on Friday said they arrested 61 people, including five minors, in the past month for allegedly selling drugs online.

It said the suspects, aged between 14 and 59, are suspected of involvement in 43 cases.

Officers said they seized 128 kilogrammes of drugs, including cannabis buds, cocaine and magic mushrooms, as well as electronic cigarette pods.

The hauls were worth about HK$38 million in total, police said. 

Chief Inspector Charm Yiu-kwong said drug syndicates have created channels and groups on Telegram to sell cannabis products.

"Syndicates imported a large amount of cannabis oil from overseas countries to Hong Kong. They then processed the cannabis oil and mixed it into chocolates, candies and cookies, and sold them on social media platforms. In terms of appearance, they looked the same as normal products," he said.

Charm added that some electronic cigarette pods have been found to contain etomidate, warning that even a small amount of the controlled drug can cause death.]]>

Officers found 18 guns, 11 knives, and four daggers at a self-storage facility in Sha Tin, and arrested the 67-year-old suspect on Wednesday.

Speaking at a press briefing, Superintendent Cheung Ting-fung said the man had previously held licences for various types of guns, but these were revoked in 2008. 

Cheung also said it is suspected that all the firearms found at the storage facility this week were obtained illegally from overseas.

He added the case was not related to the social unrest in 2019.

"Currently, we do not have any evidence showing that the arrested person is connected to any previous riot or violent cases. We tend to believe that this arrested person is just a firearms fanatic."

The case will be heard at the Sha Tin Magistrates’ Courts on Friday afternoon.]]>

Speaking at the sixth plenary session of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Co-operation Conference, Lee said the two cities would sign 20 cooperation documents and reach consensus on 65 projects in areas such as innovation technology, industrial development, digital economy and finance.

"Since the first meeting in 2003, the two cities have been engaging in more frequent exchanges... Hong Kong has become one of the major export markets and also the largest source of foreign investment into Shanghai," he said.

Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng said these exchanges created opportunities and built a win-win situation for the two cities.

"We sincerely hope that the two cities can take the opportunity of signing a new round of cooperation documents to integrate our development strategies comprehensively, create highlights for our cooperation and together push Hong Kong-Shanghai cooperation to a new phase," he said.

Deputy director of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong Yin Zonghua, Shanghai Vice Mayor Hua Yuan, and Financial Secretary Paul Chan, were among the other leaders and officials at the meeting.]]>

    Trial and error needed for plastic alternatives: CEO

    <![CDATA[The CEO of one of the companies, invited by the government to meet the media and introduce their alternatives to plastic disposable tableware, says a period of trial and error is still needed. 

Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, George Chen of Ecoinno said not all plastics had the same attributes when it came to heat, strength and storage and it was the same for their environmentally-friendly alternatives. 

"This is a point I would like to share. We all know humans have been using plastics for the last 30 years, 40 years - we have all experience," he said. "Different plastics are made for different purposes. For example, a plastic container for sandwiches is not the same formulation as a plastic container for oil or soup."

Chen said that with the introduction of new plant-fibre containers and cutlery, consumers and users needed to focus on what alternative products met their needs rather than just focusing on price. 

On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Department put on the media event as it launched the Green Tableware Platform to help people and businesses find alternatives to plastic utensils. The online platform provides a list of suppliers for the environmentally-friendly products.

The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban began on Monday, and restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.

The second phase of the ban is expected to begin in 2025, when plastic containers will also be banned for takeaways.]]>

    <![CDATA[The SAR government late on Thursday condemned a vote by the European Parliament critical of Hong Kong’s national security legislation.

In a statement, the administration said it “strongly opposed the so-called resolution adopted by the European Parliament against Hong Kong, and strongly condemned the Parliament for making baseless allegations about Hong Kong and smearing the Hong Kong National Security Law (NSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance”.

A government spokesman said that the SAR had a constitutional duty to safeguard national security, adding that all sovereign states had an inherent right to safeguard their security in accordance with international law and the UN charter. He noted that many other countries had also enacted national security legislation.

“Turning a blind eye to the fact and making exaggerated remarks, the Parliament has demonstrated typical political hegemony and hypocrisy with double standards,” the spokesman added. 

The spokesman noted that both the NSL and the Ordinance clearly specify that rights and freedoms under the Basic Law and international covenants are to be protected.

“The European Parliament neglected the relevant provisions and lashed out wantonly, fully exposing its malicious intentions," the spokesman added.

“We must once again emphasise that the Ordinance is a piece of legislation to defend against external forces that endanger our national security, acting like a sturdier door and a more effective door lock to defend our home,” the spokesman said.

“The HKSAR Government strongly urges the European Parliament to stop smearing and interfering in Hong Kong affairs which are internal affairs of China and ensure that their remarks concerning the NSL and the Ordinance are fair and just, and stop making scaremongering remarks.”]]>

    <![CDATA[Transport unionists on Thursday spoke out against a decision by Citybus to import 20 drivers from the mainland, saying they are worried that more will come in the future and affect the jobs of local drivers.

Citybus said the first five of the 20 approved bus captains who arrive here next month will take a driving test before they’re allowed to start work, adding that they will only work on non-franchised routes, such as services for employees and tourists.

But the Motor Transport Workers General Union said it is worried that this is just the beginning, and that Citybus will bring in more non-local workers to operate on franchised routes down the line. 

Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Michael Luk, meanwhile, noted that the hourly salary of a mainland bus captain is slightly lower than that of a local, and expressed worries that local drivers may get a pay cut in future.

Leung Nuen-yui from the union's Citybus section said the company should offer better remuneration packages for local recruits before importing drivers.

"There are new recruits, but not many of them stay in the company. This shows that there are issues with the pay, welfare, shift arrangements, working location and hours. I hope the company will solve these problems before looking into other solutions," he said.

The group added that it is arranging a meeting with Citybus and the authorities, and it does not wish to resort to taking industrial action.

Citybus, for its part, said it prioritises local workers and offers a bonus exclusively to new local employees.

The Transport Department also said in response that it has taken into account the welfare of local drivers before allowing Citybus to import drivers. 

In a statement, it said the bus operator has proven that it was not able to hire suitable local drivers, adding that these imported drivers are not allowed to run franchised routes.]]>

    <![CDATA[Immigration officials on Thursday said they expect Lo Wu will be the busiest border crossing during the mainland's "Golden Week" holiday next week.

On Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee projected almost six million arrivals and departures for the week, with some 800,000 mainland tourists expected to come to Hong Kong. 

The Immigration Department said Labour Day on May 1 is tipped to be the busiest day, with arrivals and departures reaching one million at land checkpoints.

It said that between April 30 and May 5, an average of around 200,000 rail journeys a day are expected through Lo Wu, and 170,000 via Lok Ma Chau.

An average of 130,000 journeys a day are expected for the bridge to Zhuhai and Macau.

The Immigration Department's boundary division commander, Ng Hoi-ka, said travellers are advised to use the department's mobile app for real-time border traffic information, so they can see how busy the different checkpoints are.

She also called on travellers to avoid crossing the border during peak hours.

"If all travellers cross the border during the peak hours at the same time, there's bound to be some congestion and longer waiting times. So we urge everyone, if you can, please avoid the peak hours," she said at a press briefing.

"Generally speaking, for departures, it starts getting crowded from eight in the morning, and it'd be the busiest between 10 and 12 o'clock."

She added that her department has prepared for the busy week by curbing holidays for frontline officers.

A control centre will be set up along with other departments to monitor checkpoint operations, so officers can respond to any emergencies.]]>

    <![CDATA[Customs officials on Thursday said they arrested two former directors of an online household product store on suspicion of failing to supply pre-paid products to customers, a breach of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.

Officials said they had received 451 complaints against the company as of 8am on Thursday, and the complainants had made prepaid orders to the company, involving around HK$400,000 worth of household goods. 

However, the customers didn't receive the products - or refunds. 

The online shop shut down earlier this month. 

Customs officials said they arrested two men, aged 33 and 38, on Wednesday.

The pair were released on bail and officers did not rule out the possibility of making more arrests.]]>

    Non-plastic utensil firms show off their products

    <![CDATA[Companies supplying alternatives to plastic cutlery on Thursday demonstrated how their products fare, with one showing how to put its straw into a sealed drink and another attempting to cut a steak with its knife and fork. 

The Environmental Protection Department has launched an online platform to help people and businesses find suppliers.

The platform invited four suppliers to demonstrate their products to the press. One of them, Ecoinno, poured boiling water inside a container to prove it can tolerate high temperatures. 

Its CEO, George Chen, said business has gone up by 70 percent since the disposable utensil ban took effect on Monday. 

“So rules and regulations are extremely important, and we believe the windows are here. So it depends on when customers want to pick things up. It's no more to replace,” he said.

“The new product will allow [restaurants] to stay away from just price competition because [the non-plastic products] are sustainable.” 

Chen said his containers contain leak-proof materials and are 10 percent more expensive than other plastic alternatives on the market.

But he said despite this, many hotels, hospitals and schools have been placing orders because they like the high quality. 

“What are the values that they can get on it besides turnover? So this is what we are talking about. Can it, for example, be reheated? You see.. after [being heated] by 100 degrees water, it stays exactly the way that it is,” he said. 

Another supplier, Supply Ching Company, demonstrated how to scoop up a portion of sticky rice with its spoon. Its founder, Alvis Yip, said his company will advise restaurants how to pick between the two types of spoon it offers.   

“We have two kinds of spoon in the market now. We have the rice spoon and the soup spoon. The rice spoon is specially designed for rice because it has a straight lined design. So the [spoons] can go directly into the rice, but the soup spoon is actually designed for just holding the soup and the noodles. So to use it as a rice spoon, it will be a bit soft and weak,” he said.

“Usually when the restaurant approaches us, we will gather the information of what kind of product they sell. So we will suggest the suitable cutlery for them.” 

Another supplier demonstrated how its knife and fork can be used to cut steak. The fork snapped during two attempts. 

The supplier explained that the forks are designed with detachable handles, saying this makes them weaker and more prone to breakage once the handles have been detached multiple times.]]>
