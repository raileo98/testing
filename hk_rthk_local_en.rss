    <![CDATA[Heavy rain continued to fall over Hong Kong on Friday with the Observatory issuing the Amber Rainstorm Warning just after 8.30 am.

The amber signal means that heavy rain, exceeding 30 millimetres in an hour, has fallen and is likely to continue.

The Observatory warned of flooding in some low-lying and poorly-drained areas, while the Labour Department told construction workers and contractors to pay attention to electrical safety in the workplace.

The SAR has seen a number of amber warnings this week as a trough of low pressure persists over Guangdong.]]>

    Trial and error needed for plastic alternatives: CEO

    <![CDATA[The CEO of one of the companies, invited by the government to meet the media and introduce their alternatives to plastic disposable tableware, says a period of trial and error is still needed. 

Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, George Chen of Ecoinno said not all plastics had the same attributes when it came to heat, strength and storage and it was the same for their environmentally-friendly alternatives. 

"This is a point I would like to share. We all know humans have been using plastics for the last 30 years, 40 years - we have all experience," he said. "Different plastics are made for different purposes. For example, a plastic container for sandwiches is not the same formulation as a plastic container for oil or soup."

Chen said that with the introduction of new plant-fibre containers and cutlery, consumers and users needed to focus on what alternative products met their needs rather than just focusing on price. 

On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Department put on the media event as it launched the Green Tableware Platform to help people and businesses find alternatives to plastic utensils. The online platform provides a list of suppliers for the environmentally-friendly products.

The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban began on Monday, and restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.

The second phase of the ban is expected to begin in 2025, when plastic containers will also be banned for takeaways.]]>

    <![CDATA[The SAR government late on Thursday condemned a vote by the European Parliament critical of Hong Kong’s national security legislation.

In a statement, the administration said it “strongly opposed the so-called resolution adopted by the European Parliament against Hong Kong, and strongly condemned the Parliament for making baseless allegations about Hong Kong and smearing the Hong Kong National Security Law (NSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance”.

A government spokesman said that the SAR had a constitutional duty to safeguard national security, adding that all sovereign states had an inherent right to safeguard their security in accordance with international law and the UN charter. He noted that many other countries had also enacted national security legislation.

“Turning a blind eye to the fact and making exaggerated remarks, the Parliament has demonstrated typical political hegemony and hypocrisy with double standards,” the spokesman added. 

The spokesman noted that both the NSL and the Ordinance clearly specify that rights and freedoms under the Basic Law and international covenants are to be protected.

“The European Parliament neglected the relevant provisions and lashed out wantonly, fully exposing its malicious intentions," the spokesman added.

“We must once again emphasise that the Ordinance is a piece of legislation to defend against external forces that endanger our national security, acting like a sturdier door and a more effective door lock to defend our home,” the spokesman said.

“The HKSAR Government strongly urges the European Parliament to stop smearing and interfering in Hong Kong affairs which are internal affairs of China and ensure that their remarks concerning the NSL and the Ordinance are fair and just, and stop making scaremongering remarks.”]]>

    'Mainland Citybus drivers may affect locals' jobs'

    <![CDATA[Transport unionists on Thursday spoke out against a decision by Citybus to import 20 drivers from the mainland, saying they are worried that more will come in the future and affect the jobs of local drivers.

Citybus said the first five of the 20 approved bus captains who arrive here next month will take a driving test before they’re allowed to start work, adding that they will only work on non-franchised routes, such as services for employees and tourists.

But the Motor Transport Workers General Union said it is worried that this is just the beginning, and that Citybus will bring in more non-local workers to operate on franchised routes down the line. 

Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Michael Luk, meanwhile, noted that the hourly salary of a mainland bus captain is slightly lower than that of a local, and expressed worries that local drivers may get a pay cut in future.

Leung Nuen-yui from the union's Citybus section said the company should offer better remuneration packages for local recruits before importing drivers.

"There are new recruits, but not many of them stay in the company. This shows that there are issues with the pay, welfare, shift arrangements, working location and hours. I hope the company will solve these problems before looking into other solutions," he said.

The group added that it is arranging a meeting with Citybus and the authorities, and it does not wish to resort to taking industrial action.

Citybus, for its part, said it prioritises local workers and offers a bonus exclusively to new local employees.

The Transport Department also said in response that it has taken into account the welfare of local drivers before allowing Citybus to import drivers. 

In a statement, it said the bus operator has proven that it was not able to hire suitable local drivers, adding that these imported drivers are not allowed to run franchised routes.]]>

    'Lo Wu will be busy during Golden Week'

    <![CDATA[Immigration officials on Thursday said they expect Lo Wu will be the busiest border crossing during the mainland's "Golden Week" holiday next week.

On Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee projected almost six million arrivals and departures for the week, with some 800,000 mainland tourists expected to come to Hong Kong. 

The Immigration Department said Labour Day on May 1 is tipped to be the busiest day, with arrivals and departures reaching one million at land checkpoints.

It said that between April 30 and May 5, an average of around 200,000 rail journeys a day are expected through Lo Wu, and 170,000 via Lok Ma Chau.

An average of 130,000 journeys a day are expected for the bridge to Zhuhai and Macau.

The Immigration Department's boundary division commander, Ng Hoi-ka, said travellers are advised to use the department's mobile app for real-time border traffic information, so they can see how busy the different checkpoints are.

She also called on travellers to avoid crossing the border during peak hours.

"If all travellers cross the border during the peak hours at the same time, there's bound to be some congestion and longer waiting times. So we urge everyone, if you can, please avoid the peak hours," she said at a press briefing.

"Generally speaking, for departures, it starts getting crowded from eight in the morning, and it'd be the busiest between 10 and 12 o'clock."

She added that her department has prepared for the busy week by curbing holidays for frontline officers.

A control centre will be set up along with other departments to monitor checkpoint operations, so officers can respond to any emergencies.]]>

    <![CDATA[Customs officials on Thursday said they arrested two former directors of an online household product store on suspicion of failing to supply pre-paid products to customers, a breach of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.

Officials said they had received 451 complaints against the company as of 8am on Thursday, and the complainants had made prepaid orders to the company, involving around HK$400,000 worth of household goods. 

However, the customers didn't receive the products - or refunds. 

The online shop shut down earlier this month. 

Customs officials said they arrested two men, aged 33 and 38, on Wednesday.

The pair were released on bail and officers did not rule out the possibility of making more arrests.]]>

    <![CDATA[Companies supplying alternatives to plastic cutlery on Thursday demonstrated how their products fare, with one showing how to put its straw into a sealed drink and another attempting to cut a steak with its knife and fork. 

The Environmental Protection Department has launched an online platform to help people and businesses find suppliers.

The platform invited four suppliers to demonstrate their products to the press. One of them, Ecoinno, poured boiling water inside a container to prove it can tolerate high temperatures. 

Its CEO, George Chen, said business has gone up by 70 percent since the disposable utensil ban took effect on Monday. 

“So rules and regulations are extremely important, and we believe the windows are here. So it depends on when customers want to pick things up. It's no more to replace,” he said.

“The new product will allow [restaurants] to stay away from just price competition because [the non-plastic products] are sustainable.” 

Chen said his containers contain leak-proof materials and are 10 percent more expensive than other plastic alternatives on the market.

But he said despite this, many hotels, hospitals and schools have been placing orders because they like the high quality. 

“What are the values that they can get on it besides turnover? So this is what we are talking about. Can it, for example, be reheated? You see.. after [being heated] by 100 degrees water, it stays exactly the way that it is,” he said. 

Another supplier, Supply Ching Company, demonstrated how to scoop up a portion of sticky rice with its spoon. Its founder, Alvis Yip, said his company will advise restaurants how to pick between the two types of spoon it offers.   

“We have two kinds of spoon in the market now. We have the rice spoon and the soup spoon. The rice spoon is specially designed for rice because it has a straight lined design. So the [spoons] can go directly into the rice, but the soup spoon is actually designed for just holding the soup and the noodles. So to use it as a rice spoon, it will be a bit soft and weak,” he said.

“Usually when the restaurant approaches us, we will gather the information of what kind of product they sell. So we will suggest the suitable cutlery for them.” 

Another supplier demonstrated how its knife and fork can be used to cut steak. The fork snapped during two attempts. 

The supplier explained that the forks are designed with detachable handles, saying this makes them weaker and more prone to breakage once the handles have been detached multiple times.]]>

    'Anti-migrant sentiment pushes domestic workers away'

    <![CDATA[Migrant domestic worker activists have called for a stop to people who accuse workers of prematurely terminating their contracts to change employers, saying anti-migrant sentiment in Hong Kong would discourage them from staying in the city. 

Sringatin, who chairs the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union, on Thursday said foreign domestic workers preferred destinations other than the SAR because of better conditions. 

“Hong Kong is not the only place for domestic workers to find a job. There is also competition between Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, Malaysia and other countries... If Hong Kong continues [to have] more restrictions on domestic workers, I think many people will leave Hong Kong," she said. 

"Please stop [job-hopping] accusations, please stop doing anti-migrant policies, because it's not only stopping migrants from coming to Hong Kong, but it also makes the image of Hong Kong become very bad." 

Shiela Tebia, the chairperson of Gabriela Hong Kong, said foreign domestic workers had been singled out for changing employers.

"If [workers] are not content with their working conditions in the company, they can easily send a resignation letter and find another job that gives them a better working conditions," she said. 

"Why does it become an issue when domestic workers want to have a better working condition? Why is the migrant workers community criminalised because of wanting to change employers?"

Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun earlier said a revised code of practice for employment agencies, aimed at deterring foreign domestic workers from changing employers mid-contract, would be promulgated in the second quarter of the year. 

Under the planned changes, firms would be asked to explain clearly to helpers on requirements to change employers and employment agencies would be banned from providing monetary incentives for workers to quit early. 

Last year, the Immigration Department refused about 500 employment visa applications from foreign domestic workers for suspected job-hopping.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Environment and Ecology Bureau clarified that shops could still use plastic containers to pack takeaway food, after a supermarket chain was found using paper food boxes to pack sushi, much to the irritation of some customers.

A photo went viral online, showing Japanese discount retailer DON DON DONKI using non-plastic, non-transparent containers to pack sushi, with netizens describing that as "sushi in blind boxes".

Reaching out through its “Big Waster” social media account, the bureau said using plastic packaging was still ok for now. 

"This situation is the same with takeaways, so supermarkets can still use plastic boxes and lids to pack takeout sushi. Of course, they can also use transparent boxes, so customers can clearly distinguish the food quality and types," it wrote on social media.

The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) also reassured people that purchasing or using disposable plastics will not lead to any legal violations. 

In a statement, the EPD clarified that eating inside a food court in a shopping mall or a department store is considered as dine-in.

But it stressed that the plastic ban does not apply to pre-packaged food products displayed on shelves in food courts, because these products can be seen as takeaways.

The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban began on Monday, and restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.

The second phase of the ban is expected to begin in 2025, when plastic containers will also be banned for takeaways.

    <![CDATA[Police say the driver of a school bus died after he accidentally fell from the vehicle, which then rolled over him in Diamond Hill on Wednesday, while in a separate incident a driver was killed in Lau Fau Shan when his truck slid down a slope, trapping him.

Officers say the 47-year-old bus driver was preparing to leave the car park of a housing estate on Hammer Hill Road not long after 4pm when the accident happened. 

The man suffered multiple injuries but was conscious when he was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. He later lost consciousness  where he was declared dead just after 9.30pm.

At about 6.30pm, police were called to Lau Fau Shan to reports that a man was trapped between a medium-sized truck and some water tanks.

Officers say that initial investigations show that the man had parked the truck, which was linked to a container trailer and the water tanks, on a slope near Fung Kong Tsuen Road. After he got out, police believe the truck rolled backwards, leaving him trapped.

Firefighters were able to release the 67-year-old driver but he was declared dead at the scene.

Kowloon East police are looking into the Diamond Hill incident while officers in New Territories North are checking on the Lau Fau Shan case.]]>

    HK buyer snaps up 'lost' Klimt for US$32mn

    <![CDATA[Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of Miss Lieser", a painting of a young woman left unfinished when the Austrian artist died, was bought by a Hong Kong buyer at auction on Wednesday for 30 million euros (US$32 million) despite open questions about its subject and previous ownership.

The work was long thought to have been lost when in fact it was hanging in a private villa near Vienna for decades, according to the auction house Im Kinsky that put it on display in January before putting it under the hammer. Im Kinsky had estimated its value at 30 million to 50 million euros.

The auction house confirmed the buyer was in Hong Kong and was represented by Patti Wong & Associates, but did not identify the buyer. The AFP news agency said the painting was sold to the SAR's HomeArt gallery.

It shows its likely teenage subject in a turquoise dress draped in a flowing floral gown against a red background, her alabaster skin and piercing, pale brown eyes contrasting with her dark, curly hair.

Despite depicting her so clearly, it remains unclear who "Fraeulein Lieser" actually was. The brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were wealthy industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire, having built their wealth on jute and hemp, making twine and rope.

Henriette Amalie Lieser-Landau, nicknamed "Lilly", was married to Justus until their divorce in 1905 and became a well-known patron of the arts. It is possible she commissioned the painting of one of her daughters, or Adolf Lieser could have done so with his daughter Margarethe as the subject.

"According to the latest provenance research, Klimt's model was possibly not Margarethe Constance Lieser, Lilly Lieser's niece, but one of her two daughters (with Justus), either Helene, the older one, born in 1898, or her sister Annie, who was three years younger," the auction house said on its website.

What happened to the painting after Klimt's death in 1918, when it would have been in his studio, remains unclear, particularly what happened after Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938 and the country's Jews were persecuted, expropriated and sent to concentration camps.

"It was these many ambiguities and historical gaps that prompted the current owners to contact the legal successors of the Lieser family and to agree on a 'fair and just solution' with them all in 2023," Im Kinsky said, without identifying the current owners.

"It has been agreed not to disclose the contents of the said agreement; however, it can be stated that all conceivable claims of all parties involved will be settled and fulfilled through the auctioning of the artwork," it said. (Reuters/AFP)

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) said new ways to increase economic productivity could help retain the SAR's status as a supply chain hub. 

“New quality productive forces” — a concept introduced by President Xi Jinping and highlighted in Premier Li Qiang’s work report — refer to productivity increases helped by breakthroughs in technology, rather than in traditional industry.

Speaking at a media briefing on Tuesday, the council's executive director, Mohamed Butt, said new quality productive forces, also known as NPF, could help attract more businesses to the SAR. 

"This NPF can empower the growth of new industrialisation, as well as enhance our capability to become a stronger base for exports. I think in the budget speech, the Secretary for Finance mentioned that Hong Kong needs to become an international supply chain hub," he explained. 

"In conclusion, I think NPF can really bring in new people, new ideas, new businesses, and enhance our capability to become a stronger base for supply chain hub for the world."

The chairman of HKPC and lawmaker, Sunny Tan, said new quality productive forces could enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness.

"We are talking about being innovative, being able to apply new technologies in industrial development and the product development side with new products, new materials, new production processes, and also new ways of distribution," he said. 

"And then, productive forces, really, it's about getting all stages, doing it right with, again, innovation and technology to enhance our competitiveness along the entire supply chain."]]>

    <![CDATA[Edgar Cheung and Siobhan Haughey were named the "best of the best" at the Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards on Wednesday, both of them claiming the honour for the third time.

The nominated athletes swapped their tracksuits for dresses and suits to walk the red carpet at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai for the annual event dubbed the Oscars of the local sports industry. 

Swimmer Haughey was named the SAR's top female athlete, with some of her accomplishments including winning the city's first World Aquatics Championships medal by finishing second in the women's 100 metres freestyle final, and taking home two golds, one silver and three bronzes at the Asian Games. 

Ahead of this summer's Paris Olympics, where she's hoping to better her two silver medals from the Tokyo Games, she said this award gives her the motivation to work even harder.

"I'm very honoured to win this award especially since we have so many amazing athletes in Hong Kong, and I think it's a great motivation for me leading up to the Olympics, and also it's really nice that we have this awards ceremony because it kind of recognises all the athletes' hard work," she said.

"It's a nice occasion for all of us to dress up. It's nice seeing all the athletes not in their workout attire. It's a mini gathering before the Olympics. We get to celebrate all of our achievements from before, but then now we get to focus on what's really important which is the Olympics. We still have a few more months away, and I think we're all just trying to work hard, train hard and try to do our best at the Olympics."

Other winners in the women's category were table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem, karate athlete Grace Lau, fencer Vivian Kong and three-time world snooker champion Ng On-yee. 

Meanwhile, fencer Edgar Cheung won the best of the best on the men's side after snatching gold in the foil at both the World University Games and the Hangzhou Asian Games. 

Joining him on the stage in the men's category were rising golfer Taichi Kho, badminton player Chu Man-kai, table tennis ace Wong Chun-ting and emerging tennis star Coleman Wong. 

Cheung said he was especially thankful for his coach, team and family's support to get him to the Olympics once again.

"That means a lot to me because from what I see in the video just now, for the whole year, we fought to give our best to get a better result," the Tokyo gold medalist said. 

Three groups were given Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards in the Sports Combination category, covering small teams and duos. One of them was the men's foil team of Cheung, Ryan Choi, Leung Chin-yu and Yeung Chi-ka, who won bronze at the World Championships. 

Choi said they were happy to win the award, even though they did not qualify for the Olympics.

"We are very honoured. It's kind of like a comfort, so we hope we continue to do better, and maybe make another history [moment] in the next year and the coming years," he said. 

Other winners in the sports combination category were the badminton mixed double pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet. It's the fourth time the duo were honoured in the category, but it's the first time Tang has been able to make it to the ceremony. He said it was a memorable occasion. 

"It has been a hard but important year for us. Our results weren't ideal prior to Olympic qualifications. It was only from last May that our condition and results slowly got better," he said. 

"But now that we have a ticket to the Olympics, it is definitely great motivation. We need to thank everyone for their support in helping us get this award. Thank you."

The third winner of the sports combination award belongs to the men's rowing pair Lam San-tung and Wong Wai-chun. Wong said the award is a sign of their improvement in the past two years and an affirmation of their Asian Games gold medal.

He said, "Since I just announced that I am retiring, I would say this is the best reward for my retirement. I've been in competitive rowing for 10 years now. At the age of 24, I want to step outside my comfort zone, try new things, and find a different way to repay society."

The men's football team, who reached the semi-finals at the Asian Games and featured in the Asian Cup, claimed the team awards for the first time in eight years. 

Head coach Jorn Andersen said he hopes to see football continue to grow in the territory.

"I want to say that it is very important that we have so many young players who take the step. And many young players who take the achievement in the front, to improving in the front. And to be part of the Hong Kong team in the future, so we that maybe again we can make some good results," he said.]]>

    Audit Commission urges rehabus to scale up services

    <![CDATA[The Audit Commission on Wednesday called on a minibus operator catering for the disabled to beef up its services, saying it turned down requests for pre-booked trips even though vehicles were available.

In its report, the watchdog said the government-subsidised rehabus operator rejected 21,425 orders for door-to-door transportation in 2023, double the figure recorded in 2019.

But there were on average nine to 42 spare vehicles on a weekday from 2019 to last year, the body said.

The commission added that around one-fifth of the 121 fixed routes averaged six or even fewer passengers a month, while the waiting list for services had become longer, with someone on it for almost two years.

Routes running between hospitals, clinics and MTR stations operated by another company were also under-used, the watchdog said.

Among 12 hospital routes, three were transporting zero passengers 80 percent of the time in 2023.

The watchdog said the operators should review their routes and improve patronage.

It added the Transport Department should look at requests to purchase more rehabus vehicles carefully, noting the operators did not report on the utilisation of existing vehicles when asking the government for funding to buy new ones from 2021 to 2023.

124 vehicles costing HK$135 million in total were procured from 2018 to 2023.

The Commissioner for Transport, for her part, said she agreed with the audit recommendations.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Health Bureau said on Wednesday that officials plan to look into the feasibility of expanding a mental health support hotline to other platforms, such as instant messaging apps. 

The 18111 hotline which launched last December has been receiving around 350 calls per day. 

In a written reply to the legislature, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said those seeking help wanted to talk about issues such as mental distress, family relationships, physical health problems and work pressures. 

He said the hotline operators have referred around 200 people to different organisations for support, and two urgent cases to the police.

Lo said officials have been regularly reviewing the effectiveness of the service and it could be expanded.

"Taking into account the outcome of the review of the operation, we will consider the feasibility of extending the service to other platforms (such as instant messaging software) in consultation with the Advisory Committee on Mental Health in due course," he wrote.

The minister added that officials plan to ask an independent organisation to conduct a full service evaluation study in the third quarter of the year, to collect views from NGOs and other stakeholders through questionnaires and focus groups.]]>

    Unionists issue 'Labour Day Declaration'

    <![CDATA[Unionists on Wednesday called on the government to improve labour protection, boost benefits for public servants and increase the city's minimum wage. 

Nine labour and civil service unions issued a "Labour Day Declaration" ahead of May 1, with 10 policy suggestions, including an end to further labour imports and improving occupational safety. 

The chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council, Lee Kwok-keung, said the city’s minimum hourly wage should be increased by HK$15. 

“While our proposed increase from HK$40 an hour to HK$55 seems substantial, we should bear in mind the fact that a basic lunch can easily cost HK$55. If the minimum wage doesn't even cover the cost of a meal, it's not really reasonable,” he said. 

Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, meanwhile, noted a recent 0.1 percentage point increase in Hong Kong's unemployment rate, meaning an extra 9,400 people – 111,700 in total – were out of work. 

Lam, who is also the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, urged the government to provide a job-matching service for businesses participating in labour importation schemes, with the aim of getting them to prioritise local people. 

Meanwhile, the chairman of the Federation of HKSAR Civil Servants, Lee Fong-chung, said there is a need for the government to come up with policies to address staff shortages.

Lee said the annual retirement rate for senior government positions has hit 10 percent and there has been a "huge" number of resignations in recent years.

“We think it's very important for the government to refill the vacancies as soon as possible, through regular recruitment or transferring some contract [workers] onto permanent terms,” he said.

Lee said the number of government workers in their 20s and 30s resigning has been particularly high and more family-friendly policies are needed to keep hold of them. 

“Like [increasing] maternity leave… And also, the government may amend some policy on the long-term investment for the civil servants, like they can use a portion of their pension fund for them to buy a house or to buy medical insurance,” he said. 

The chairman of the Government Employees Association, Cheung Hoi-wing, added that many civil servants have chosen to retire in mainland cities in recent years and the government should extend civil servant healthcare benefits to cover the whole Greater Bay Area.]]>

    <![CDATA[The city will soon learn the results of a national astronaut selection drive, which includes two positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau.

Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of China Manned Space Agency, said on Wednesday the selection of payload specialists in the two SARs has been "essentially completed".

“With the central government's approval, we selected payload experts in Hong Kong and Macau for the first time in the fourth batch of preparatory astronauts selected, and relevant information will be officially released soon,” Lin said.

“As for the specific selection results for Hong Kong and Macau, we will inform the SAR governments at the earliest opportunity.”

The new batch will work with other active astronauts to carry out the follow-up space station missions and achieve China's landing on the moon.

Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said earlier several Hongkongers have made it to the final round of selection to join the nation’s space programme. 

They were among more than 100 people who signed up for the recruitment drive after the agency announced in 2022 that it was recruiting 12 to 14 reserve astronauts for space missions, with two payload specialist positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau for the first time.

Lin’s remarks came as the China Manned Space Agency announced the launch of the Shenzhou-18 spacecraft on Thursday evening.]]>

    Officials advised to learn lessons from toilet saga

    <![CDATA[Officials tasked with revitalising countryside areas are being urged to learn lessons over a HK$13 million "smart toilet" which turned out to be anything but.

Users of the toilet in the New Territories village of Lai Chi Wo were promised a hands-free experience, with the amenity boasting automatic sliding doors that opened and closed with just a wave.

After almost two years of construction, the toilet was completed in the summer of 2023 and was trumpeted as a showpiece facility that could boost the image of countryside washrooms.

But it all went down the pan not long after it opened. 

"On 9 December 2023, a user was locked up inside the new public toilet as the automatic sliding door could not be opened by waving hands over the control panel or pressing the emergency button," the Audit Commission noted in a report on Wednesday. 

It was later discovered that special panels installed on the roof of the toilet, which were meant to purify air as well as generate electricity, were not producing enough power.

The auditor said the automatic door system was subsequently disabled and the sliding doors converted to manual operation "to restore the public’s confidence over the usage of the toilet".

It noted that as well as supposedly being "smart", the toilet was also originally estimated to have been almost HK$5 million cheaper than it was.

The Audit Commission said the Countryside Conservation Office responsible for the project should draw on the experience it gained with the toilet when it embarks on other minor improvement works in the future.]]>
