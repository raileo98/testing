    Tang Kwai-sze died of misadventure, jury rules

    <![CDATA[A liver disease patient who passed away a few months after two transplants died of misadventure, a jury at the Coroner's Court ruled on Tuesday.

The five-person jury returned the majority verdict following a 13-day inquest into the death of Tang Kwai-sze, with experts divided on what caused her liver failure.

Tang, a hepatitis B carrier, had two liver transplants in April 2017 after suffering from acute liver failure. She died in August that year at the age of 44.

The two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.

Delivering its verdict, the jury said Tang suffered from hepatitis B flare-up because of her taking high-dose steroids without being prescribed antiviral medication at the same time.

In guiding the jury to make its recommendations, coroner Monica Chow said jurors needed to consider whether new measures by the Hospital Authority (HA), including a guideline on antiviral prescription for hepatitis B carriers using immunosuppressive therapy, were enough to protect patients.

The jury made five recommendations to the HA, including requiring doctors to prescribe antiviral drugs for patients on high-dose steroids for even less than seven days, subsidising hepatitis B carriers to do regular check-ups at private hospitals, educating them about precautions and symptoms, making sure doctors' clinical records were clear, and providing a reason when laboratories cancelled a test.

Wrapping up the hearing, the coroner told Tang's eldest daughter Michelle Wu that while her love for her mum would not fade with time, she hoped Wu could "one day fill the void left by her mother in a positive way".

The coroner noted that Wu had volunteered to donate her liver to her mother and that showed how brave she was. 

"All mothers in the world will tell you that [Tang] would feel comforted and proud to have such a brave, selfless, and loving daughter like you," Chow said.

    Police aim to replace DVDs with digital image storage

    <![CDATA[Security chief Chris Tang on Tuesday said the police want to build a digital platform to store images and videos with evidential or intelligence value, instead of using DVDs.

The official told a Legco security panel meeting that it would be more efficient and less labour-intensive to upload materials to an e-platform than to store them on DVDs.

Lawmakers, including Chow Man-kong from the election committee, said it is time to go digital.

"A friend of mine wanted to give the police a USB memory stick that contains dash camera footage to lodge a complaint on traffic matters, but they couldn't do that and were asked to submit a DVD. They were shocked," he said.

The official said the system will cost HK$359 million - down from the HK$390 million previously estimated - and should be available in 2026, if Legco approves the funding.

Tang said the platform would not be equipped with artificial intelligence or facial recognition capabilities, but those could be added later.

"We agree that incorporating AI programmes to our Centralised Digital Image Platform will help us investigate cases. We will deal with it at the next stage," he said.

"We just need the money, the technology is already here and it can be added [to our platform] easily. I believe it's something that has to be done in future."

The police also want to develop a new personnel information system, which will cost HK$142 million.

The legislature's finance committee will scrutinise the two funding requests.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police on Tuesday arrested five men over an alleged armed robbery attempt at a jewellery store in Tsim Sha Tsui. 

At around noon, five people entered the store at the intersection of Hankow Road and Haiphong Road carrying knives and hammers, officers said.

Police said they had been tipped-off about a planned robbery and were waiting nearby. 

"During the operation to make the arrests, officers had drawn their guns as a warning because the robbers were holding knives and hammers. After the warning, we still used our bare hands to control them," said Superintendent Gar Kam-lam.

"One of those arrested suffered a minor injury on his face," Gar added.]]>

    Career expo to attract mainland and foreign talent

    <![CDATA[As the city held a summit on global talent, the Hong Kong Talent Engage began a two-day career expo on Tuesday, attracting professionals from the mainland and foreign countries. 

A job seeker from Brazil said he had worked in two mainland cities, Shanghai and Hangzhou, for five years and had just come to Hong Kong through the Top Talent Pass Scheme. 

He said the talent scheme makes it easier for people like him to work in the SAR.

"With this visa, I have this opportunity to come, and there's no limitations on what kinds of companies I can work for... This city is very business friendly. People have an entrepreneurial mind," he told RTHK. 

The Top Talent Pass Scheme is one of several talent-admission schemes introduced by the SAR government, and even people who have not secured a job offer in Hong Kong can apply for it.

Another job seeker from Sichuan Province said she wanted to find a job in Hong Kong because of the labour market situation on the mainland.

"I could hardly get a [response from mainland companies]. I think I can find more opportunities here. I think I can improve my skills and have a better lifestyle here," she said.

A recruitment agency said support for workers was very important in order to retain them in a long run.

"I believe a lot of talent from outside of Hong Kong have got all skill sets that we lack or we're short of," said Eric Ng, chief strategy officer at the agency.

"I think all the corporations need to get ready so that they not only can attract them to come, but can retain the talent."

The Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, Professor David Cardwell, echoed Labour Secretary Chris Sun's views that a focus should be on attracting talent from Southeast Asia.

"Some of the best talent, academic talent, are in Southeast Asia. The world just needs to adapt to that, to celebrate those talents, but Southeast Asia needs to make it easy for the world to do that as well," he said.

The CareerConnect Expo runs from Tuesday to Wednesday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.]]>

    'Improved dental registration to avoid queuing pain'

    <![CDATA[Preliminary registration for dental appointments at government clinics will start four hours earlier than usual from July to prevent patients from queuing overnight and making multiple trips, according to officials, after the city's auditor called on authorities to review the arrangements.

The Audit Commission earlier observed some patients queuing up for hours at clinics just to try to get an appointment for the following day before registration starts at 12am. 

Under current arrangements, patients who have pre-registered to see the dentist must return to the clinic in person in the morning to pick up a disc for their appointment. 

At Legco's public accounts committee, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said registration would instead begin at 8pm for the following day's slots starting from July. 

"After [preliminary] registration, patients only need to report to the clinic half an hour before the appointed time and have their identity cards checked, and then they can receive service. The improved arrangement can avoid the pain of queueing overnight and making multiple journeys to the clinics," he told lawmakers.

From Thursday, registration and disc distribution at a Sai Kung government dental clinic would begin at 1pm instead of 11am, so that patients can immediately receive services that begin at 1:30pm. 

He also said an electronic system for appointment registration at dental clinics was in the pipeline. 

"Patients no longer have to physically get a disc. The online platform will provide information of the number of remaining quota discs of the 11 clinics. We have started the work of developing the system, which will be launched shortly," Lo said. 

Officials attributed a shortage of dental staff to difficulties in increasing the annual quota of appointment slots, with Director of Health Ronald Lam pointing to a shortfall of 108 practitioners, which accounted for 30 percent of the total manpower. 

Lam said authorities decided to allocate to more resources to serving the underprivileged by raising the number of slots from 20,000 to 60,000 next year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Tuesday said the government's efforts to attract talent to the city will focus on professionals from Southeast Asia and Europe. 

Sun’s remark came after the government approved 180,000 talent importation scheme applications, with 120,000 people having already arrived in the SAR.

Speaking to reporters at the Global Talent Summit, Sun said most of the applicants were from the mainland.

But the labour minister said the government is committed to welcoming talent from all over the world, with a focus on Southeast Asia and Europe.

"We are very sure once we have let them know all the growth prospects, all the very exciting opportunities here in Hong Kong, a lot of the talents in Southeast Asia as well as in Europe, they will be thinking about Hong Kong and they will really give Hong Kong a good shot," he said.

Sun said the government expects around 7,000 people to attend the two-day summit at the Convention and Exhibition Centre.]]>

    <![CDATA[Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Wang Xiaoping on Tuesday said the central government fully supports Hong Kong in attracting international entrepreneurs and talent to develop their ambitions in the SAR, as well as the integration of the Greater Bay Area into global innovation networks.

Speaking at the Global Talent Summit in Wan Chai, Wang said the nation has the largest talent resources pool in the world, with over 80 million technical professionals and over 200 million skilled workers.

The number of people who have received higher education exceeds 240 million, while China is ranked first in the world for the number of research and development personnel and patent applications, the minister added.

Wang said these things provide a solid foundation for the nation to support Hong Kong in building a “new highland” of international talent.

“The central government attaches great importance to Hong Kong's role in building human resources, and fully supports Hong Kong in conducting wider and closer exchanges and cooperation with other parts of the world to attract aspiring entrepreneurs to Hong Kong to develop their ambitions”, said Wang.

“We support building a high-level talent base in the Greater Bay Area, attracting global high-level innovation talent, businesses, as well as research institutions to the Greater Bay Area, as well as promoting the region to be integrated into the global innovation networks,” she added.

Pointing to China’s transition towards high-quality development, the minister also said the nation will concentrate on industrial modernisation and cultivate more high-quality, innovative professionals to develop “new quality productive forces”.

The nation will also push forward creating mechanisms and platforms to introduce global talent into the Greater Bay Area, which will provide new impetus for Hong Kong’s prosperity and integration into national development, she said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that Hong Kong is the place to be for global talent, in part because the SAR has long been one of Asia's most liveable cities. 

Speaking at a government-organised summit on talent, the CE said Hong Kong is the only city where "the global and China advantages" come together. 

He added that other institutional strengths include prime business prospects because of the One Country, Two Systems principle, a low tax system as well as the free flow of information, capital, goods and people. 

Lee said language is never a problem because English and Chinese are both official languages in the SAR, and Hong Kong will get even more multilingual as it thrives as a cultural hub where East meets West.

He noted that 40 percent of the territory is earmarked as country parks with a UNESCO geopark, endless hiking trails and stunning beaches.

"In Hong Kong, you don't just get world-class work opportunities, you get a satisfying life, too," Lee said in an opening speech at the summit.

"Yes, choosing to relocate to Hong Kong on your own or with your loved ones is a big decision. But I'm here to tell you, that this is the place where you can work hard, play hard and enjoy hard."

Lee said the central government's recent move to relax visa rules for Shanghai and Beijing businesspeople to come to Hong Kong will promote professional exchanges and reinforce the SAR's role as the country's international talent hub.

The CE also thanked senior officials from Beijing, particularly Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Wang Xiaoping, as well as those from Guangdong and Macau, for attending the summit and sharing their ideas.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police have arrested three people over the alleged abduction of a woman in Tsim Sha Tsui on Monday. 

Officers were notified at around noon that two masked men dressed in black had attacked a woman and bundled her into a vehicle at the junction of Ichang Street and Hankow Road.

The woman, 47, was later found unharmed in a different vehicle near Heng On Estate in Ma On Shan.

Inspector Chan Kwan-to on Tuesday said officers arrested two men and a woman on suspicion of various offences, including unlawful detention and driving without a licence. 

Chan said officers believe the alleged kidnappers and victim already knew each other and that they were involved in a financial dispute.

It's thought the woman was first taken to a flat in Tsing Yi and was released following discussions over a HK$100,000 debt, the inspector said.

    <![CDATA[More mainland tourists came to Hong Kong during the Golden Week holiday compared to the previous year, the government revealed on Monday, saying the number of inbound arrivals from across the border met expectations. 

The administration said the city saw about 766,000 mainland visitor arrivals over the five-day break ending on Sunday. 

On average, Hong Kong recorded some 153,000 inbound trips from the mainland each day, about 22 percent more than last year's Golden Week holiday. 

"Although the Golden Week was affected by the rain most of the time, the number of mainland visitors reached around 760,000, matching our initial estimate and bringing Hong Kong's economy with more than HK$2 billion consumption returns," said Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung. 

About 570 tour groups from the mainland came to Hong Kong during the five-day period, while May 2 recorded the highest number of inbound arrivals with 192,000 people arriving in the territory. 

Officials earlier estimated about 800,000 mainland visitor arrivals for the holiday period.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Fire Services Department (FSD) on Monday said the personal information of thousands of people, including its staff and individuals who filed tree collapse reports during a super typhoon, could have been leaked after the right to access the data was altered without permission. 

But it reassured the public there was no evidence that any such data had actually been released. 

The department said it discovered personal data potentially being exposed on one of its IT systems last Friday, which involved the surnames and telephone numbers of some 480 people who had reported tree collapses when Super Typhoon Saola hit Hong Kong in September last year. 

About 5,000 fire services staff were also affected and had their names, phone numbers, ranks and numbers, and postings subject to the potential leak, with some even having their incomplete identity card numbers possibly exposed. 

"The FSD believes that the incident happened when the outsourced contractor handled the data migration procedure. During the process, the access right of the data was found altered without authorisation, posing a potential risk of data leakage," a spokesperson said. 

The department has demanded the outsourced contractor to immediately suspend the system and all of its contract jobs, while withdrawing its access right to the system to prevent data being exposed. 

It also apologised and notified those affected through text messages or phone calls. 

The latest incident came after a string of data breaches at major public bodies, such as the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and the Companies Registry, with a lawmaker calling for the heads of government departments responsible for such leaks to be held accountable for the blunders.]]>

    <![CDATA[A Tamar Park exhibition featuring hundreds of luminous ovoids will be extended by six days until June 8, officials said on Monday.

Apo Wu, who heads the Art Promotion Office, said some 900,000 people have already been to see the "teamLab: Continuous" exhibition since it opened as part of "Art@Harbour 2024" on March 25.  

"It surpassed our expectation. We do hope that more people can visit the exhibition and take advantage of the opportunity, which is why we extended the period by almost a week. We hope to see more visitors in the remaining time," she said.

Wu said the free exhibition has been a hit with mainland tourists. 

"There are a lot of similar exhibitions in the mainland, but they require an admission fee. So I think this exhibition has an attractiveness to people from the mainland. The weather during the Labour Day Golden Week was really bad with heavy rain, but we still saw some people go during light rainy periods," she said.

"It is an outdoor exhibition after all so the weather does affect the viewing experience. So we hope for the remaining viewing period, the weather will be nice, so that more people, despite the ending of the holiday period, can come back to Hong Kong to experience [the exhibition]."  

Wu added that a requirement for visitors to make bookings for part of the exhibition area will be scrapped from May 8.]]>

    <![CDATA[Jurors looking into the death of a liver disease patient, who died a few months after two transplants, were told on Monday to consider ruling that she died of misadventure or natural causes, or, less preferably, give an open verdict.

Tang Kwai-sze, a hepatitis B carrier, had two liver transplants in April 2017 after suffering from acute liver failure. But her condition worsened and she died in August that year at the age of 44.

After hearing from more than a dozen doctors who testified at court, coroner Monica Chow gave guidance to the jury on the 12th and final day of the inquest.

The coroner said if members of the jury, based on all the evidence heard in court, believed her liver failed because of a steroid or a kind of anti-cholesterol medication, then they should rule that she died of misadventure.

But, she said, if they think Tang actually suffered from auto-immune hepatitis and that was what triggered her liver failure, then they should rule that she died of natural causes.

The coroner said in case they cannot determine what caused her liver failure, the jury can give an open verdict, but there should be enough evidence to decide what happened.

The jury will retire to consider its verdict on Tuesday.]]>

    Punish officials over govt data leaks: lawmaker

    <![CDATA[The heads of government departments responsible for data leaks should be held accountable and punished for the blunders, DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said on Monday. 
 
On Friday, the Companies Registry said data on some 110,000 people had been exposed due to a fault in its digital platform, just a day after the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department said a password problem put data on 17,000 public housing tenants at risk.

Quat, who chairs Legco's Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting, said personal data leaks by government departments and public bodies are completely unacceptable.

She added that the heads of departments should bear responsibility for safeguarding sensitive data, rather than relying on the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO), which serves as the government's main IT support office. 

"The head of the department should be responsible for all the cyber security issues of their own department, computer system and networking. We suggest the government to make sure that all the government heads, department heads and also the IT project heads are responsible for all the cyber security issues," she said.

Francis Fong, honorary president of the Information Technology Federation, said he was surprised by the apparent failure of the Companies Registry to conduct a security check on a new system prior to its launch. 

"It is actually a design fault on a new system implemented. So I was surprised why they had not done any security check before the system was implemented and launched," Fong said.

"Similar mistakes have happened again and again in different IT departments. So if all these IT departments can get guidelines from the OGCIO, I hope we can solve this problem once and for all."

Fong also called on government departments to enhance collaboration in safeguarding data security.]]>

    <![CDATA[A University of Hong Kong (HKU) nursing student has been cleared of groping a first-year pupil during an orientation camp last year. 

The Fanling Magistrates' Courts on Monday acquitted Tang Ho-yin, 20, of indecent assault and common assault, two charges he previously pleaded not guilty to. 

The court had heard that Tang indecently assaulted a woman in an activity room at Po Leung Kuk Jockey Club Tai Tong Holiday Camp on August 20, 2023, and groped her again in a dormitory living room the next day. 

Handing down the verdict, magistrate Frances Leung said the witness of the first alleged incident, during a game at the orientation camp, failed to identify the facial features of the perpetrator. 

The court was not reassured that the defendant was the perpetrator, Leung added. 

On the common assault charge against Tang, the judge said the court accepted that the defendant's hand had moved up and down the alleged victim's arm while discussing sexual content. 

But Leung also noted the alleged victim had voluntarily extended her arm out to demonstrate an element of the discussion.]]>

    'Rainstorm warnings can't be district-specific'

    <![CDATA[A spokesman for the Hong Kong Meteorological Society, Leung Wing-mo, said on Monday that it would not be possible to tailor rainstorm warnings for particular districts, because rain is extremely unpredictable. 

On Saturday, the Red Rainstorm Warning was in place for nearly seven hours and flooding and landslides were reported in Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O. 

The observatory had at one point raised the possibility of a Black Rainstorm Warning and some people questioned why the alert wasn't issued, even though rain was particularly heavy where they were.

Leung, a former assistant director at the observatory, said rainstorm warnings are generally issued when rainfall at a certain amount of monitoring stations around the city meet the relevant criteria.

He noted that on Saturday, government forecasters provided supplementary information regarding the amount of rain recorded in different places.

"Really, the downpours are part of nature, they may happen wherever. So forecasting where exactly the rain will be is very difficult," he said on an RTHK programme.

"We can only issue warnings based on rainfall for the whole of Hong Kong, that the amount recorded or the expected amount, triggers the corresponding rainstorm warning."

Leung described the heavy rain on Saturday as rare, although he noted that April is regarded as belonging to the "flooding season" in South China.

He said the climate has changed because of global warming and people can expect more extreme weather conditions and heavier rain from now on.

Meanwhile, Sai Kung district councillor Christine Fong said hundreds of vehicles were trapped by floods on Saturday after the heavy rain caught drivers by surprise.

She suggested officials build stormwater storage facilities or an artificial lake in Hebe Haven and Ho Chung.]]>

    'Time for sectors to work on boosting tourist numbers'

    <![CDATA[The Tourism Board's executive director on Monday said various sectors should reflect on how to attract more tourists, as consumption patterns have changed since the pandemic.

In an interview with the Hong Kong Economic Journal, Dane Cheng said he was satisfied that Hong Kong saw about 11 million visitor arrivals in the first quarter of the year, and he expects the number to rise in the second half.

Cheng said Hong Kong has been doing a lot in terms of promotion and holding mega events, and it's time for different sectors to reflect on how to attract more tourists.

"The problem now is, tourist numbers recovered back to 70 percent [of pre-Covid numbers], but the departure number for local people is over 100 percent... No matter whether it's the catering sector or the retail sector, if your business can't retain the locals, how can you expect it to attract tourists?" he questioned.

Cheng added that people should stop comparing current tourist numbers with those before the pandemic.

"It's unrealistic for tourist numbers to return to the levels of 2018 and 2019... Back then, when so many people were coming to Hong Kong, no matter which area was that, Hong Kong people were overloaded. Tourists also want a good experience, instead of staying in a crowded place," he said.

Meanwhile, chairwoman of the Travel Industry Council Gianna Hsu said there were about 760,000 mainland tourist arrivals during Golden Week.

Speaking after attending a radio programme, Hsu said the rainy weather did not affect the mood of tourists, and some businesses even benefited from the poor conditions.

"There was rain occasionally, urging some tourists to visit shopping malls. Therefore, I believe the retail sales for shopping malls had seen improvements. We expect Golden Week will bring about HK$2 billion consumption revenue to Hong Kong. We look forward to the next Golden Week holiday," she said.]]>

    'Shortened nursing programme won't affect teaching'

    <![CDATA[The Hospital Authority has announced plans to shorten the duration of its nursing programme starting from the new academic year in September, allowing students to complete the entire course in 3.5 years instead of the current four years. 

The HA launched the Professional Diploma in Nursing three years ago, offering classes in its three nursing schools at Caritas Medical Centre, Tuen Mun and Queen Elizabeth hospitals. 

Upon graduation, students can choose to become registered general nurses and pursue a bachelor’s degree in other institutions.

Bonnie Au, principal at Queen Elizabeth Hospital’s nursing school, explained the decision to shorten the duration of the programme was made “in view of the arrangement of placement and learning for the students”.

“Actually there is no change in the contents we teach to the students, like the theories and the skills, there is no change, just the period has been shortened,” she said.  

She said students will still be entitled to at least 1,400 hours of internship in public hospitals and their learning outcome won't be affected. 

From their very first placement, students will assist registered nurses to carry out various tasks, including measuring blood pressure, feeding dependent patients and distributing medications, Au said. 

When asked about the high attrition rate among nurses in recent years, with over 1,800 full-time nurses at public hospitals having left their positions last year, Au stressed the three nursing schools had already reached their maximum capacity with 300 places offered each year. 

She said a lot would need to be considered if authorities wanted to increase quotas at the schools, including finding extra teaching space and staff, as well as liaising with the Nursing Council of Hong Kong. 

The tuition fee for the 3.5-year programme is HK$132,700. Applications close on July 19.]]>
