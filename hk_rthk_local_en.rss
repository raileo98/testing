    <![CDATA[The Legislative Council on Wednesday passed an amendment bill to the city’s wildlife protection law, raising the maximum penalty for illegally feeding wild animals to HK$100,000 and a one-year jail term.

The Wild Animals Protection (Amendment) Bill also includes a new fixed penalty for illegal animal feeding, at HK$5,000.

And the ban on illegal feeding would be expanded to cover feral pigeons.

Currently, the maximum penalty for illegally feeding wild animals is a fine of HK$10,000.

The amendments, which will take effect from August 1, are aimed at boosting deterrence against illegal feeding activities in the SAR, protecting wild animals and improving environmental hygiene.

"Under the bill, the scope of government enforcement officers has expanded,” Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan told lawmakers.

“Together with various enforcement departments, a guideline has been put in place, and there will also be comprehensive training to cover identification of wild animals and process, as well as the standards of evidence collection.”

Tse added that joint departmental operations will be arranged if necessary to ensure the effectiveness and consistency of law enforcement, and authorities will continue installing CCTV cameras at “black spots”.]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan began a 10-day trip to France and the US on Wednesday, in a joint business trip with delegates from Macau and the Guangdong provincial government.

During their stay in the French capital of Paris, they will attend the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and Europe (France) Economic and Trade Cooperation Conference, to promote business opportunities in the bay area, as well as Hong Kong’s role as a “super connector” and “super value-adder”.

The finance minister will also meet the local political and business communities to explore opportunities for greater collaboration between Hong Kong and France.

The group will then fly to California and visit San Francisco and Berkeley, where they will attend a Bay-to-Bay Dialogue, as well as a high-level event on the climate, next week.

Separately, Chan will attend a business luncheon organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in California’s bay area, to attract US firms to Hong Kong, especially those in the innovation and technology sectors.

Among those joining the trip are the SAR’s commerce minister Algernon Yau, transport chief Lam Sai-hung, Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan, and the Greater Bay Area development commissioner Maisie Chan.

Chan will return to the city on June 1.

Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong will be Acting Financial Secretary during Chan’s absence.]]>

    <![CDATA[Thousands of paddlers are to make a splash in Victoria Harbour during next month’s Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races, with the event expected to draw crowds of spectators.

The races, jointly organised by the Tourism Board and the Hong Kong China Dragon Boat Association, will be held on June 15 and 16. 

More than 4,000 athletes from a dozen countries and regions, including China, Thailand and Singapore, will take part. Teams from the Hong Kong and Macau SARs will also compete.

Participants this year will also have a chance to join special races commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. 

The tourism body will also host a drone show for the Tuen Ng Festival and a pyrotechnic display on the first evening of the races. 

“The whole event, we believe, would help to enable our Hong Kong community, our residents, as well as our tourists [to have a] tremendous, happy and interesting experience,” said the board’s executive director Dane Cheng. 

“We expect it would draw around 130,000 visitors and patrons to this event, and together, we would be hoping that everyone would enjoy and have a good time.”

Cheng said the festivities, including the races and other shows, carry a price tag of HK$17 million.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police said they arrested 100 people who were allegedly involved in cases of fraud and money laundering.

The suspects, aged between 17 and 75, were involved in 82 cases related to investments, online employment and online romance scams.

Officers said the cases involved a total of HK$180 million.

Chief inspector Cheng Ki-fung said the suspects were mostly stooge account holders of syndicates, who were responsible for collecting or managing the money.

He said one of the cases involved 54 victims who had bought coupons online.

"The suspects employed many different defrauding tricks. Different kinds of coupons appeared in different cases. They also sold different coupons during different festivals," Cheng said.]]>

    Worldcoin ordered to get its eyes off Hongkongers

    <![CDATA[Cryptocurrency project Worldcoin has been ordered to cease operations in Hong Kong after breaching privacy rules through its iris scans and collection of face images, authorities said on Wednesday.

The Office of the Privacy Commissioner launched a probe into Worldcoin after raiding six of its premises around Hong Kong in January.

The project, founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, provides a digital passport with free Worldcoin cryptocurrency tokens, but participants first have to have their faces and eyeballs scanned to verify they are human and unique.

More than 8,300 people in Hong Kong signed up, but many didn't know what they were agreeing to and the data taken from them was unnecessary and excessive, said Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) Ada Chung.

Worldcoin was found to have breached several parts of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, including by failing to explain to participants the risks regarding disclosure of their biometric data and by planning to keep personal information for up to 10 years in order to use it to train artificial intelligence models. 

The privacy commissioner said another breach was that Worldcoin did not provide information to participants in Chinese. 

"The PCPD was of the view that participants using Chinese as native language would not be able to clearly understand the relevant policies and practices, terms and conditions of the Worldcoin project, and hence there was a lack of transparency."

The privacy watchdog said members of the public should contact it immediately if they find that Worldcoin is continuing to carry out iris-scanning in the territory.]]>

    <![CDATA[The chairman of the MTR Corporation on Wednesday said the railway giant had been successful in its recent property sales with the market picking up, adding the Tung Chung East project would be tendered again, after the rail firm failed to receive any bids last year.

Rex Auyeung and Jacob Kam, the firm’s CEO, were speaking to reporters ahead of the company's annual general meeting.

"The Tung Chung East Station development project will be tendered again in the next 12 months. As for the Siu Ho Wan Depot Site project, we are carrying out preliminary work and we will announce tender details when we are ready," said Auyeung.

Meanwhile, Kam said last year's station flooding was due to the impact of flash flooding, not maintenance problems, adding the recently installed flood sensors at 26 stations would now allow for a prompt response by staff. 

He said the railway operator had put measures in place for dealing with the upcoming typhoon season to ensure the safety of its staff and passengers.

"During typhoon [signal] No. 9 or above, all train services on the open sections will be suspended. Now, if there are still trains out there running on the open sections during the transition from typhoon 8 to typhoon 9 or above, we will of course try to continue those services already on the open sections to the original destination, or at least to the nearest stations with enough space to let the passengers off the trains so that they can stay in a safe place until the weather improves," he said. 

"To do that, we have actually in place our train crew, our maintenance staff, and our station staff to be prepared for that."

As for plans by Shenzhen authorities to redevelop the control point at Lo Wu to allow for smoother connectivity between the two locations, Kam said the two sides were still discussing the details and the MTR would cooperate when a decision had been made.]]>

    <![CDATA[Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk on Wednesday said the government expects to submit an amendment bill to Legco in July to raise the penalties for people who violate fire safety regulations.

Five people were killed in a fire at New Lucky House in Jordan in April, sparking concerns about inadequate safety facilities in old buildings.

At a Legco meeting, Cheuk said the authorities propose raising the maximum penalty by four times to HK$100,000 for those who fail to follow a fire safety direction, and to HK$200,000 for those who ignore compliance orders.

Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said financial penalties alone would be ineffective.

"You need to imprison people to serve a deterrent effect because Hong Kong people don't care about fines, but they certainly don't want to be jailed," he said.

Cheuk said the authorities were looking into including more provisions, including jail terms.

"If someone tries to obstruct the owner's corporation to carry out repair works, is uncooperative or tries to obstruct certain work intentionally, we're considering whether to impose penalties including imprisonment," he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said the government would not comment on the death of a British man accused by the UK of spying for Hong Kong, while another official said the city’s overseas trade offices would continue their work to promote the SAR and facilitate trade and investment.

They were speaking to reporters following a Legco antechamber meeting, after Matthew Trickett was found dead in a park west of London.

Trickett, who was 37, was one of three people arrested earlier this month and charged by UK authorities for allegedly helping to collect intelligence for Hong Kong. Bill Yuen, the office manager of Hong Kong's Economic and Trade Office (ETO) in London, is a co-defendant in the national security case.

Acting Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Bernard Chan declined to address questions on whether the ETO in London was monitoring the activities of HongKongers in the UK, saying officials would not address online rumours or baseless accusations.

Chan stressed that the trade offices would continue to carry out their lawful duties undeterred.
 
“The ETO’s task is to liaise with the local government, think tanks, different sectors and all walks of life to try to improve or facilitate or foster the cooperation on trade and investment, and also in the area of art and culture. We will continue to liaise with the local government to tell the good stories of Hong Kong,” he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[The city's head judge on Wednesday said corruption erodes public faith in governments and the rule of law and discourages people from making investments. 

Delivering a keynote speech at an anti-corruption symposium, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung said corruption was "the misuse of power" that led to "some not being subject or held accountable under the same rules", placing them above the law. 

"Corruption erodes public faith in governments and institutions, where the rule of law is built on public trust," he said. 

"Even the appearance of corruption, never mind corruption on a micro scale, will lead to the erosion of the public's belief in the rule of law. Therefore, if for no other reasons than the upholding of the rule of law in a society, it is vital that corruption be subject to continuing vigilance and efforts to combat it at all levels and in all forms."

He also argued against claims there were potentially economic benefits to corruption, calling such views "exceedingly short-term and narrow".

"Corruption is not merely the product of a bad institution, it actually helps create bad institutions," he said.

"Investors are likely to be discouraged by corruption from making investments, as they would prefer fair, transparent and competitive markets in order to protect their capital."]]>

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong is at the forefront of the international fight against corruption, Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday, while vowing to sustain the territory's "pioneering role" in anti-graft work. 

He also told the opening ceremony of a symposium in Wan Chai that the SAR has a clean and efficient government and zero tolerance for corruption. 

The three-day event, co-hosted by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities, attracted more than 500 participants, including anti-corruption experts, legal professionals and academics. 

"Under the unique 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, Hong Kong maintains a robust regulatory regime in line with international standards, and is renowned globally for its clean and efficient government, level-playing field for doing business, sound rule of law, a judiciary with independent judicial power, and zero tolerance for corruption," Lee said. 

He also said the anti-corruption body had championed the fight against corruption in the city for half a century. 

"It is a priority of the Hong Kong SAR government to sustain our pioneering role in combating corruption. We are pleased and proud to back the ICAC in widening its international network and cooperating with overseas counterparts," Lee said. 

"We are committed, as well, to ensuring that our legal framework and anti-corruption institutions, as well as public and private sector governance, reflect the highest international obligations and standards."

Danny Woo, the commissioner of the anti-graft body, told the same event that the Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption had organised 70 training courses for more than 40 agencies around the world since it was established in February. 

He said there would be a training programme on the use of innovation and technology to combat and prevent corruption following the symposium. 

"A unique feature of this training programme is a three-day study tour to the city of Changsha of China. Participants will witness first-hand China's latest development and anti-corruption initiative during the trip," Woo said. 

Also at the symposium was the signing of memoranda of understanding between the ICAC and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, as well as anti-corruption authorities from Kazakhstan, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa.]]>

    <![CDATA[British police are investigating the unexplained death of a man, who was charged earlier this month for allegedly helping Hong Kong authorities gather intelligence in the United Kingdom.

Matthew Trickett was due to appear in court on Friday to face charges under Britain's National Security Act.

British police said Trickett, who was 37, was found dead in a park in Maidenhead, west of London, on Sunday afternoon after a report from a member of the public.

Police said an investigation was ongoing into the death and an autopsy would be conducted.

Trickett’s lawyer said he was "shocked" by the news and was supporting Trickett's family.

The suspect was a former Royal Marine who'd worked for the UK border force. He was also the director of a security consultancy.

In early May, Trickett was arrested along with Peter Wai and Bill Yuen, the office manager of Hong Kong's Trade Office in London. 

The three men were granted bail and were due to appear in court on Friday. 

When they were charged, the Chinese Embassy in the UK said it made serious representations to UK officials over the matter, saying it firmly rejected and strongly condemned "Britain's fabrication of the so-called case".

The SAR Government, meanwhile, said it had "demanded the UK Government provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter. (Agencies)]]>

    <![CDATA[The Education Bureau has proposed that students taking the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education economics exam can skip part of the test from 2028.

It came after the bureau announced that students would be allowed to only take the compulsory test for the Chinese history DSE exam from 2026.

In a circular published on Monday, the bureau said the requirement for students to choose one of the elective tests would be removed for the economics DSE exam, and that students only sitting the compulsory paper would be rewarded a score of level 5 at most.

The bureau said this would allow students to focus on studying for the compulsory part of the exam to enhance learning effectiveness.

It said the measure would be implemented at secondary 4 starting from the 2025-26 school year, and would apply to the 2028 DSE exams.]]>

    <![CDATA[The University of Hong Kong's business school on Tuesday said it was investigating "a small number of cases" in which people submitted forged documents to gain admission to the school.
  
It said it had found that some agencies, which claimed to offer "guaranteed admission", had forged application documents. 

The school said it would not tolerate any acts of dishonesty or academic misconduct. 

"We are committed to academic integrity and to creating a fair learning environment," the school said in a statement. 

"While we understand that securing a place in a top graduate programme is not easy, it is regrettable that this competition has attracted individuals who resort to deceitful means in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage."

The school said that if any of the cases were confirmed to be true, it would take the necessary disciplinary and legal action, including withdrawing offers of admission and referring the cases to the relevant authorities. 

One HKU student told RTHK she was surprised that some people could cheat their way into the university.  

"It's shocking to me...it's quite unfair to other students who have worked very hard to get into the school, while others can just fake it," she said. 
 
Another student said the university should ensure fairness in admission. 

"For future students who want to go to the university...the school needs to have a stricter process for checking their certificates," she said.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Observatory issued its Red Rainstorm Warning Signal at 2.50pm on Tuesday, after the amber signal had been in force for almost five hours.

The observatory said heavy rain was continuing to affect the city, and a band of thundery showers over the southern part of the territory was edging closer. 

It said the downpours were particularly heavy on Lantau, where there could be serious flooding.

The observatory said more than 90 millimetres of hourly rainfall was recorded around noon in Cheung Sha on Lantau.

The Education Bureau said the city's schools should ensure that conditions were safe before allowing students to leave for the day.]]>

    <![CDATA[Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong on Tuesday said the government is considering turning the film set of local movie "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In" into a tourist site.

Speaking at a press briefing on Hong Kong's mega events, Wong said the movie set, which resembles the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City, has been well maintained.

"With regards to the set used in the movie 'Walled In', discussions are taking place. The set has been dismantled, but it's still there. They've been keeping it in rather good condition," he said.

"Discussions are ongoing as to whether they can let us have some parts of the set and it will be put up for display at a suitable location in Hong Kong."

Wong said Hong Kong will host 106 mega events in the latter half of this year, a couple less than the 108 organised in the first six months.

But he said the events still to come are expected to attract more visitors compared to those already held.

"The number of events taking place in the first half of this year is actually more or less similar to the number of events taking place in the second half. But in terms of scale, we noted that some of the events in the second half actually have a much larger capacity in terms of attracting visitors," he said.

"We believe that the number of visitors coming to Hong Kong for those mega events will actually be bigger than those in the first half."]]>

    <![CDATA[Salary increases this year are slightly lower than last year, according to a new report by Jobsdb. 

The employment platform polled nearly 3,400 workers between February and  March, and found that their average pay rise in 2024 was 3.2 percent. That's almost one percentage point lower than last year.

Employees in analytics had the biggest increase at 7.2 percent, followed by legal and compliance, and engineering at about five percent.

Workers in the design, retail sales and manufacturing sectors were at the bottom end with increments of less than one percent. 

The managing director of Jobsdb by SEEK in Hong Kong, Bill Lee, said the lower pay rise should not be a concern. 

“It is roughly within the range of salary increases in Hong Kong in the last ten years, and this number is also above inflation, which was roughly around two percent in March,” he said. 

Lee noted that industries like hospitality and tourism had benefited from the rebounded in visitor numbers, and their staff had a better than average salary rise.

“We do see a significant improvement in the salary and benefits package within the hospitality and tourism job functions. Firstly, within this segment, there's an average increase of 4.2 percent," he said. 

“And over 80 percent of those surveyed within this segment actually received salary increments, so that's a pretty positive outlook.” 

Lee said that jobseekers, particularly those under 25, had shown more interest in working on the mainland which has become the second most popular destination after Australia for Hongkongers seeking work outside the city.

“The policies implemented by the Hong Kong government to encourage more integration with the Greater Bay Area are probably showing some results, increasing the awareness of young people looking to work in the GBA,” he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday said the government will soon release the results of a scheme aimed at promoting the commercialisation of scientific research results and matching university projects with reliable investors.

At the Greater Bay Area Science Forum - Hong Kong Forum at the University of Hong Kong, Chan said the authorities have been rolling out various measures to promote the commercialisation of scientific research results.

One of the measures, he said, is the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme (RAISe+) that was launched last October and is aimed at promoting collaboration between the government, universities, as well as the technology and research industries.

"I am very pleased to report to you that the results of the first round of evaluation results of the scheme will be published within this month, and we will fund over 20 projects covering various fields, including health and medical sciences, new materials, new energy, and artificial intelligence robots et cetera,” Chan told the participants.

He added that authorities will also conduct more collaboration with cities in the Greater Bay Area, especially the manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, to create a vigorous technology and innovation ecosystem, while matching global capital with scientific institutions and universities.

Separately, Chan said the government will prepare and establish a third InnoHK research and development cluster in the second half of this year, to ramp up the SAR's tech transition.

The new cluster will focus on advanced manufacturing, materials, energy, and sustainable development, while the existing clusters focus on healthcare-related technologies, artificial intelligence, and robotics.

“Hong Kong, as an international financial centre, could play a positive role in guiding funds by being a ‘super connector’. The innovation and technology industries as well as the finance industry in the Greater Bay Area can support each other, and they are equivalent to combining the competitive strengths of the San Francisco Bay Area and the New York Bay Area,” Chan said.

The finance chief added that over 50 key enterprises, many in the innovation and tech fields, have been attracted to the SAR since late 2022, and it's estimated they will bring in investments worth more than HK$40 billion and create 13,000 jobs in the coming few years. 

Some 120,000 individuals have recently arrived in the SAR via the government’s various talent import schemes, with 20 percent of them working in the innovation and technology industries, Chan said.]]>
