    <![CDATA[A workers' rights group on Tuesday said it is angry about the manhole incident in which two workers died, noting that a similar accident happened at the same site before.

The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said a pair of workers had died in 2006 after working in a manhole on Yuen Wo Road in Sha Tin.

The Construction Industry Employees General Union also said authorities failed to learn lessons from the previous accident, and called on them to review regulations and enforcement practices to get rid of any loopholes.

The association said the Labour Department should ask construction companies to notify authorities before starting work in a manhole so inspections can take place.

The body said the Drainage Services Department needs to ensure that contractors fully comply with safety standards by conducting risk assessments, installing ventilators and monitoring equipment in the manholes, as well as arranging safety harnesses for workers.

It said it is trying to get in touch with the families of the workers to offer assistance.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police say they are looking into a video showing a man jumping from platform to platform at an MTR station. 

Footage circulating online appears to have been taken by the man himself as he leapt over the train track at Fo Tan Station on Saturday night.

The MTR Corporation called in the police on Monday night after reviewing its CCTV footage.

The company said the two platforms involved are more than two metres apart.

Police said the man carrying out the stunt appears to be between 20 and 30 years old, while CCTV suggests another man of around the same age also filmed what happened.

Officers said the case has been classified as a breach of MTR by-laws. No arrests have been made.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed his condolences to the families of two workers who died in a manhole in Sha Tin. 

Initial investigations showed the pair inhaled hydrogen sulfide and fainted while working in the manhole. They were later certified dead at the hospital.

Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said relevant departments were looking into the accident.

"I know that the Drainage Services Department has started reviewing the safety of similar works, and related works have been suspended," he said.

"We hope the Labour Department can conduct a detailed investigation as soon as possible to look into the cause of the accident. We will wait for the result of the investigation before we take follow up actions."

He added that various stakeholders had the responsibility to prevent industrial accidents from happening.

Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said the investigation would focus on the workers’ decision to enter the manhole.

"Workers should not be asked to enter manholes when they clean the drainage. They just have to spray water with high-pressure from above ground," she said during a Legco panel meeting.

"So why did the workers enter the manhole, leading to fatalities? That is one of the directions of the investigation."

A code of practice for safety and health at work in confined spaces was first introduced in 2000, and the government earlier said it planned to revise the code of practice in the first half of the year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that the authorities are ready for an influx of visitors during the mainland's Golden Week holiday next month, with preparations in place at immigration control points. 

Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, Lee said almost six million people are expected to enter or leave Hong Kong via the airport, rail and land crossings in the first week of May. 

He said special arrangements have been put in place for particularly busy periods.

"The Transport Department has already been in close contact with the transportation operators, so we'll be in full gear to ensure that there will be a good and smooth service for visitors," he said. 

"We'll also be turning out officers to take care of the management of tourist groups because we want to spread them out, also to stagger the meal arrangement, so that they will be smoothly absorbed into the whole arrangement at different districts."

Lee added that Golden Week will be a good opportunity to show people that Hong Kong is a vibrant city.

"We want the experiences of the visitors, that of course includes tourists and also maybe a result of the activities of local spenders, to have a good experience, both in taking meals, in shopping, in all kinds of services, businesses," he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the initial response to a ban on plastic tableware has been positive, adding the government would monitor the supply and price of alternative products.

Speaking a day after the first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics took effect, Lee said it takes time for people's behaviour to change. 

"We are aware that these alternatives cost about several cents or 20 cents or so. So they are affordable. I do believe that they will not be too costly in the operation of businesses," he told reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting. 

"There is an international trend to move away from plastic. Alternative products have been developed over quite some time. We have just started the regulation of plastic tableware. We do hope that Hong Kong people will understand that it is our responsibility to protect the environment." 

The CE added the Environmental Protection Department had provided a list of around 700 suitable non-plastic alternatives for businesses. 

The first phase of the ban prohibits the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.]]>

    <![CDATA[An investigation has been launched after two sewer maintenance workers died in a manhole in Sha Tin late on Monday.

Authorities say early indications are that the pair, and two other men who also fell ill while working in the manhole, inhaled hydrogen sulfide.

The Drainage Services Department said the men were employed by a contractor to clean sewers using high-pressure water jets, but their work should not have required them to enter the manhole.

Firefighters were called at around midnight to reports that the workers had fallen ill while operating three to four metres underground at the Yuen Wo Playground. 

The two men are said to be 26 and 34 years old. They were declared dead at the Prince of Wales Hospital. The two other workers were also treated at the same hospital.

The department said it had ordered a halt to work at the site and paused all similar work elsewhere until it could conduct safety checks. 

It’s also launched an investigation and promised to work with the Labour Department and the police, who are also looking into the case. It's been classified as an industrial accident.]]>

    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong is on track to becoming one of the first jurisdictions to adopt sustainability disclosure requirements in line with global standards, as the government vowed to do more to support green energy transition in the region.

Speaking at a forum to mark Earth Day, the finance chief said the government is committed to launching a roadmap this year to align local sustainability disclosure requirements with the International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards.

He also pointed out that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will soon release a local green classification framework that aligns with rules adopted by the European Union and the mainland to combat so-called “green washing”, the act of providing misleading information about products’ environmental benefits.

Separately, Chan noted the SAR could do more to support green transition finance in the region, which would involve investing in green sectors and projects, as well as assisting carbon-intensive industries in their net-zero transformation.

“We have the expertise, infrastructure, and regulatory framework that support international investors and different transition projects,” he said.

“There’s clear room to explore how Hong Kong could better help channel capital to support the transition of high-emitting sectors and heavy polluting industries in the region,” he added.]]>

    <![CDATA[An advisory council on Monday conditionally approved the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the San Tin Technopole project, despite heavy criticism.

Green groups had last week called the report the worst wetland assessment since EIA regulations came into place in 1998.

The Advisory Council on the Environment approved the EIA at a meeting, but it listed eight conditions, including the submission of a habitat creation and management plan (HCMP) to the Environmental Protection Department nine months before pond filling works begin.

Other conditions included setting up wildlife corridors with a diameter of at least ten metres wide, submitting a plan on enhancing wetlands in Mai Po, and setting up an environmental committee to monitor the implementation of ecological mitigation measures.

Terence Tsang, the department's assistant director, said authorities will ensure the eight conditions will be met throughout the development of the tech hub.

"There is a very stringent mechanism to review that submission. Also, if in case the effectiveness of the measures recommended in the HCMP was found to not achieve the expected results... there is some kind of monitoring mechanism," he told reporters.

Green groups said the EIA had missed two species of breeding birds and also did not share the actual number of black-faced spoonbills counted in the survey.

Additionally, they said that the assessment had violated at least 35 statutory requirements and omitted crucial data points.

They also said the report should be resubmitted, as the area for the San Tin Technopole project had been expanded.

But council chairman John Chai said that that would not be necessary as the assessment already covered issues like ecology, fishponds and wetlands.

"Despite that there is a difference in the area, the coverage of the development, the environmental issues that need to be studied have not changed... So in other words, it's the same kind of study," Chai said.   	 

Responding to the development, environmental groups said they were highly disappointed by the decision, stressing that the San Tin Technopole project will cause irreversible damage to wetlands.

In a statement, they said the conditions laid out by the department did not specifically address the deficiencies in the San Tin EIA report, which they regarded as "invalid, incomplete, unscientific, and unreliable". 

Construction work for the tech hub will begin late this year.

    'Common sense for hep B patients to get antivirals'

    <![CDATA[It is “widely known medical knowledge” that hepatitis B patients taking steroids should also be prescribed antivirals, a renal specialist told the Coroner’s Court. 

Lui Sing-leung, who chairs the Hospital Authority’s central renal committee, also said a doctor who treated liver disease patient Tang Kwai-sze should have detailed the discussions on the use of steroids during a consultation session in his medical notes.

Tang had been taking steroids to treat her chronic kidney disease before she underwent two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017. She died in August that year at the age of 44.

The two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for allegedly failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.

Giving evidence on Monday, Lui said while the Hospital Authority had yet to issue a guideline on antiviral prescription for non-cancer patients at the time of Tang’s steroid treatment, it was “widely known” that such drugs should be given to the patient. 

He also told the inquest, before Coroner Monica Chow and a five-person jury, that Lam’s notes only said the patient was briefed on the “pros and cons of steroids” and agreed to using the drug. 

“Lam should have written down clearly the pros and cons of steroids that he had highlighted, because [relapse] is an important, serious potential complication,” Lui said.

Lui added that doctors who see the same patient subsequently might only rely on the previous medical notes, but not the hospital’s clinical management system.

Chan, the other doctor who later saw Tang, did not follow up with the patient as to why antivirals had not been prescribed when he should have, the court heard. 

Another expert witness, Professor Grace Wong from the Chinese University’s medical school, agreed that a hepatitis B flare-up, in which the level of liver enzymes rises abruptly, is mainly caused by the absence of antivirals during a high-dose steroid treatment.

Wong, a specialist in gastroenterology and hepatology, said a study she’s part of found that even short courses of a large dosage of steroids could increase the risk of a hepatitis flare-up, and such patients should receive antivirals regardless of the duration of the treatment.

She also said while it should be “common sense” to prescribe antivirals along with steroids, the practice was not written “in black and white” before the patient’s case came to light, so one could not expect all doctors to follow as such. 

The inquest hearing continues.]]>

    Plastic ban gets support but 'more can be done'

    <![CDATA[People were generally supportive of the plastic cutlery ban that took effect on Monday, but some said it was inconvenient and restaurants could do more to protect the environment.

Restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils like straws and cutlery, but plastic containers and cups are still allowed for takeaways.

Lamini, an office worker in Wan Chai, said cutting down on plastic products is the right thing to do.

“By removing plastic one by one, I think it can only be positive for our children and future generations. I agree to pay maybe a little bit more to have something made from paper and I think we have to do it now,” he told RTHK.

Nevaeh, a student enjoying a drink at a cafe in Admiralty, said she did not mind using a paper straw, even though it became soft after a while.

“I got used to it because they only provide paper straws, so you’ll just accept it,” she said.

But Luk, a worker, said paper straws just do not work and restaurants should switch to reusable ones, like stainless steel straws, for dine-in customers.

“They should have thought it through and tested the straw first,” he said.

“I could barely drink from the paper straw. I had to take it out and drink from the glass, because it was flattened.”

Michael, the director of a steakhouse in Wan Chai, said he understands that eco-friendly cutlery may not be as useful as plastic cutlery and so he is offering his customers different options when ordering takeaway food.

"If they want plastic tableware it’ll cost them HK$5. Of course people will prefer to dine in if they’re having steak. If they order takeaways they can ask us to slice the steaks for them,” he said.

Meanwhile, the owner of a Vietnamese noodle joint said it will switch to paper pulp cutlery in a week or so, when the stock of plastic tableware is used up.

But she said eco-friendly alternatives are more costly and will make it harder for small businesses to stay afloat.

“It costs around 30 percent more. But the economy is in a tough shape, how can we transfer the cost onto the customers? They may not come if we put up the price,” she said.

“We chose sturdier paper tableware because we serve soup noodles... and they’re more expensive.”]]>

    New growth charts introduced after 31 years

    <![CDATA[Health authorities on Monday said they are updating how they measure children's growth for the first time since 1993 to reflect the fact that today's young people are typically taller and heavier. 

New charts are being rolled out to help check how a child's weight, height, body mass index and head circumference compare with those of their peers. 

Dr Thomas Chung, from the Department of Health, worked with colleagues from Chinese University and the University of Hong Kong. He said there was a clear trend upwards in the height and weight of children and adolescents in the territory.

"When we compare the new charts, HK2020, with that of the old charts, HK1993, the median height of boys and girls at age 18, they are two centimetres taller than those in the median height of the same age in 1993," he said.

"There may be many factors like nutrition, and improvements in society, so this is expected and seen in other places in the world as well."

Chung also said they compared their current data to data routinely collected by the health department to validate and discover trends, adding the pandemic did not affect their results. 

"We collected more than 21,000 data from children and adolescents to construct the new Hong Kong 2020 growth references. These growth charts contain nine centile lines, as compared to the seven centile lines in the old charts," he said.

"The two additional extreme lines help frontline professionals have a more accurate and detailed assessment on the growth of the children, so that they can be referred to other specialists if necessary."

Dr Tony Nelson, a paediatrics specialist from Chinese University, said it was important to check local data instead of relying on global studies.

"In terms of our local data showing that infants are lighter at birth and girls are slightly shorter, I think this just reflects the importance of local data," he said. 

"So our local data shows that for the Hong Kong population, it's not like the WHO study, which was from six countries globally and included countries like the Netherlands, and India, and America, and other places. So I think this just reflects the local genetics, the local population here."

The Department of Health will start using the new growth charts in maternal and child health centres in July, and in student health service centres in September. 

The Hospital Authority will implement them in phases starting in September, and aims to have them in all its facilities by the end of the year.]]>

    <![CDATA[A catering sector leader on Monday said about 70 percent of Hong Kong's 18,000 restaurants are still handing out plastic cutlery, despite the first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics coming into effect. 

The government says it won't issue fines for breaches of the ban over the next six months. 

The president of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, Simon Wong, said many small and medium-sized restaurants are still using plastic, because it's cheaper than alternatives. 

Wong told an RTHK programme that he hopes people will get into the habit of taking their own cutlery with them when they go out for food, so they don't have to pay extra for eco-friendly options.

"The cost may be passed on to some people, because they may have to pay additional fees. However, I hope that people can, in the future, get into the habit of using their own tableware. It would be best if they can bring their own cutlery, as that way neither party needs to consider the matter of cost," he said.

The ban also means hotels can no longer provide guests with free plastic items, including disposable razors, toothbrushes and shower caps.

On RTHK's Backchat programme, the executive director of the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners, Caspar Tsui, said the industry is struggling to find alternative products.

"There has been a little difficulty in changing some of the products. Not because we were not willing to do it, but mainly because, you know, it's difficult to find sufficient suppliers and the quality of products that we need to maintain the service," he said. 

"We're adjusting slowly, not because we don't want to, but it takes time."]]>

    <![CDATA[The 9th Hong Kong Games began on Sunday with an opening ceremony held at the Coliseum. 

Cheerleading, a wushu performance and skateboarding were just some of the spectacles kicking off the biennial sports competition.

Athletes from the territory's 18 districts entered the venue before table tennis players Minnie Soo and Ding Ning, wushu athlete Samuel Hui and badminton player Wang Yilyu took part in a torch relay, lighting the cauldron together to signify the beginning of the games.

Under Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Raistlin Lau gave the opening speech. He said President Xi Jinping has emphasised the importance of sports for improving people's health and realising the Chinese dream.

"The biennial Hong Kong Games is a major sports event for all Hong Kong citizens. This is not only a good opportunity for Hong Kong athletes to show their strength, but also an excellent platform to promote 'Sports for All'," Lau said.

"This year, the Hong Kong Games has entered its ninth session. I know that in the next two months, there will be more than 4,600 athletes competing in eight events and a total of more than 1,000 games."

The inter-district sports event runs until June 9, with competitions in athletics, badminton, 3-on-3 basketball, futsal, swimming, table tennis, tennis and volleyball.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Sunday explained its decision not to hold a march on May 1, saying members don't want one and it has come up with "more effective" channels for workers to express their opinions. 

The group hasn't held its customary Labour Day march since before the Covid pandemic. 

"The some 400,000 members and 200 unions gathered on the platform of the FTU to promote labour values and the labour spirit. We are holding a series of activities in the upcoming week simply because that's what workers want. Not holding a march doesn't mean we are avoiding anything," said FTU president and lawmaker Stanley Ng. 

"We think those activities are more effective channels to let workers express their opinions," he told reporters at a press conference.  

FTU chairman and lawmaker Kingsley Wong said as part of its Labour Day campaign, the group has invited senior government officials, including Chief Executive John Lee, Chief Secretary Eric Chan and Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, to meet frontline workers from various industries to learn about their needs. 

He added that the group will also submit proposals on labour matters to the government next week.]]>

    <![CDATA[Two men have been arrested after several renovation and engineering companies were scammed out of a total of HK$1.5 million, police said on Sunday.

Officers said the companies were given work on what were purported to be school projects and were persuaded to use particular suppliers for materials. 

The firms were tricked into believing they had received deposits for the work, via forged screenshots of remittance records or cheques that bounced, before they made payments to the "suppliers".

"Once the victims made payments to those fake suppliers, they would lose all communication to the [fraudsters] and suppliers. Then the companies eventually realised they had been scammed,” said Chief Inspector Tam Tsz-wai.  

Officers said they arrested two men, aged 33 and 44, in Yuen Long on Friday, on suspicion of obtaining property by deception. 

Tam urged companies to check with their banks that their account balances increase following payments from clients, to ensure that the transactions have not been manipulated.]]>

    <![CDATA[Magic mushrooms, marijuana candy and LSD stamps were among a haul of drugs worth around HK$12 million seized in Yau Tong last week, police said on Sunday.

Officers said they raided a factory building in the area on April 19 and another the following day, after discovering that the sites were being used for manufacturing and trafficking dangerous drugs destined to be sold in Hong Kong. 

A 25-year-old man was arrested. 

"During the operation, our officers seized drugs with a total market value of more than 12 million dollars, including 12.5 kilogrammes of heroin, 8 kilogrammes of marijuana flowers, 270 sticks of marijuana vape juice, 500 millilitres of marijuana oil, marijuana candy and cookies, magic mushrooms and LSD stamps," said Senior Inspector Matthew Fung.

"Our officers also examined tools found in one of the units suspected to be used for manufacturing and packaging the drugs. We believe that this operation has successfully cut off the supply chain of this drug trafficking group."

Fung said officers were trying to trace the source of the raw materials used to produce the drugs found.]]>

    <![CDATA[Trees came down in several parts of the city, some rail services were disrupted and the observatory reported a waterspout on Sunday, as strong winds and thunderstorms battered Hong Kong.

The Peak Tram stopped running after a tree came down on Barker Road, while another fell on Wylie Road in Ho Ma Tin, temporarily blocking traffic. 

There was disruption to East Rail Line services for around an hour in the afternoon, with emergency maintenance work taking place at University Station after the wind apparently ripped away part of the canopy above one of the platforms. 

Officials said some high-speed train services between Hong Kong and the mainland would be delayed due to the bad weather conditions. 

Meanwhile, speed limits on the bridge to Macau and Zhuhai were reduced due to the high winds, the Transport Department said.

The Amber Rainstorm Warning was issued at 10am and while it was cancelled at 1.45pm, a thunderstorm warning remained in place.  

The observatory said intense gusts reaching 80 kilometres per hour or above could continue to affect the territory, as it also warned of possible flooding from rivers. 

At around 9.30 in the morning, a waterspout was spotted in Clear Water Bay, the observatory said.

It added that more thundery showers are forecast throughout the rest of the week. 

Meanwhile, authorities in Guangdong warned of the risk of floods from rivers, waterways and reservoirs after days of torrential rain. 

Officials in localities and municipalities across the province were told to begin emergency planning to avert any disasters.

    <![CDATA[Financial secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said new measures announced by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to cooperate with Hong Kong's capital market demonstrate the central government's support for the SAR.

Writing on his blog, Chan said the commission will support leading mainland companies in listing in Hong Kong, by stepping up communication and coordination among government departments.

The official said he learnt during a trip to Hangzhou and Suzhou last week that many companies have applied to list in Hong Kong, or are considering doing so.

He said the companies like Hong Kong for its institutional advantages, including intellectual property protection and internationalisation, as well as the synergy with other Greater Bay Area cities.

"They hope to use Hong Kong as their preferred springboard and platform to enter the international market, including establishing treasury centres and even international headquarters in Hong Kong," Chan said.

The finance chief said having more companies with great potential listed on Hong Kong's bourse will attract more international capital and solidify the SAR's status as an international financial hub.

Chan said that some technology firms from Hangzhou are also setting up research centres in the SAR as the two cities are about to establish a platform for technological collaboration.]]>

    <![CDATA[Environment and Ecology Secretary Tse Chin-wan says businesses do not have to worry too much about a ban on plastic tableware that takes effect from Monday, as it's not the government's goal to "punish" them with the policy.

Writing on his blog, the official said vendors can use up their plastic products during a six-month grace period so they will not be wasted.

Tse added that even when the grace period ends, authorities will educate vendors first in case of violation, instead of taking enforcement action immediately.

"We understand that a process of changing customs is needed, and it will take time for businesses to adjust the way they operate to comply with the ban. So, we will try our best to provide appropriate assistance when implementing the policy," Tse wrote.

The official said the catering, retail and hotel sectors all support the measure that will see restaurants banned from selling and using polystyrene tableware and plastic cutlery, while hotels will no longer be allowed to provide free plastic products like toothbrushes.

Tse said many hotels have switched to wooden toothbrushes and combs, while some eateries have bought non-plastic cutlery.

He called on restaurants to choose suitable eco-tableware, noting that there have been concerns that paper pulp cutlery might become unusable when soaked in hot liquids.

"There are many choices in addition to paper pulp, including wood, bamboo, bagasse pulp, wood pulp and straw pulp. Local restaurants serve a wide variety of food, and they should choose suitable tableware based on the different dishes they serve," Tse said.

The minister added that restaurants will not be required by law to charge customers for non-plastic tableware.]]>
