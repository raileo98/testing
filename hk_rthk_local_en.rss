    <![CDATA[Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong is on track to becoming one of the first jurisdictions to adopt sustainability disclosure requirements in line with global standards, as the government vowed to do more to support green energy transition in the region.

Speaking at a forum to mark Earth Day, the finance chief said the government is committed to launching a roadmap this year to align local sustainability disclosure requirements with the International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards.

He also pointed out that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will soon release a local green classification framework that aligns with rules adopted by the European Union and the mainland to combat so-called “green washing”, the act of providing misleading information about products’ environmental benefits.

Separately, Chan noted the SAR could do more to support green transition finance in the region, which would involve investing in green sectors and projects, as well as assisting carbon-intensive industries in their net-zero transformation.

“We have the expertise, infrastructure, and regulatory framework that support international investors and different transition projects,” he said.

“There’s clear room to explore how Hong Kong could better help channel capital to support the transition of high-emitting sectors and heavy polluting industries in the region,” he added.]]>

    Environmental survey for new tech hub plan approved

    <![CDATA[An advisory council on Monday conditionally approved the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the San Tin Technopole project, despite heavy criticism.

Green groups had last week called the report the worst wetland assessment since EIA regulations came into place in 1998.

The Advisory Council on the Environment approved the EIA at a meeting, but it listed eight conditions, including the submission of a habitat creation and management plan (HCMP) to the Environmental Protection Department nine months before pond filling works begin.

Other conditions included setting up wildlife corridors with a diameter of at least ten metres wide, submitting a plan on enhancing wetlands in Mai Po, and setting up an environmental committee to monitor the implementation of ecological mitigation measures.

Terence Tsang, the department's assistant director, said authorities will ensure the eight conditions will be met throughout the development of the tech hub.

"There is a very stringent mechanism to review that submission. Also, if in case the effectiveness of the measures recommended in the HCMP was found to not achieve the expected results... there is some kind of monitoring mechanism," he told reporters.

Green groups said the EIA had missed two species of breeding birds and also did not share the actual number of black-faced spoonbills counted in the survey.

Additionally, they said that the assessment had violated at least 35 statutory requirements and omitted crucial data points.

They also said the report should be resubmitted, as the area for the San Tin Technopole project had been expanded.

But council chairman John Chai said that that would not be necessary as the assessment already covered issues like ecology, fishponds and wetlands.

"Despite that there is a difference in the area, the coverage of the development, the environmental issues that need to be studied have not changed... So in other words, it's the same kind of study," Chai said.   	 

Responding to the development, environmental groups said they were highly disappointed by the decision, stressing that the San Tin Technopole project will cause irreversible damage to wetlands.

In a statement, they said the conditions laid out by the department did not specifically address the deficiencies in the San Tin EIA report, which they regarded as "invalid, incomplete, unscientific, and unreliable". 

Construction work for the tech hub will begin late this year.

    'Common sense for hep B patients to get antivirals'

    <![CDATA[It is “widely known medical knowledge” that hepatitis B patients taking steroids should also be prescribed antivirals, a renal specialist told the Coroner’s Court. 

Lui Sing-leung, who chairs the Hospital Authority’s central renal committee, also said a doctor who treated liver disease patient Tang Kwai-sze should have detailed the discussions on the use of steroids during a consultation session in his medical notes.

Tang had been taking steroids to treat her chronic kidney disease before she underwent two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017. She died in August that year at the age of 44.

The two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for allegedly failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.

Giving evidence on Monday, Lui said while the Hospital Authority had yet to issue a guideline on antiviral prescription for non-cancer patients at the time of Tang’s steroid treatment, it was “widely known” that such drugs should be given to the patient. 

He also told the inquest, before Coroner Monica Chow and a five-person jury, that Lam’s notes only said the patient was briefed on the “pros and cons of steroids” and agreed to using the drug. 

“Lam should have written down clearly the pros and cons of steroids that he had highlighted, because [relapse] is an important, serious potential complication,” Lui said.

Lui added that doctors who see the same patient subsequently might only rely on the previous medical notes, but not the hospital’s clinical management system.

Chan, the other doctor who later saw Tang, did not follow up with the patient as to why antivirals had not been prescribed when he should have, the court heard. 

Another expert witness, Professor Grace Wong from the Chinese University’s medical school, agreed that a hepatitis B flare-up, in which the level of liver enzymes rises abruptly, is mainly caused by the absence of antivirals during a high-dose steroid treatment.

Wong, a specialist in gastroenterology and hepatology, said a study she’s part of found that even short courses of a large dosage of steroids could increase the risk of a hepatitis flare-up, and such patients should receive antivirals regardless of the duration of the treatment.

She also said while it should be “common sense” to prescribe antivirals along with steroids, the practice was not written “in black and white” before the patient’s case came to light, so one could not expect all doctors to follow as such. 

The inquest hearing continues.]]>

    Plastic ban gets support but 'more can be done'

    <![CDATA[People were generally supportive of the plastic cutlery ban that took effect on Monday, but some said it was inconvenient and restaurants could do more to protect the environment.

Restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils like straws and cutlery, but plastic containers and cups are still allowed for takeaways.

Lamini, an office worker in Wan Chai, said cutting down on plastic products is the right thing to do.

“By removing plastic one by one, I think it can only be positive for our children and future generations. I agree to pay maybe a little bit more to have something made from paper and I think we have to do it now,” he told RTHK.

Nevaeh, a student enjoying a drink at a cafe in Admiralty, said she did not mind using a paper straw, even though it became soft after a while.

“I got used to it because they only provide paper straws, so you’ll just accept it,” she said.

But Luk, a worker, said paper straws just do not work and restaurants should switch to reusable ones, like stainless steel straws, for dine-in customers.

“They should have thought it through and tested the straw first,” he said.

“I could barely drink from the paper straw. I had to take it out and drink from the glass, because it was flattened.”

Michael, the director of a steakhouse in Wan Chai, said he understands that eco-friendly cutlery may not be as useful as plastic cutlery and so he is offering his customers different options when ordering takeaway food.

"If they want plastic tableware it’ll cost them HK$5. Of course people will prefer to dine in if they’re having steak. If they order takeaways they can ask us to slice the steaks for them,” he said.

Meanwhile, the owner of a Vietnamese noodle joint said it will switch to paper pulp cutlery in a week or so, when the stock of plastic tableware is used up.

But she said eco-friendly alternatives are more costly and will make it harder for small businesses to stay afloat.

“It costs around 30 percent more. But the economy is in a tough shape, how can we transfer the cost onto the customers? They may not come if we put up the price,” she said.

“We chose sturdier paper tableware because we serve soup noodles... and they’re more expensive.”]]>

    New growth charts introduced after 31 years

    <![CDATA[Health authorities on Monday said they are updating how they measure children's growth for the first time since 1993 to reflect the fact that today's young people are typically taller and heavier. 

New charts are being rolled out to help check how a child's weight, height, body mass index and head circumference compare with those of their peers. 

Dr Thomas Chung, from the Department of Health, worked with colleagues from Chinese University and the University of Hong Kong. He said there was a clear trend upwards in the height and weight of children and adolescents in the territory.

"When we compare the new charts, HK2020, with that of the old charts, HK1993, the median height of boys and girls at age 18, they are two centimetres taller than those in the median height of the same age in 1993," he said.

"There may be many factors like nutrition, and improvements in society, so this is expected and seen in other places in the world as well."

Chung also said they compared their current data to data routinely collected by the health department to validate and discover trends, adding the pandemic did not affect their results. 

"We collected more than 21,000 data from children and adolescents to construct the new Hong Kong 2020 growth references. These growth charts contain nine centile lines, as compared to the seven centile lines in the old charts," he said.

"The two additional extreme lines help frontline professionals have a more accurate and detailed assessment on the growth of the children, so that they can be referred to other specialists if necessary."

Dr Tony Nelson, a paediatrics specialist from Chinese University, said it was important to check local data instead of relying on global studies.

"In terms of our local data showing that infants are lighter at birth and girls are slightly shorter, I think this just reflects the importance of local data," he said. 

"So our local data shows that for the Hong Kong population, it's not like the WHO study, which was from six countries globally and included countries like the Netherlands, and India, and America, and other places. So I think this just reflects the local genetics, the local population here."

The Department of Health will start using the new growth charts in maternal and child health centres in July, and in student health service centres in September. 

The Hospital Authority will implement them in phases starting in September, and aims to have them in all its facilities by the end of the year.]]>

    '70 percent of eateries still using plastic items'

    <![CDATA[A catering sector leader on Monday said about 70 percent of Hong Kong's 18,000 restaurants are still handing out plastic cutlery, despite the first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics coming into effect. 

The government says it won't issue fines for breaches of the ban over the next six months. 

The president of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, Simon Wong, said many small and medium-sized restaurants are still using plastic, because it's cheaper than alternatives. 

Wong told an RTHK programme that he hopes people will get into the habit of taking their own cutlery with them when they go out for food, so they don't have to pay extra for eco-friendly options.

"The cost may be passed on to some people, because they may have to pay additional fees. However, I hope that people can, in the future, get into the habit of using their own tableware. It would be best if they can bring their own cutlery, as that way neither party needs to consider the matter of cost," he said.

The ban also means hotels can no longer provide guests with free plastic items, including disposable razors, toothbrushes and shower caps.

On RTHK's Backchat programme, the executive director of the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners, Caspar Tsui, said the industry is struggling to find alternative products.

"There has been a little difficulty in changing some of the products. Not because we were not willing to do it, but mainly because, you know, it's difficult to find sufficient suppliers and the quality of products that we need to maintain the service," he said. 

"We're adjusting slowly, not because we don't want to, but it takes time."]]>

    <![CDATA[The 9th Hong Kong Games began on Sunday with an opening ceremony held at the Coliseum. 

Cheerleading, a wushu performance and skateboarding were just some of the spectacles kicking off the biennial sports competition.

Athletes from the territory's 18 districts entered the venue before table tennis players Minnie Soo and Ding Ning, wushu athlete Samuel Hui and badminton player Wang Yilyu took part in a torch relay, lighting the cauldron together to signify the beginning of the games.

Under Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Raistlin Lau gave the opening speech. He said President Xi Jinping has emphasised the importance of sports for improving people's health and realising the Chinese dream.

"The biennial Hong Kong Games is a major sports event for all Hong Kong citizens. This is not only a good opportunity for Hong Kong athletes to show their strength, but also an excellent platform to promote 'Sports for All'," Lau said.

"This year, the Hong Kong Games has entered its ninth session. I know that in the next two months, there will be more than 4,600 athletes competing in eight events and a total of more than 1,000 games."

The inter-district sports event runs until June 9, with competitions in athletics, badminton, 3-on-3 basketball, futsal, swimming, table tennis, tennis and volleyball.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Sunday explained its decision not to hold a march on May 1, saying members don't want one and it has come up with "more effective" channels for workers to express their opinions. 

The group hasn't held its customary Labour Day march since before the Covid pandemic. 

"The some 400,000 members and 200 unions gathered on the platform of the FTU to promote labour values and the labour spirit. We are holding a series of activities in the upcoming week simply because that's what workers want. Not holding a march doesn't mean we are avoiding anything," said FTU president and lawmaker Stanley Ng. 

"We think those activities are more effective channels to let workers express their opinions," he told reporters at a press conference.  

FTU chairman and lawmaker Kingsley Wong said as part of its Labour Day campaign, the group has invited senior government officials, including Chief Executive John Lee, Chief Secretary Eric Chan and Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, to meet frontline workers from various industries to learn about their needs. 

He added that the group will also submit proposals on labour matters to the government next week.]]>

    <![CDATA[Two men have been arrested after several renovation and engineering companies were scammed out of a total of HK$1.5 million, police said on Sunday.

Officers said the companies were given work on what were purported to be school projects and were persuaded to use particular suppliers for materials. 

The firms were tricked into believing they had received deposits for the work, via forged screenshots of remittance records or cheques that bounced, before they made payments to the "suppliers".

"Once the victims made payments to those fake suppliers, they would lose all communication to the [fraudsters] and suppliers. Then the companies eventually realised they had been scammed,” said Chief Inspector Tam Tsz-wai.  

Officers said they arrested two men, aged 33 and 44, in Yuen Long on Friday, on suspicion of obtaining property by deception. 

Tam urged companies to check with their banks that their account balances increase following payments from clients, to ensure that the transactions have not been manipulated.]]>

    <![CDATA[Magic mushrooms, marijuana candy and LSD stamps were among a haul of drugs worth around HK$12 million seized in Yau Tong last week, police said on Sunday.

Officers said they raided a factory building in the area on April 19 and another the following day, after discovering that the sites were being used for manufacturing and trafficking dangerous drugs destined to be sold in Hong Kong. 

A 25-year-old man was arrested. 

"During the operation, our officers seized drugs with a total market value of more than 12 million dollars, including 12.5 kilogrammes of heroin, 8 kilogrammes of marijuana flowers, 270 sticks of marijuana vape juice, 500 millilitres of marijuana oil, marijuana candy and cookies, magic mushrooms and LSD stamps," said Senior Inspector Matthew Fung.

"Our officers also examined tools found in one of the units suspected to be used for manufacturing and packaging the drugs. We believe that this operation has successfully cut off the supply chain of this drug trafficking group."

Fung said officers were trying to trace the source of the raw materials used to produce the drugs found.]]>

    <![CDATA[Trees came down in several parts of the city, some rail services were disrupted and the observatory reported a waterspout on Sunday, as strong winds and thunderstorms battered Hong Kong.

The Peak Tram stopped running after a tree came down on Barker Road, while another fell on Wylie Road in Ho Ma Tin, temporarily blocking traffic. 

There was disruption to East Rail Line services for around an hour in the afternoon, with emergency maintenance work taking place at University Station after the wind apparently ripped away part of the canopy above one of the platforms. 

Officials said some high-speed train services between Hong Kong and the mainland would be delayed due to the bad weather conditions. 

Meanwhile, speed limits on the bridge to Macau and Zhuhai were reduced due to the high winds, the Transport Department said.

The Amber Rainstorm Warning was issued at 10am and while it was cancelled at 1.45pm, a thunderstorm warning remained in place.  

The observatory said intense gusts reaching 80 kilometres per hour or above could continue to affect the territory, as it also warned of possible flooding from rivers. 

At around 9.30 in the morning, a waterspout was spotted in Clear Water Bay, the observatory said.

It added that more thundery showers are forecast throughout the rest of the week. 

Meanwhile, authorities in Guangdong warned of the risk of floods from rivers, waterways and reservoirs after days of torrential rain. 

Officials in localities and municipalities across the province were told to begin emergency planning to avert any disasters.

    <![CDATA[Financial secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said new measures announced by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to cooperate with Hong Kong's capital market demonstrate the central government's support for the SAR.

Writing on his blog, Chan said the commission will support leading mainland companies in listing in Hong Kong, by stepping up communication and coordination among government departments.

The official said he learnt during a trip to Hangzhou and Suzhou last week that many companies have applied to list in Hong Kong, or are considering doing so.

He said the companies like Hong Kong for its institutional advantages, including intellectual property protection and internationalisation, as well as the synergy with other Greater Bay Area cities.

"They hope to use Hong Kong as their preferred springboard and platform to enter the international market, including establishing treasury centres and even international headquarters in Hong Kong," Chan said.

The finance chief said having more companies with great potential listed on Hong Kong's bourse will attract more international capital and solidify the SAR's status as an international financial hub.

Chan said that some technology firms from Hangzhou are also setting up research centres in the SAR as the two cities are about to establish a platform for technological collaboration.]]>

    <![CDATA[Environment and Ecology Secretary Tse Chin-wan says businesses do not have to worry too much about a ban on plastic tableware that takes effect from Monday, as it's not the government's goal to "punish" them with the policy.

Writing on his blog, the official said vendors can use up their plastic products during a six-month grace period so they will not be wasted.

Tse added that even when the grace period ends, authorities will educate vendors first in case of violation, instead of taking enforcement action immediately.

"We understand that a process of changing customs is needed, and it will take time for businesses to adjust the way they operate to comply with the ban. So, we will try our best to provide appropriate assistance when implementing the policy," Tse wrote.

The official said the catering, retail and hotel sectors all support the measure that will see restaurants banned from selling and using polystyrene tableware and plastic cutlery, while hotels will no longer be allowed to provide free plastic products like toothbrushes.

Tse said many hotels have switched to wooden toothbrushes and combs, while some eateries have bought non-plastic cutlery.

He called on restaurants to choose suitable eco-tableware, noting that there have been concerns that paper pulp cutlery might become unusable when soaked in hot liquids.

"There are many choices in addition to paper pulp, including wood, bamboo, bagasse pulp, wood pulp and straw pulp. Local restaurants serve a wide variety of food, and they should choose suitable tableware based on the different dishes they serve," Tse said.

The minister added that restaurants will not be required by law to charge customers for non-plastic tableware.]]>

    <![CDATA[Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk on Sunday said care teams tasked with supporting people from ethnic minority groups will start providing services later this year.

At an Equal Opportunities Commission event, Cheuk said the government is committed to helping non-Chinese residents integrate into the community, saying they are vital to Hong Kong society. 

“They are no doubt an integral part of the Hong Kong family, working dutifully and diligently across various professions and areas. Our non-ethnic Chinese brothers and sisters have made equal contributions to the growth of Hong Kong,” Cheuk said.

The deputy chief secretary said that as well as the care teams, preparations are underway for two new ethnic minority support centres, in Kowloon and the New Territories.

Cheuk said there are over 300,000 non-Chinese people in the SAR, many of them working in various industries including government positions.

“In terms of employment, the government encourages departments to design their own language tests, to provide an additional pathway for ethnic minority applicants to meet the appointment requirements on language proficiency,” he said.

“For instance, more than 300 ethnic minority applicants have passed the Chinese or English written examination designed for police recruitment. This would allow ethnic minorities who may not have participated in public examinations in Hong Kong to gain the opportunity to join and work for the government.”

Cheuk also noted that a pilot counselling service centre for ethnic minority residents launched at the end of last year.]]>

    <![CDATA[Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said on Sunday that Hong Kong's shortage of talent in the innovation and technology sector will improve with time.

He made the comment on a radio programme after 59 local, mainland and overseas enterprises signed Memoranda of Understanding with the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park last week.

Sun said dozens of tech enterprises have expanded their businesses in the territory, with many of them in the life and health, new energy and microelectronics technology sectors. 

However, he said, there is a lack of manpower in the industry.

"I feel that we are certainly lacking talents in this area, but it's already getting better. We have plans to attract talent through the Technology Talent Admission Scheme and the innovation and technology institutions set up," he told Commercial Radio. 

"All the innovation and technology policies we have launched can attract and train local talents, so I believe if we continue in this direction, we will have more and more talents in the next few years."

Sun stressed that policies implemented must be consistent with the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint, to boost high-quality development in the field.]]>

    'Restaurants to utilize non-plastic grace period'

    <![CDATA[A representative of the catering industry on Sunday said that many small and medium-sized restaurants will continue to use plastic utensils despite the upcoming ban on the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.

Speaking on RTHK's Hashtag Hong Kong, Simon Wong, the president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said many restaurant owners will take advantage of a six-month adjustment period after the ban takes effect on Monday. 

During this time, government officials will focus on educating people rather than strictly enforcing the ban.

"Many restaurant operators are, at the moment, not eager to use non-plastic tableware as the government is giving a six-month grace period to the trade, such that operators will not be fined if they do not follow the regulation on and after April 22," he said. 

"On the other hand, it would give enough time for importers and wholesalers as well as retailers to consume or deal with their inventories within the allowable period. This period would also offer more time for the catering industry to find more suitable products to suit their budget and needs."

Wong mentioned that large restaurant chains would be the first to switch to non-plastic alternatives. 

However, he added that small and medium-sized restaurants are concerned about the increased costs in the current tough economic climate.

Wong noted that eco-friendly options are currently 20 to 30 per cent more expensive than plastic utensils, but he believes the cost will come down in the future.

He urged the government to step up education and public awareness campaigns to inform people about the importance of reducing waste and protecting the environment.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA) said all DSE exam centres must return unused question-and-answer books to the authority starting from Saturday.

The announcement came after the English listening exam paper was said to have been uploaded to social media platform Xiaohongshu, and police arrested a 23-year-old woman in relation to the incident.

A spokesman for the HKEAA said for exams held on Saturday onwards, the centres must return all unused question-and-answer books to the collection centre on the same day.

The HKEAA said the arrangement would help manage examination materials more effectively and minimise the risk of information being made available publicly on the internet.]]>

    <![CDATA[The government on Saturday strongly condemned a statement issued by foreign ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) countries and the High Representative of the European Union, saying it deliberately misled the public and smeared the National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.

A government spokesman described the statement as "unfounded and biased". He stressed that it was Hong Kong's constitutional duty to safeguard national security. 

"Many common law jurisdictions, including western countries such as the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as Singapore, have enacted multiple pieces of legislation to safeguard national security," he said. 

"Turning a blind eye to the fact and making exaggerated remarks, the G7 foreign ministers and the High Representative of the EU have demonstrated typical political hegemony and hypocrisy with double standards." 

The G7 statement expressed concerns about civil and political rights and freedoms in Hong Kong in light of the introduction of the National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance under Article 23 of the Basic Law. 

The government spokesman dismissed the criticism, saying that the legislation would not affect normal business operations, adding that law-abiding businessmen and travellers visiting Hong Kong would not engage in activities that endanger national security and therefore would not unknowingly violate the law.

He added that a majority of the submissions received during the public consultation on the legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law were supportive and positive, reflecting a strong consensus in society for the legislation.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Department of Health on Saturday said it had ordered the Union Hospital to hand in a report after hackers attacked its computer system.

Responding to media enquiries, the department said it was notified by the hospital on Monday about the cyberattack, which affected operations.

It said initial understandings showed that the incident did not involve patients' information or affect the safety of hospital services.

The authorities said the investigation is ongoing and it had ordered the hospital to submit a detailed report within a month.

The hospital earlier said it had reported the case to the police as well as the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, and announced it had stepped up measures to prevent further attacks.

A team of cyber security experts has been appointed to conduct a thorough system inspection and recovery in order to ensure medical service continuity," it wrote in a statement.]]>
