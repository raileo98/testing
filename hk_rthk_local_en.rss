    <![CDATA[The executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, on Thursday said tourist figures for the first day of the mainland's Golden Week holiday were in line with expectations.  

The Immigration Department said arrivals in the SAR exceeded 460,000 on May 1, including around 180,000 from the mainland. 

Some tourists complained on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu that bad weather marred a fireworks show over Victoria Harbour on Wednesday evening. 

Chui told an RTHK programme that he thinks the visitor numbers would have been even higher if the weather had been better.   

"Indeed, some people joked that they didn't just see the fireworks but smoke as well. I believe this is to do with the weather. But I think visitors who came to Hong Kong were generally satisfied. It's very common to say a few words on social media platforms," he said. 
 
Echoing his views, wholesale and retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu said items such as jewellery and cosmetics were popular among tourists on May 1. 

Shiu added that he hopes the government will continue to improve publicity for mega events and support airlines to beef up their flight capacity.]]>

    New flu trend detection model for better vaccines

    <![CDATA[A Chinese University researcher said a new computing model could help the authorities make better choices in selecting the strain of flu they vaccinate people against. 

Health officials have to choose which vaccine to order ahead of each flu season. 

Maggie Wang, who developed the new model, known as beth-1, with colleagues from the Faculty of Medicine, said it could predict how the virus would change in the future.

She said the model would give authorities early warnings of emerging virus variants, particularly for the H3N2 virus, the H1N1 virus and the influenza B virus. 

"This information is particularly important for the WHO (World Health Organisation) because each year or each season, the next season's influenza vaccine strain should be determined earlier, that is almost nine to 12 months ahead of the target season. A prediction model can provide critical information to inform the decision makers of the optimal vaccine strain to select," she said. 

"For pharmaceutical companies, the forecasting model is also very useful because the manufacturing of the influenza vaccine has a really compact timeline. So earlier prediction can give more time and the buffer for the manufacturers to prepare the vaccine development and manufacturing."

Wang added that their research team has already been working closely with institutions in the mainland to conduct animal experiments for manufacturing more effective vaccines using the beth-1 model.

"We did the prospective validation using mice model. That is, we predict the next season, the future season's representative viral strain, and then use this strain to make the vaccine to immunize the mice, and we also immunize another group of mice using the current vaccines," she said. 

"And after a few months, when the target season comes, we collect the circulating viruses from the Prince of Wales Hospital, and then use this circulating virus to challenge the immunized mice, and compare how strongly antibody response in these two groups of mice. The outcome is that our model-predicted strain generates significantly higher, or non-inferior neutralization titer, antibody response against the circulating viruses."]]>

    <![CDATA[Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk on Wednesday said a trial has shown that there are still many problems with the government's long-delayed waste charging programme.

The pay-as-you-throw scheme was tested at 14 locations from last month, covering homes, shops and restaurants, but only about half of the households participated by using designated bags to dispose of trash.

Cheuk said a working group had been meeting every week to discuss the plan.

"According to our initial observations, there are many problems. We think that if we introduce the waste charging scheme, we must have a consensus and support from Hong Kong people," he said.

"That's because this policy directly affects the seven million people in Hong Kong. There must be favourable conditions in various areas in order to roll the scheme out smoothly."

Officials had earlier said it remained to be seen whether a full rollout would go ahead on August 1 as planned.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Tourism Board on Wednesday said an 8pm pyrotechnic display over Victoria Harbour will go ahead as planned. 

The show had been in doubt because of inclement weather, but the board says forecasts show it's fine to go ahead, warning people attending to bring rain gear and check the conditions.

It's good news for tourists in town for the Labour Day holiday who had been anxiously checking the weather ahead of the fireworks show, which is the first in a series planned to mark holidays and festivals.

A tourist, who is making a three-day trip from Zhejiang province, said it is her first time in Hong Kong and she really wants to see the fireworks.

"I really want to see it...I think the scene will be fascinating. I've watched similar shows on the mainland, but I think that may be different in Hong Kong," she told RTHK.

And some mainland tourists said they would not be staying overnight because of the high prices for hotels during the holiday.

"We will go back to Shenzhen at night, but we may come again on Friday. The price of a hotel room in Shenzhen is just a third of that in Hong Kong. That's a huge difference," a tourist said.

The Immigration Department said as of 4pm, there were about 237,000 tourist arrivals, and that includes nearly 140,000 mainland tourists.

    <![CDATA[The Observatory is verifying social media posts which apparently showed hail falling in Hong Kong as the city was hit with storms overnight.

During an amber warning issued at about 9.30pm on Tuesday, posts from several social media platforms reported that hail was falling in Yuen Long. One video on Instagram showed residents there running for cover.

The Observatory said it is verifying the social media posts, and noted that there were reports of hail fall from Macau and Zhuhai.

“Last year, there were also hail reports in March and April,” Betty Mak, a scientific officer at the Observatory, told RTHK, noting that there is nothing unusual for it to hail this time of year.

“We’ll consider all the data and observations including the stability of the atmosphere and analysis of radar images and hail reports from nearby areas or locally to assess."

“Members of the public should consider bringing rain gear when going out,” Mak added.

The forecaster also said lightning struck the east of the territory more than 6,400 times between 10pm and 10am. “Violent gusts” of over 100km per hour were also recorded in Cheung Chau early on Wednesday morning.

Meanwhile, a concert that was being held in Central was forced to stop midway when the amber signal came into effect on Tuesday night.

And several flights were affected by the weather, with some being delayed or rerouted to land in other airports in the Pearl River Delta area.

    'More weight on GDP growth needed for minimum wage'

    <![CDATA[The chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Wednesday said authorities should give more weight to the growth of the SAR's economy in a new formula for calculating the minimum wage.

The Executive Council on Tuesday approved recommendations to review the minimum wage every year instead of every two years, and under the new mechanism, the minimum wage would not be reduced.

The new formula will take into account the consumer price index and 20 percent of the difference between the previous year’s GDP figure and economic growth in the past decade, with a cap of one percentage point.

FTU chairman Kingsley Wong welcomed the change, but he said the hourly minimum wage would only increase by about HK$1 every year under the new mechanism, which is not ideal.

"Grassroots workers should also be able to share the results of economic prosperity. It's too low to only include [20 percent of the GDP growth difference]. This is what the mechanism is short of," he told an RTHK radio programme.

"We hope that employers, employees, officials and scholars should review the mechanism, for example, in every five years."

He said calculations should include 30 percent of the GDP growth difference instead.

Speaking on the same programme, the president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, Simon Wong, said the catering sector will not see a huge increase in operating costs because of the new mechanism.

"Under the labour shortage situation, the hourly wage for the catering sector is a lot higher than the minimum wage... For temporary positions, restaurants mostly have to pay workers at least HK$50 to HK$60 per hour, and some Chinese restaurants even pay their frontline staff HK$80 or more," he said.

Meanwhile, labour secretary Chris Sun brushed aside concerns that the new mechanism would undermine Hong Kong's competitiveness. 

Speaking to reporters, he said the government has considered many factors.

"We hope to ensure that the wage won't be too low, while minimising the loss of low-paid jobs. We also have to consider the competitiveness of the city at the same time."

"We can't see how the modified minimum wage mechanism would affect the competitiveness of Hong Kong and the business sector," he added.

Chief Executive John Lee, meanwhile, said on social media that the changes could protect grassroots workers. He expressed the hope that officials could work with various sectors to build a "reasonable, fair and safe" environment for workers.

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Observatory warned on Tuesday evening that hail could affect the SAR after it was reported in the Pearl River Delta. 

Hail was reported in Macau as authorities there called on residents to stay indoors.

In Hong Kong, the amber rainstorm warning was issued at 9:30pm.

The forecaster called on people to be alert and seek safe shelter, as violent gusts reaching 110 kilometres per hour affect the territory. 

The Labour Department called on employers to avoid assigning workers to carry out electrical work, and protect the safety of those engaged in such tasks.

"Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by the rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent electric shock as the air would be more humid," said a spokesperson from the department.]]>

    <![CDATA[The number of negative equity cases reached a 20-year high in the first quarter, figures released by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) showed.

According to the HKMA, there were 32,073 cases at the end of March, up 27 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 and the most since the first quarter of 2004.

The HKMA noted that the loans had mainly been taken out by bank staff or linked to mortgage insurance, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio.

Government figures out last week showed home prices rebounded in March, snapping a 10-month losing streak. That's after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech on February 28.]]>

    <![CDATA[A lawmaker and a representative of small and medium-sized firms on Tuesday welcomed the new way of calculating Hong Kong's minimum wage, which now takes into account the city's economic development and consumer prices.

Danny Lau, the honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said the shake-up is fair for business operators and workers, but it is unreasonable there is no chance of the minimum wage being reduced if times get tough for businesses.

"The only thing that we worry is you can only [increase it], you cannot decrease the minimum wage," he said.  

Under the new changes, the minimum wage would not be reduced but frozen even if the formula produces a negative number. 

Asked if it would put pressure on bosses in small and medium-sized firms when the economy is not doing well, Priscilla Wong, who chairs the Minimum Wage Commission, said a balance needs to be struck.  

“These are the people with the lowest ability to bargain, the least bargaining power. And as a society, we are hoping that their wages do not go through vertically down and go down to the point that we lose our wage floor,” she told a media briefing. 

Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing welcomed the new mechanism, but he told RTHK the administration should give greater weight to GDP in the calculations.

"We hope the proportion that [accounts for] the growth in GDP can be more. This means if we have a large growth of the GDP and then we can have an increase in minimum wages level, that's very important because it allows our grassroots workers to share the fruit of economic development," he said.

Liberal Party's catering sector lawmaker, Tommy Cheung, earlier said the minimum wage could hurt the SAR's competitiveness, calling on authorities to scrap it altogether. 

But labour minister Chris Sun dismissed the suggestion, saying the new changes ensure there is room for low-paid workers to maintain their purchasing power. 

“The design of the formula is to make sure that while we remain competitive, we have to also take care of the needs of those at the very low level. We're just talking about a small number of workers. And as a society, we should help them to make sure that at the very low level, we have enough room for them to be able to earn.”]]>

    <![CDATA[The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a shake-up of the way Hong Kong's minimum wage is decided, with the wage floor to be reviewed every year in future instead of every two. 

Calculations will include the SAR's economic growth rate in the previous year, as well as consumer prices. 

There'll be no chance of the minimum wage being reduced regardless of what the figures suggest, with any negative calculation leading to a freeze instead. 

The government said it is making the changes based on recommendations from the Minimum Wage Commission, which consulted labour and employer groups as well as academics on the matter last year.

The first minimum wage under the new mechanism will be set in two years' time.

"The recommendations of the [commission] have struck an appropriate balance between the objectives of forestalling excessively low wages and minimising the loss of low-paid jobs, while giving due regard to sustaining Hong Kong's economic growth and competitiveness," said Labour Secretary Chris Sun.

Hong Kong's minimum wage is currently set at HK$40 per hour. The Minimum Wage Commission is to submit a report by the end of October on its recommendations for any change.]]>

    <![CDATA[Health officials on Tuesday warned that an extended flu season would continue for some time, with more outbreaks and serious cases. 

The Centre for Health Protection urged the public to remain vigilant as Hong Kong has seen a rise in flu infections, with more than 500 adults suffering serious complications or dying since January. Most of them are over 65 or have chronic illnesses.

There have been 22 severe flu cases among children, including three deaths. 

Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, from the Centre for Health Protection, said health authorities were closely monitoring the situation. 

"The predominant flu strain has shifted from H3 to H1, resulting in another wave of infections. We expect this wave to continue for a few weeks, but it's difficult to say exactly how long," she said. 

"We are closely monitoring other regions of the world, as Hong Kong residents travel a lot. Influenza B is still circulating in some parts outside Hong Kong, so we cannot rule out the possibility of a further change in the flu strain."

Health authorities urged the public to seek medical attention if they experience flu-like symptoms.]]>

    <![CDATA[Scores of movie lovers on Tuesday bade farewell to President Cinema in Causeway Bay, bringing the curtain down on almost six decades of showing films. 

Its operator, Newport Circuit, had announced last week that the theatre on Jaffe Road was closing after Tuesday, though it did not say why.

Still, Newport Circuit thanked customers for their support throughout the years.

While some people were just there to snap pictures, others bought tickets for the final shows at the theatre that first opened in 1966.

Leo, an actor, said it was a pity that a platform which showcased cinematic productions was disappearing.

"I've been here one or two times many years ago," he said. "I don't care if it's old or if the seat is good or bad, I just want to [catch a film] for the last time in this cinema."

Another movie-goer, Alice, said she was watching a film at the cinema for the first time.

"This kind of old cinema is very rare. They disappear when the industry is on decline and not many people are buying tickets, so I think if I have the chance to sit down and watch a movie [here] once, I'd like to go," she said.

A regular customer, meanwhile, said the cinema brought back a lot of memories for her, from the days when people could still buy grilled squid before going into the theatre.

"There's nothing we can do. Now everyone watches movies at home," she said.

Last week, a Golden Harvest cinema in Kai Tak also closed down, following the end of its tenancy contract.]]>

    <![CDATA[Police on Tuesday said they have arrested and charged a man and were searching for another over a crane collapse that killed three workers at a construction site in 2022. 

Officers announced the arrest of a 35-year-old former project manager with the main contractor involved in the building construction in Sau Mau Ping.

He has been charged with manslaughter and will appear in Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on Thursday.

Meanwhile, a warrant was issued for a 72-year-old structural engineer. 

Aggressive Construction Company, the contractor for the site on Anderson Road, confirmed earlier that a former employee had been arrested. 

The company added that it is being prosecuted over the crane collapse.

    <![CDATA[Scholars on Tuesday called on the government to offer more support for people who look after children or elderly relatives while living in subdivided housing.

In a survey conducted by Lingnan University and Chinese University, 95 percent of the 315 caregivers surveyed, who live in subdivided homes, were found to be stressed out, while 20.5 percent of respondents exhibited signs of depression. 

Speaking at a press conference, Ruby Lai from Lingnan University's Department of Sociology and Social Policy said caregivers had been struggling with stress from the unsuitable living conditions, expensive rents and excessive workloads. 

"What we see is that there are many spatial constraints at home, like there's no separations of kitchen and toilet, or there's no independent cooking place, so that they have to set up a makeshift cooking space for them to cook every time and then to pack up all the things to leave this space for their children to do homework," she explained.

Lai called on the government to ensure better quality of life for caregivers living in such conditions. 

She also called on authorities to roll out cash subsidies to relieve the stress faced by caregivers in subdivided housing, and strengthen community support.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said there's plenty for tourists to do in Hong Kong during the Labour Day Golden Week holiday, even if Wednesday night's pyrotechnic display might be cancelled due to weather. 

Authorities had warned that the 10-minute show at Victoria Harbour on May 1 could be called off if rain and thunderstorms happen as predicted. A decision would be made on Wednesday afternoon.

The display is scheduled to be the first in a series of occasions marking the city’s mega events and festivals.

Lee also said weather would not affect other events during the national holiday this week.

"We want to do the best to ensure that [the show] will be most welcome and enjoyed by everybody, tourists and Hong Kong people. But of course, the weather is always unpredictable," he said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.

"There are a wide range of activities that have been arranged to welcome visitors during Golden Week."]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said people are getting to grips with a ban on single-use plastic utensils, a week after it took effect.

Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, he said there are signs of people steadily changing their habits, citing a media report that said two-thirds of people are no longer taking plastic utensils in restaurants.

On complaints from some people that alternative cutlery products are of low quality, Lee said he thinks suppliers and restaurants will get better.

"Of course during the process there's always room for us to make improvements. For restaurant operators and alternative [utensil] suppliers, I believe [they] will continue to improve their work and they will continue to supply different types of alternatives to disposable tableware," he said.

The CE added that Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan will continue to explain the new policy, after questions arose as to whether plastic containers can be used for takeaway food.

Lee said authorities will keep an eye on the way people adapt to the initial phase of the ban, as well as the supply of substitute products, before deciding what to do next.

While restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils like straws and cutlery, the government had earlier said that plastic containers and cups – which are still allowed for takeaways at the moment – will be banned completely in the next phase.]]>

    <![CDATA[A paediatrician said on Tuesday that Hong Kong's flu season is running longer than normal this year, with cases still increasing rather than tapering off as expected. 

Dr Mike Kwan from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that the extended flu season reflected a global phenomenon, with people's immunity against viruses falling when measures were imposed during the Covid pandemic.

He says Hong Kong now faces what he called a tridemic, with people threatened by flu, Covid and another respiratory infection, RSV respiratory syncytial virus, as well as other conditions.

Asked when the flu season would conclude, he told RTHK's Janice Wong: "We cannot make a prediction yet because the number is still rising and we are still seeing so many of the severe cases. Unfortunately, we hear about the news of another fatal case yesterday. This is very sad.

"So I cannot make a prediction at this moment, but I just hope that the citizens can just go and have the flu vaccine if they have not yet received the vaccine."

Kwan said acceptance of the flu vaccine remained relatively low in Hong Kong. He also suggested people wear masks in crowded areas, use proper hygiene and stay home if they have the flu.]]>

    <![CDATA[The founder of an NGO said on Tuesday that many Hong Kong social workers are experiencing burnout as they face a range of challenges, including an increasing workload as more people in society face difficulty with their mental health.

Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme,  Chou Wah-shan from the mental health group Dreams Possible said a survey conducted with University of Hong Kong academics found that 93 percent of the 255 social workers interviewed experienced a moderate level of work-related stress. 

He said the study also found signs of depression in 68 percent of the interviewees.

"The issue of burning out is becoming more and more alarming," he told RTHK's Samantha Butler. "Because I think in the past couple of years, Hong Kong has been facing huge challlenges in many aspects: socio-economic, political.

"Also, many people are feeling frustrated and are having emotional and mental illness issues. That's why the workload of social workers, as the helping profession, has immensely increased, together with the intensity of clients' emotional issues, including emotional issues, depression, anxiety disorder or even suicidal issues."]]>

    Inquest experts differ over patient's liver failure

    <![CDATA[A transplant surgeon has stressed that a second organ transplant for a liver disease patient was the only way to keep her alive, as the Coroner’s Court heard conflicting explanations as to why the patient developed acute hepatic failure before her death.

Tang Kwai-sze, a hepatitis B carrier, underwent two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017 and died in August that same year at the age of 44.  

Two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.

Henry Pleass, a transplant surgeon in Australia, said it was unfortunate that medical practitioners did not give Tang medication needed along with the steroids she was taking.

“It’s our modern system with many other doctors looking after one individual. There’s no continuation,” he told the inquest's five-person jury and coroner Monica Chow. 

“We made the assumption that people have thought about the issue, and thought about the risks.”

Tang had experienced medical issues after the first transplant and Pleass said while doctors could have treated her conservatively, the surgery for a new organ gave her a chance of survival. 

On the cause of Tang’s liver failure, Pleass said it was “absolutely” because of a hepatitis B flare-up, ruling out the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis as suggested by another expert witness. 

Earlier, histopathologist Wilson Tsui said it was more likely that Tang suffered from autoimmune hepatitis.

Tsui said the high count of plasma cells and the absence of serologic markers, which are used to identify antibodies formed following an infection, indicated that a hepatitis B flare-up was less likely to have been the case. 

“To differentiate between a reactivation of hepatitis B and autoimmune hepatitis, [the count of plasma cells] is a relatively important index,” he said. 

But James Fung, an expert witness called to give evidence again after Tsui’s testimony, said the majority of patients with an acute hepatitis flare-up would still test negative for such serological markers. 

Fung, a transplant hepatologist at Queen Mary Hospital, also noted that while a higher count of plasma cells is commonly associated with autoimmune hepatitis, there could be exceptions.  

“Especially with very severe acute flares of hepatitis B, [plasma] cells themselves are often seen in these severe cases,” he said. 

The hearing continues.]]>
