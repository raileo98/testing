    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Friday announced that a pilot electronic renminibi programme had been expanded to Hong Kong to include cross-border usage of the digital currency. 

It marks the first time since the launch of the e-CNY pilot scheme in 2019 that the nation's official digital currency was available for use outside of the mainland.

The programme, backed by Beijing, allows Hong Kong residents to open digital yuan wallets using a local mobile number via an app developed by China's central bank - the People's Bank of China.

The expansion of the programme permits users to make payments in retail shops and some online stores in Hong Kong, Macau and other Greater Bay Area cities as well as in other places covered by the pilot scheme.

Hongkongers who use the e-CNY wallets can pay up to 2,000 yuan for each transaction, and are limited to use up to 50,000 yuan worth of purchases per year. 

The apps are operated by four mainland banks, namely Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank as well as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, while users can top up their e-CNY wallets from 17 banks, including HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and Standard Chartered Bank. 

Speaking at a press briefing, the authority's deputy chief executive, Howard Lee, said the expansion of the pilot scheme would make it more convenient for Hongkongers to shop on the mainland.

"This is going to provide an additional means, a safe and secure means for people in Hong Kong to use this wallet across the border when they go there and they have a need to make a payment, or vice versa for mainland users coming to Hong Kong," he explained.

"There are already some other means that can be used for this purpose, but we thought that different people might have different preferences, so one more option is always better than one fewer option."

However, Hong Kong users currently cannot make peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, or electronic money transfers from oneself to another through the e-CNY wallets.]]>

    <![CDATA[A police officer who was earlier found guilty of mortgage fraud involving more than HK$26 million was sentenced on Friday to six and a half years in jail.

Superintendent Harbour Chan was convicted in April of two counts of fraud in connection with two mortgage applications made in 2019 involving a luxury house in Tai Po and a flat in Tung Chung.

Co-defender former chief inspector Wong Ho-ngai was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for one count of fraud. 

In mitigation, Chan's lawyer requested the court to consider an appropriate reduction in sentence given that the defendant grew up in a less privileged family and his enthusiasm in participating in public welfare activities.

Deputy District Judge Edward Wong said the sentencing starting points for the two charges were set at six and a half years and three and a half years. 

Considering the defendant's good personal background and special social contributions, a discretionary reduction in sentence was granted, resulting in a sentence of six and a half years.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Friday said it has given conditional approval to the environmental study into a plan to turn fish ponds in the northern New Territories into a technology hub.

The department's director, Samuel Chui, said the environmental impact assessment on the San Tin Technopole project took into account a large number of ecological survey findings, and officials did not receive any feedback concerning issues the report did not cover.

"The report is scientific, professional and comprehensive. And it doesn't underestimate the ecological value of the area being studied," he told reporters.

Chui added that amendments to the report submitted by the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD), such as birds' names and photos as well as a draft plan to create habitats for animals, did not affect the effectiveness of the study.

He said conditions for the approval include that the CEDD has to submit detailed designs for the project and that it must refrain from filling in fish ponds in the area before creating a new one in a conservation park.

Chui said the CEDD also needs to set up a panel, consisting of green group members and government representatives, to monitor the development's impact on the environment.

"The committee will work together to give the best environmental protection," he said. "Just like this time, we have heard many proposals and we will discuss and find the best way to protect the environment and also to conserve the species and the ecology in the area."

Chui said the CEDD is taking measures to protect Eurasian Otters, a species of conservation importance. The animals were recorded back in 2019, but were not found during a recent ecological survey.

He said the department is adopting suggestions from green groups on building passages for the otters, as well as improving the design of buildings so birds will not crash into them.

The Development Bureau, for its part, welcomed the approval, saying it provides a solid foundation for the government to proceed with the next stage of the town planning process and commence the project as scheduled.]]>

    Surveyors suggest ways to improve subdivided units

    <![CDATA[A minimum area of at least 100 square feet, including the toilet and kitchen, as well as ensuring proper ventilation and drainage, were among the recommendations made by the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors in its report to a government task force on subdivided units.

Various fire protection measures should also be implemented, the institute noted, including no open flame cooking, partition walls installed between units that could block fire for at least one hour, as well as providing a clear fire escape route.

Other recommendations include having at least one openable window towards open space and separating the kitchen and toilet properly.

The institute estimated that about 30 percent of the 110,000 subdivided flats in the city do not meet these minimum standards and require improvements.

Kenny Tse, who chairs the institute’s Building Policy Panel, said that generally it would only cost owners tens of thousands dollars to improve their flats, adding that almost all upgrades could be carried out without affecting the building's common area.

“All the proposed enhancements should be carried out within the subdivided units, not related to the common areas. For example, the fire service installation, we only need to buy a fire extinguisher, smoke detector or something like that,” he said. 

“For the drainage part. This is the only one they need to connect to the common drainage pipe, but I think that this is feasible and also easy to carry out."

The institute also proposed a registration system for subdivided flats, saying owners must entrust professionals to inspect and accredit the units. Such inspection has to be conducted every three years. 

But it said owners of sub-standard units should be given 12 months to make improvements.

“We have to take care of the over 100,000 subdivided units in existing markets and we think that we cannot treat the 100,000 subdivided units at one time,” said Nathan Lee, who heads the institute’s Building Surveying Division. 

“So we should allow some time for the owners to take care of the existing tenants and also provide some relocation for the existing tenants. So we propose 12 months for the modification period.”  

The institute added these were just temporary solutions and the ultimate solution to the subdivided unit issue remained increasing public housing supply.]]>

    <![CDATA[Lawmakers on Friday said they were concerned about growing congestion around the Western Harbour Crossing, after changes to tolls made it the busiest of the three harbour tunnels. 

Official figures show that since a shake-up of tolls in December, traffic flow at the Western Harbour Crossing has increased by 18 percent to around 103,000 vehicles a day, with queues at peak times getting longer.

Acting Deputy Commissioner for Transport Leung Sai-ho said officials are planning to construct an additional lane at the exit of the tunnel on the Hong Kong Island side. 

"Indeed, there's a bottleneck area... I'm sure the project will have a positive impact on the traffic queue and the vehicle speed," he said. 

"If we can increase the capacity of the road section, we believe this can improve the overall performance of the Western Harbour Crossing."

Work on the extra lane is expected to begin in the second half of 2025 and to be completed by 2027.]]>

    <![CDATA[A think tank on Thursday said Hong Kong, being an international financial hub, can speed up the development of hydrogen power through financing initiatives that invest in green and sustainable sources of energy.

Civic Exchange made the recommendation in its study of the clean energy source, before the government publishes its strategy on the topic in the first half of 2024 in a bid to de-carbonise the city.

The think tank's research analyst Wing Tsang said the recently released Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance would make it easier for businesses to identify and invest in green hydrogen projects which were completely zero-carbon.

She said the SAR could also learn from South Korea, where green bonds are issued to finance hydrogen infrastructure.

"Hong Kong is an international financial centre, [we] can line up with the banking institutions, the financial institutions, businesses and the government to make the hydrogen transition happen," she told RTHK.

Tsang added the government also needs to address the high costs and insufficient infrastructure of hydrogen energy.

"Hong Kong currently has no secure and stable supply of hydrogen, and we must identify available sources of hydrogen locally and in close proximity to Hong Kong to propel the application of hydrogen."

The think tank also urged authorities to approve more pilot projects to speed up the development and adoption of hydrogen energy in the city.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Development Bureau on Thursday proposed legislation to make it easier for contractors in the construction sector to get paid on time.

The bill would allow a contractor to claim payment every month, even if it's not specified in their contract. 

That's a change from the current situation, under which disputes are normally settled only when a contract ends.

The bill would also create a new mechanism for settling disputes. A claimant would be able to take their case to an adjudicator, who would make a decision within 55 days. 

If payment doesn't arrive, the claimant would be able to suspend or slow down work, and extend the construction period.

The bureau said it wants to see disputes settled sooner, so everyone involved can get their money faster. It said contractors should see their finances improve, so they can pay workers on time.

Officials expect the Construction Industry Security of Payment Bill to pass later this year and to take effect next year.]]>

    'Social workers may be banned for life by convictions'

    <![CDATA[The government on Thursday said social workers could in future be banned from the profession for life, if they were convicted of a crime which could warrant a prison sentence.

It is among a series of proposed legal changes the administration said would improve the statutory body overseeing the profession, as it accused the body of deviating from the spirit of the law. 

Officials want to reform the Social Workers Registration Board such that there'd be more appointed members than elected ones, while in future, all 27 board members would need to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR. 

Under the plan, social workers convicted of lesser offences that may be considered to harm the reputation of the profession would also be subject to a permanent expulsion, or a ban of no more than five years as decided by the board.

The person concerned could write to the board within 28 days to oppose the decision.

As for more serious crimes such as national security offences, murder, sex offences and child abuse, the board would promptly expel the social worker unless the whole board votes otherwise.

Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Thursday described the proposals as nothing major, stressing that deregistration decisions would continue to be made by the board.

"We're not amending such broad principles [over deregistration]. What we're saying is that we mustn't and shouldn't wait, and there's a new provision to allow for the prompt removal," he told lawmakers at a special Legco panel meeting on the matter.

Sun also accused the current board of dereliction of duty for not taking any steps to implement legal changes related to national security. 

He said it should have actively gathered information on whether social workers seeking to renew their licences "may have committed security-related crimes".

Still, New People's Party's Judy Chan expressed concern that social services would be under affected after the changes, saying there might be a scenario where a group of social workers were disqualified.

The minister dismissed this, saying he thinks most social workers shouldn't have a problem getting their licences renewed.

Sun also stressed the legal amendments only require future board members to take an oath, rather than all registered social workers.]]>

    Govt unveils new measures to cope with extreme weather

    <![CDATA[The government on Thursday announced a series of measures intended to help Hong Kong cope better with extreme weather, including new arrangements for MTR services when the second-highest typhoon signal is in force.

Trains on overground sections of the network will continue until the end of the line, or at least to a large station where passengers can take shelter, instead of only stopping at the next station when the No 9 typhoon signal is in force. 

Last year, scores of travellers were left stranded at the the airport when Typhoon Koinu forced the suspension of the Airport Express and all bus services. 

"In case the train is already in this open section, we will try to reach the final destination as far as practicable and safety permitting," Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung said at a cross-departmental press conference.
 
"If not, we're now planning to stop at a major station in which that station may be big or may be connected to the mall or other commercial areas so that people or passengers could have a better place for shelter so that they can depart the area when the weather allows."

Meanwhile, Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk warned that people who deliberately and repeatedly put themselves in jeopardy during extreme weather may face fines or even prison. 

Cheuk gave the example of people going onto beaches that are closed, adding that the risk is simply not worth it. 

"What we're aiming to do is dissuade people from having some sort of high risk, very risky activities. If anything happens, it's not just costing them HK$2,000 or 14 days in prison. It will cost their life. It's also endangering the life of my emergency response officers. So what we're saying is do not do something dangerous. Do not put yourself at risk," he said. 

Cheuk also said the observatory will issue advice and warnings to members of the public during adverse weather, adding that a city-wide SMS alert system is only reserved for "unforeseen situations" such as tsunamis. 

Asked about arrangements when water is discharged from the Shenzhen Reservoir, officials said they will alert Hongkongers as soon as authorities across the border start considering such a move.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Children’s Hospital on Thursday said it would open the SAR's first breast milk bank next year. 

It would collect milk from breastfeeding mothers who produce surplus milk, which would then be used to help premature and critically ill babies whose mothers were unable to breastfeed. 

The bank would only accept donations from healthy mothers who don't smoke. 

Dr Lee Tsz-leung, the hospital's chief executive, said the donated breast milk would benefit the health of premature babies.  
 
"It carries significant benefits for pre-term babies. It will reduce complication. It will reduce mortality rate. It will reduce the length of stay in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) and also it will promote the neurological development of these premature babies as well," he said. 

The aim is to collect about 800 litres of milk each year, which would benefit up to 600 newborns.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Consumer Council on Thursday said many mosquito repellents may not deliver on their marketing, with one brand it checked seemingly attracting the insects instead of keeping them away. 

Checks on Cherub Rubs Scatterbugs found that more mosquitos landed on the tester's forearm than before it was applied. 

Of the 25 repellent brands examined, only one sample, containing Deet, passed the test perfectly, with no mosquitoes landing on the tester's arm. 

Some natural or herbal brands repelled certain types of mosquito, but not those that spread dengue fever.

Speaking at a press briefing, Kenneth Chan, the Vice-Chairman of the council's Publicity and Community Relations Committee, said consumers should choose the products carefully.

"Mosquito repellent products with chemical or natural ingredients each have their own advantages and drawbacks. Consumers may consult physicians and pharmacists and choose suitable products according to usage and health conditions," he added. 

Chan also urged the makers of mosquito repellents to list out the ingredients in the label clearly and state whether the product is suitable for children.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Consumer Council on Thursday warned that the personal data of people who use apps to block spam callers could be at risk because some of these apps pass on the information to third parties.

The watchdog investigated five such apps and found that two of them uploaded details from the user’s list of contacts onto their databases.

The council found that third parties could then access sensitive details including addresses and the monthly rents the contacts paid. 

It's suspected these were extracted from the contact lists of landlords or property agents who also used the apps. 

The council found that one of the apps would also access up to eight items of personal data, including names, photos and dates of birth, when registered via Facebook. 

Speaking at a press briefing, Kenneth Chan, the Vice-Chairman of the council's Publicity and Community Relations Committee, reminded users to stay vigilant when using these apps.

"Consumers should pay attention to the following when using blocker apps. Read the terms of service and privacy policy before use, and evaluate whether the blocker app is trustworthy and the permission is reasonably commensurate with the functions offered," he added. 

Despite the privacy risk, Chan also called on users to proactively report spam to help apps identify and block the latest telemarketing and spam calls.]]>

The SAR, which hosted Olympic qualifying last month, will stage the final of the World Tour for the first time on November 23 and 24. 

Matthew Li, media director of the local organising committee, said the top 11 teams in the season will automatically qualify for the Hong Kong Final. 

He added that the team representing Hong Kong will also have a chance to participate if they make it through a play-in tournament against the 12th ranked team and the team with the most combined Challenger and World Tour wins.

Li said the event will also have a 3x3 village with local influences from the Cheung Chau Bun Festival.

"This time we are trying to add some more local culture elements to the carnival. We are trying to make some deal or make some discussion with the authorities in Cheung Chau. We will maybe try to make something different, maybe some local culture things to the November event," he said.

"I think as we will have many more international 3x3 events and also FIBA think we will add a showcase for the tour. We hope it will get more international recognition for Hong Kong as a sport city."

This year's World Tour will feature 17 stops with Ub Huishan NE looking to defend their title as two-time reigning champions.]]>

    <![CDATA[Tentative results of a Pay Trend Survey that would help adjust civil service pay were released on Thursday, but organisers said it would be "premature" for people to presume the administration will adopt their figures.

The survey, based on data gathered from more than 110 private firms, points to rises of 4.01 percent for senior civil servants, 4.32 percent for middle-ranking workers and 5.47 percent for junior staff.

“The numbers are not themselves recommendations in any way for an increase, decrease or anything. They are factors to be considered among a number of other factors," said Laurence Li, who chairs the Pay Trend Survey Committee.

"I think it's premature to try to forecast how these things will all be put into the pot." 

The government said other factors to consider when looking at pay rises for civil servants are the state of the economy, changes in the cost of living, the administration's fiscal position, pay claims from staff and civil service morale. 

Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service Clement Leung was asked whether different weight will be put on the various factors when making a decision. 

“Each year, in a way, is a separate exercise, because the economic situation, the situation of the government's fiscal position are different. Every time we will have to have two-way communications with our staff side's representatives," Leung said.

“That will be something that we will have to work on in the next few weeks, and particularly, listening to the views of our staff associations on their sentiments and their views on civil service morale, as well as their proposals." 

Last year, senior civil servants received pay rises of 2.87 percent, while those in middle and junior ranks got 4.65 percent. This was roughly in line with the results of that year's pay trend survey.

    <![CDATA[Some 2,500 policymakers, academics and medical professionals on Thursday gathered at the Convention and Exhibition Centre for a two-day summit on health innovation and investment. 

The "Asia Summit on Global Health", jointly organised by the government and the Trade Development Council, features a series of thematic sessions on the latest trends in different medical sectors.  

In his opening speech, Chief Executive John Lee highlighted the importance of public health.

"Health is wealth. Health is an ever-revolving discipline that affects all of humanity. It affects the lives of every individual in any economy of the world, big or small, rich or poor, liberal or conservative. Public health is the foundation of society and the very basis of humankind to thrive," he said. 

Lee also told the summit that the SAR thrives as an international metropolis that maintains unparalleled connectivity with both the mainland and the rest of the world.

Cao Xuetao, the vice-minister of the National Health Commission, told the same event that Hong Kong has been using its geopolitical advantages to promote healthcare development.  

"As an international centre for finance, shipping, trade, innovation and technology, Hong Kong has actively leveraged its advantage of having the strong support of the country and being closely connected to the world to innovate in medicine and health," he said. 

The mainland official added that it is crucial to work together and explore new opportunities in the field of medicine and health given complex changes in the international situation.]]>

    <![CDATA[The final of the Cheung Chau "Bun Scrambling" competition was held on Wednesday night at 12 midnight on the football pitch of the Pak Tai Temple Recreation Ground in Cheung Chau, rounding off a day of festivities attended by tens of thousands of people.

Firefighter Yip Kin-man was crowned "Bun King" and nurse Kung Tsz-shan won the title of "Bun Queen."

Nine male and three female finalists competed at the same time, clambering up a 14-metre-high mountain covered in 9,000 plastic buns.

They had to fill their own bags with buns totalling the most points within the time limit of 3 minutes, to win the coveted titles.

Kwok Ka-ming, a regular contestant and one of the favourites for the men's title, won the “Full Pocket of Lucky Buns” prize for snatching the most buns.

The Cheung Chau Bun Festival originated as a ritual for people to pray for safety from a plague.]]>

    'HK, Singapore to keep complementary roles'

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong and Singapore will maintain their ties as both “complementors” and “competitors” as they navigate their way through an increasingly complex geopolitical environment, a veteran businessman with cross-market experience in both places said on Wednesday. 

The remarks came as the Lion City ushered in a new era, with finance minister Lawrence Wong becoming the city-state’s first new prime minister in 20 years, taking over from Lee Hsien Loong who becomes senior minister of the cabinet.

“I think it's very positive,” said Dennis Chiu, chairman of the Hong Kong Singapore Business Association (HSBA). 

“He [Wong] really reflects the meritocracy system of Singapore, because he came from the very bottom of the ladder and then worked his way all up. He is very much a student of the Singapore system to show that.. in Singapore, anybody has a chance to reach the very top,” Chiu said.

When asked how the new leadership might impact the business ties between the Lion City and the SAR, Chiu, who is also the executive director of Far East Consortium International and has straddled Hong Kong and Singapore for three decades, said he expects there will be “continuity” in terms of trade and business cooperation between the two places.

“Singapore and Hong Kong have always played a complementary and competing role. And when you compete, you actually pick up good points from the other, so I think we are mutually learning from each other, but we also compete for the same dollar of investments,” Chiu said.

“I really don’t see there will be huge changes, but I think we will perhaps see how changes in the world will affect Hong Kong and Singapore,” he added, warning that geopolitics has become the most challenging factor affecting all economies, especially open economies like the two cities.

“You have to be neutral and to not choose a side,” he said.

The real estate veteran also said Hong Kong and Singapore could continue to cooperate in areas such as technology and digitisation, adoption of artificial intelligence, and green transition.

“Hong Kong, frankly speaking, has the huge market of China and the Greater Bay Area, [but] Singapore has Southeast Asia as its very important market. Those will always be the strengths of both of the cities’ finances,” Chiu added.

“I think he [Wong] will be able to continue to carry on Lee's systems with him, we do not expect any new changes for the time being, but we want to see how he will be tested when new issues, such as Covid and international crises, come up,” he said. "This is something we all do not know."]]>
