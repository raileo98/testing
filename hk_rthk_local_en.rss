    <![CDATA[The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said China is gravely concerned about the prosecution in the UK of three people allegedly working for Hong Kong's intelligence service, and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the country.

“For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.

“China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.”

Britain on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to the UK to state that espionage and cyberattacks were not acceptable on its soil.

The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ambassador Zheng Zeguang had been called to a meeting to be told that “the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyberattacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.”

The Chinese Embassy in London accused Britain of fabricating the charges against the three men.

Zheng said the UK should not interfere in Hong Kong and China's affairs, and should stop making anti-China political provocations.

He also said Britain should not provide refuge to wanted criminals. (Agencies)]]>

    Mixed reactions to approved taxi fare increases

    <![CDATA[People are divided over the authorities' move to approve an increase in taxi fares, with some saying the rise is affordable and others complaining about poor taxi services.

The Executive Council has approved a HK$2 increase in flagfalls, meaning from July 14, the starting fares will be HK$29 for urban taxis, HK$25.5 for New Territories cabs, and HK$24 for Lantau taxis. Incremental charges will also rise.

A student RTHK spoke to in Kowloon Tong said the fare increase is acceptable. However, he acknowledged that frequent taxi users may not be happy. 

"I am not a frequent user, so I think it is still affordable. But for some people, they may travel quite frequently on taxis. This may be a consideration for them," he said.  

A mother who often takes her children by taxi thinks that taxi drivers deserve a higher income for their hard work. 

"I don't think it's a big deal. I think they deserve more money because they work really hard and very long hours. Life has become more expensive, so we have to also expect that this increase needs to happen for the drivers, right?" she said. 
 
A passenger said that taxi drivers should improve their services before they are allowed to increase their fares. 

"The price is a bit high considering their performance. The taxi service is so bad in Hong Kong. Nowadays, we don't have a way to reflect the performance of the taxi drivers. If they behave badly, we don't have a way to complain," he said. 

A taxi driver said he's worried that the fare hike could lead to a further drop in passenger numbers. 

"My concern is that if fares increase, we might see a drop in the number of passengers. Business is already tough, especially during the evening shift when fewer people go out."

However, another taxi driver believes passengers will find the fare increase acceptable. 

"I think it's a reasonable increase. Passengers will eventually get used to it. Considering inflation, a slight rise in taxi fares should be acceptable to them," he said.]]>

    Exco approves HK$2 rise in taxi flagfall rates

    <![CDATA[Taxi fares are set to go up after the Executive Council approved increases for cabs on Tuesday, but it was far from the jump the trade had asked for. 

The industry had suggested a HK$5 increase in the flagfall for urban taxis, and set the initial charges for other cabs at HK$28.

Instead, the flagfall for urban taxis will increase from HK$27 to HK$29, while the starting rates will be HK$25.5 in the New Territories and HK$24 on Lantau.

The incremental charges will also be raised, with a 20-cent increase per metre jump for the first-tier distance after flagfall for urban taxis. Passengers of green and blue cabs will see the incremental rates after flagfall rise from HK$1.7 to HK$1.9. 

For second-tier distances, there will be an increase of 10 cents for all three types of taxis. 

The new fares are expected to take effect from July 14 after negative vetting by the Legislative Council. 

A government spokesperson said it is important to review taxi fares to ensure a stable supply of services to cater for passengers' needs. 

"The taxi trade is facing genuine difficulty in maintaining the financial viability of its operation at the current taxi fare level," a statement read. 

"The taxi trade hopes that an increase in taxi fares would raise the income of front-line drivers and attract more newcomers to join the industry, while at the same time encouraging taxi operators to improve their services and invest more in new facilities, thereby enhancing the overall taxi service quality and fostering the healthy development of the trade in the long run."

The government also noted the approved increases were lower than the levels proposed by the taxi trade, adding the fare hike would “inevitably lead to higher transportation expenses for passengers”.

Taxi charges last went up in July 2022.]]>

    Exco endorses plan to reform social worker board

    <![CDATA[The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a plan to reform the statutory body overseeing social workers that will change the composition so that appointed members outnumber those elected. 

Speaking on the revamp, Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun said the sector doesn't need to worry about the autonomy of the Social Workers Registration Board.

At present, six of the board's 15 members are appointed, eight are elected and there is one official from the Social Welfare Department.

In future, 17 members will be appointed, eight will be elected and there will be two social welfare officials.

Last week, Sun said governance of the body must be improved because it has deviated from the spirit of the law. He said, for example, the board had appointed to its disciplinary body a social worker who was facing a charge of rioting.

Sun told reporters on Tuesday that in future, all board members must take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.

"The board exercises public authority. What this means is that the registration of Hong Kong's 27,000 social workers, the disciplinary hearings involving them, all these are to do with public authority," he said.

"So requiring members of a statutory body exercising such authority to swear allegiance, this is only natural. It will ensure that members can safeguard our national security and that they uphold the Basic Law and bear allegiance to the SAR government."

Sun said at least 14 of the 27 members of the board in future will be social workers.

"Everyone needs to understand that the source of social workers should actually be diverse. Some of them would be elected, others would be appointed," the minister said.

"The diversity at the board means that some of the social workers might be renowned professors, some might be respected leaders at social welfare organisations. This would allow for the board's operations to be more diverse and balanced."

He added that the board will also be tasked with setting continuing professional development requirements for the sector.

The government added in a statement that the relevant legal changes, if passed by lawmakers, will enable "the prompt removal" of social workers convicted of serious offences.

It said the proposed legal changes will be gazetted on Friday, with a bill to be tabled to the legislature on May 22.]]>

    <![CDATA[Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Tuesday said that Hong Kong is well-positioned to promote global collaboration and contribute to world prosperity, as the city kicked off its first-ever conference with a focus on geopolitics.

Speaking at the inaugural “Global Prosperity Summit 2024”, Ip warned that Hong Kong faces a “high degree of global geopolitical risks” due to the looming threats of “rising polarisation and political violence”.

She said these threats were challenging global governance, and have led to protectionist policies of tariff hikes, financial sanctions and export controls to “deny developing countries’ access to advanced technology”.

“The world is being factored into opposing geopolitical blocks, the free trade and investment environment over the past decades, which have helped hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, seems to belong to a bygone era,” Ip said.

“With national elections in 64 countries, affecting 49 percent of the world’s population, taking place this year, politics seems to trump economics everywhere,” she added, noting that signs of polarisation and political violence were also on the rise.

Ip said Hong Kong has a keen interest in promoting ways to resolve such issues, as it is a small but open economy that has a high degree of exposure to global risks.

“We are a very international and cosmopolitan society, and we are very well-connected. We understand the cultures and political systems of mainland China as well as the culture and systems of the West, so we are well positioned, really, to maximise our role as a super connector and an intermediary between mainland China and the rest of the world,” she told reporters.

Separately, Ip told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme the SAR is a very suitable place to host the prosperity summit given its reputation as a meeting point between East and West.

“This summit showcases Hong Kong as a platform for international dialogue and communication, because we are able to bring together experts, prominent scholars, former senior officials from all over the world to debate on the issues,” she told RTHK.

“When we have a free trade investment environment, everybody benefits, and we don’t want this to stop,” she added.

The three-day summit event is sponsored by local businesses and the government and is co-hosted by the think tank Savantas Policy Institute which Ip chairs, covering topics such as de-globalisation, technological cooperation and climate change.]]>

    Advances in imaging tech gives hope to stroke patients

    <![CDATA[A study from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Tuesday showed that more than a third of stroke patients who were treated beyond the traditional six-hour golden period had recovered well, offering hope to those once thought untreatable. 
 
The researchers studied more than 50 stroke patients who were treated beyond six hours, with the most notable case being a patient who was treated 22 hours after his stroke.

One of the HKU researchers, Associate Professor of Surgery Kevin Cheng, explained that the key to this medical breakthrough lies in advances in imaging technology, which now allows doctors to assess the proportion of brain cells that can be saved, enabling more targeted interventions.

"In the past, if we just base on a plain CT scan, we cannot estimate the area of the brain having damage. We can just see if there is any blood," he said 

"But with the advancement in the CT perfusion, we can differentiate...which part of the brain is still salvageable and the total volume and the mismatch ratio. So these factors are very accurate and can help us to accurately differentiate those patients who can benefit."

Acute ischaemic stroke is caused by a blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain. Brain cells can quickly die while the flow of oxygen and nutrients is restricted, leading to loss of brain function, paralysis, speech problems and even death.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) on Tuesday said the SAR saw 3.4 million visitor arrivals in April – a 17 percent increase year-on-year.

It said provisional figures show about 2.5 million of the arrivals, or 73 percent, were from the mainland.

The HKTB said there was an increase of more than 50 percent in arrivals from other countries compared to April last year, with a more than 80 percent rise from Indonesia, driven by the end of Ramadan.

Meanwhile, visitor arrivals from long-haul markets such as the US and Canada increased by more than 80 percent year-on-year.

The HKTB said about 14.6 million visitor arrivals were recorded in the first four months of the year, which was double the figure from the same period in 2023.]]>

    <![CDATA[Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that any attempt to interfere with the legitimate operations of Hong Kong’s Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) would only end up harming the economies of the countries that take such action.

He was speaking after a manager of the government’s ETO in London, Bill Yuen, was arrested with two others on suspicion of breaching Britain's national security law and charged with assisting Hong Kong intelligence officers.

"Any attempt to interfere with the work of the ETOs in different places will be against free trade and free economy, and will be harming the economy of the countries that try to do bad things to the operation of the ETOs," Lee said.

He told reporters that the duties of the trade offices are to liaise with foreign officials, businesses, think tanks and representatives of various sectors, to boost links and promote the economic and trade interests of the SAR.

"Any attempt to make unwarranted allegations against the SAR government is unacceptable," the chief executive said.

"The ETOs will of course pursue their duties full-heartedly and legitimately."

He also noted that the the Chinese Embassy in Britain has made serious representations to UK officials, while the SAR government is still waiting for British authorities to respond to its demand for more information on the allegations.

The Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the SAR has accused Britain of arbitrarily arresting Chinese citizens and slandering the Hong Kong government, saying this violates the principles of international law.

Lee also said a photo of him and Yuen that is circulating online was taken more than two decades ago to mark their graduation from the Australian School of Policing.

The CE said that is the only impression he has of Yuen.]]>

    <![CDATA[Tourists hailing from eight mainland cities will be welcomed with HK$200 vouchers for restaurants and shops, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.

Last week, the central government added eight new cities, including Urumqi, Hohhot and Heilongjiang to the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS), allowing residents to travel to the SAR without joining a tour group.

Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he expects visitors from the eight cities to provide a large boost to Hong Kong's tourism sector.

"The IVS is the main source of tourists for Hong Kong. It contributed 60 percent of all mainland tourist arrivals last year. The eight cities come with large populations and they also have significant economic growth, with high spending power," he said.

"The eight cities are located in the north, northwest and northeast of China respectively. They are further away from Hong Kong, when compared with the other cities under the IVS. This will bring in a lot of overnight visitors, largely increase per capita spending, and revenues from tourism and related sectors will increase exponentially."

Lee said the authorities have a series of measures to attract more tourists, including the HK$200 vouchers.

He added that a drone show at the weekend received rave reviews.

"Our purpose is to let locals and visitors feel the joy, when they participate in these activities. We hope to use activities to bring liveliness, and use liveliness to bring more money," he said.]]>

    <![CDATA[The Education Bureau on Tuesday said a secondary school teacher failed to return to Hong Kong after taking part in a four-day mainland study tour last week, following claims online that the educator was arrested for allegedly soliciting a prostitute. 

An online forum post suggested that a teacher of a subsidised school in Tin Shui Wai was picked up by mainland authorities while on a trip to Wuhan.

The bureau said a mainland study tour for new teachers in Wuhan, which was held between May 8 and 11, wrapped up as scheduled, but it was notified that one member could not return to the SAR along with the group.

"The Education Bureau attaches great importance to the discipline of participating teachers, and has required the school submit a report. The bureau will also comprehensively review relevant information and handle the case seriously. No further comments will be made at this stage," it said. 

"The bureau will maintain close contact with the school and continue to follow up on the incident." 

Education authorities also said teachers participating in mainland study tours must depart and return to Hong Kong as scheduled, and that they are reminded to be careful with their words and actions and to be law-abiding. 

Any cases of professional misconduct would be strictly followed up in accordance with the established mechanism, the bureau added.

RTHK has reached out to the school in question for comment.]]>

    <![CDATA[The culture, sports and tourism minister, Kevin Yeung, on Monday said it was unacceptable that repeated mistakes were made by the chairwoman of the city's weightlifting and powerlifting body. 

He also called on Josephine Ip of the Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association to publicly address her mistakes. 

"It is unacceptable for the same mistakes to happen over and over. We hope that the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China can come up with a long-term solution so that similar incidents won't happen again," Yeung said.

"Because in both instances the chairwoman was at fault, she should explain to the public herself."

The association had apologised for a remark made by Ip during a competition on May 6. The event featured competitors from 13 countries along with the SAR and Chinese Taipei, and Ip said it had "lifters and officials from 13 countries".

Her remark drew condemnation from the administration on Friday, which called Ip's remarks "absolutely unacceptable".

"The statement is grossly inconsistent with the fact that delegations from Hong Kong, China and Chinese Taipei participated as regional teams. It gives rise to suspected violation of the one-China principle," a government spokesperson said in a statement.

The sports body explained the chairwoman made the blunder with the intention of simplifying a long sentence while giving a speech at the opening ceremony of the Asian Equipped Powerlifting Championship and the Asian University Cup.

On another occasion, she described Hong Kong as a "relatively small country", which the association said was a "slip of the tongue".

The minister said the administration would take appropriate action based on findings of the investigation to ensure people speaking on behalf of a sports association or the sector understood that every single word is very important.

The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, for its part, said it is reviewing the report submitted by the weightlifting and powerlifting body and would keep in contact with the government how to handle the matter.]]>

    <![CDATA[London's Metropolitan Police on Monday said three men were charged with allegedly assisting Hong Kong intelligence services and with foreign interference.

The men have appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged under Britain's National Security Act.

Chi Leung Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, have each been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service. They were not asked to enter any pleas to the charges and will next appear in court on May 24. All three men were granted bail.

Seven men and one woman who were not charged were released from custody, police added.

The Chinese Embassy in the UK said it has made serious representations to UK officials over the matter.

"The Chinese side firmly rejects and strongly condemns the UK’s fabrication of the so-called case and its unwarranted accusation against the HKSAR government," it said in a statement.

The SAR Government said it had "demanded the UK Government to provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter concerned, and the latter's response is awaited".

"The duties of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London are to maintain close liaison with interlocutors in the local government, business, think tanks and various sectors, with a view to enriching bilateral ties in different areas such as trade, investment, arts and culture, enhancing local people and enterprises' knowledge of Hong Kong's unique strengths, and promoting the economic and trade interests of Hong Kong," it said in a statement.

It said it had demanded that London "fairly handle the matter, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office's Office Manager who was alleged to be involved, and ensure that the normal work of the Economic and Trade Office is not affected".

London police said a total of 11 people had been detained earlier this month, nearly all of whom were arrested in the Yorkshire area in northern England.

A police spokesman said, “this investigation remains ongoing, but now that charges have been brought, I urge people not to speculate or comment further in relation to this case.” (Agencies)

The suspects, aged between 19 and 69, were also charged with offences such as driving unlicensed vehicles and using them on pavements.

Officers added that they seized 34 electric bikes and scooters in various areas in the New Territories, such as Tuen Mun, Yuen Long and Lok Ma Chau, in a two-day operation last week.

    Take care of ethnic minority Chinese tourists too: DAB

    <![CDATA[Hong Kong's tourism industry should learn to be more accommodating to ethnic minority travellers from the mainland, DAB lawmakers said on Monday, after the central government announced it was adding eight more cities to the individual visit scheme.

From May 27, residents from eight more cities – including Hohhot of Inner Mongolia, Lhasa of Tibet, and Urumqi of Xinjiang – will be able to visit Hong Kong without joining tour groups. 

Lawmaker Kennedy Wong pointed out the expansion meant more mainland visitors who are from ethnic minority communities coming to Hong Kong, including Mongolians, Zhuang people, and Hui people, and that the SAR had to be prepared to welcome them. 

"Hong Kong's tourism industry, and actually every one of us here, should be more accommodating and should be more understanding towards the minority travellers' needs. For example, for Muslims and for Mongolians, they have their eating habits and they also have their own culture," Wong said. 

"Some of these minority travellers probably prefer their own languages. Apart from the ability to speak Putonghua, perhaps in some signage and some areas we also need to display their languages too." 

Starry Lee, another DAB legislator and also Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, urged officials to consider arranging more direct flights from those mainland cities. 

There are currently direct flights from just four of these newly added cities – Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, and Urumqi, with airlines planning to add Harbin next month. 
 
Lee also renewed calls for Beijing to raise the duty-free goods allowance for mainland tourists from 5,000 to 30,000 yuan per person for each trip, while capping the amount at 200,000 yuan.]]>

    <![CDATA[Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun said on Monday there was "nothing political" about him saying the governance of the statutory body overseeing social workers must be improved, and that the motivation was about raising the sector's professional standards. 

Last Friday, he wrote on social media accusing the Social Workers Registration Board of ignoring society's overall interests, damaging the professionalism and credibility of the sector by deviating from the spirit of the law.

Specifically, he wrote that the board had renewed the licences or approved licence applications of people who'd committed serious offences in the past, while approving a social worker facing a rioting charge to join its disciplinary committee panel.

The minister said improvements must be made to implement the principle of patriots administering Hong Kong.

Currently, the board has 15 members - eight of whom are elected, with six appointed and an official from the Social Welfare Department.

Speaking to reporters, Sun didn't say whether the government plans to appoint more members to the board. 

He said it would announce its reform package once it's ready.

Sun also dismissed an argument from the board's chairman, Ng Yut-ming, that the minister had misunderstandings regarding how the board operates.

"There's no misunderstanding - I have complete information about what's going on in the board," the minister said.

Social welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said he hopes the board won't become a political battlefield.

Tik said that if the government decides to go ahead and add more appointed members, he hoped it wouldn’t be because it wanted to gain the majority of the board and exert greater influence.

The lawmaker also proposed that future appointed members be nominated or recommended by universities or professional bodies as they'd be considered impartial.

"If you want to improve the registration board, it has to include the element of professionalism," he said.

"I suggest that the scholars from the universities or members of the professional body would increase the content and element of professionalism. I also imagine it will be more easily accepted by our professional sector."

Tik hoped that officials would consult social workers regarding the reform proposal in future.]]>

    Community living rooms to open in summer: Chris Sun

    <![CDATA[Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Monday said he hopes the community living rooms in To Kwa Wan, Hung Hom and Nam Cheong would open by the end of the summer holidays, as part of efforts to help the newly identified 950,000 people for targeted poverty alleviation.

Speaking at a Legco panel meeting, Sun hoped the three facilities, aimed at providing support for grassroots families, would be able to serve residents in summer after undergoing outfitting works.

Lawmaker Connie Lam asked whether there were plans to expand the shared-space project to more districts to help more people living in poor conditions.  

“Apart from subdivided unit households, people living in cages or caged homes and cubicles also need these kind of community living rooms. There are a lot of such kinds of residential developments in Sha Tin, in Lohas Park in Tseung Kwan O, there are also subdivided units…Will the government expand the programme to other districts?” she asked.

In response, Sun said it’s not easy for the government to identify locations for these living rooms. 

“Subdivided unit households are concentrated in urban areas and as a result it's difficult for the government to identify a venue to establish a community living room. That is why we have to rely on the business sector to identify such a venue for us,” he said.

At the same meeting, lawmakers also questioned whether a new framework for poverty measurement could reflect the actual poverty situation and target underprivileged groups.

The government identified around 950,000 elderly people, single-parent households and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation. It will no longer use median household income to define poverty.

Welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said officials shouldn’t scrap the poverty line because it can keep the public informed about the impoverished population.

“Of course, the poverty line is contentious elsewhere in the world, but the poverty line works in two ways — we can tell the trend; we can see whether the impoverished population is growing or shrinking. The poverty line can also help us keep an eye on the performance of the government,” he said.

The welfare chief responded by saying the government had been putting a lot of resources into poverty alleviation through various social welfare programmes.]]>

    <![CDATA[The DAB on Monday called on the government to clarify its revised rules on employment agencies, saying they were unclear. 

The party's comments came after the Labour Department released a revised code of practice last week which aims to discourage domestic helpers from "job hopping", and to safeguard consumer rights.

Speaking at a press briefing, DAB lawmaker Frankie Ngan urged authorities to better stipulate the measure.

"The DAB requests the government to do more promotion and education for the agencies, especially as it is a new regulation for them," he said

"Could the government implement the instruction for the employer and the employee at the same time to make sure that they deeply understand the new regulation for the agency and the new agreement?"

Ngan also called on the government to limit the borrowing capacity of foreign domestic helpers, as he and other DAB party members have received complaints from employers who are frustrated by lenders who pursue the money that helpers failed to pay back before departing from Hong Kong.

"We request the government [to] make a financial credit database for those financial institutes to see [how much a] particular domestic helper borrowed," he said.

"We request the government to consider, [to] set an upper limit for the borrowing loan to the domestic helpers."

The DAB also suggested the government introduce a tax reduction scheme for people hiring foreign domestic helpers to reduce their burden on arranging health checks and training classes for the helpers.]]>

    Divided views on direct flights for mainland visitors

    <![CDATA[Representatives of the retail and hotel industries on Monday praised the move to boost Hong Kong's tourism sector by adding eight mainland cities to the individual visit scheme, but views were divided on whether direct flights from those cities were necessary.

From May 27, travellers from Taiyuan in Shanxi Province, Hohhot of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Harbin in Heilongjiang, Lhasa in Tibet, Lanzhou in Gansu, Xining in Qinghai, Yinchuan in Ningxia, and Urumqi in Xinjiang will be able to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis, instead of on tour groups.

Currently, there are direct flights from just four cities - Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, and Urumqi, with airlines planning to add Harbin next month.

Alan Chan from the Miramar Group, which owns two hotels in the city, said travellers from further afield tend to spend more money, adding that tourists from the eight cities would be a big boost to the tourism sector here.

"Visitors from those eight places will be the most wealthy people there...there are rich people in every city. For example, Shanxi doesn't have a very strong economy but there are bosses who own coal businesses there," the group's chief operations officer told an RTHK programme.

He said with a new road which links Shenzhen airport and Shenzhen Bay opening next month, it would be convenient for mainland travellers to come to the SAR even if there are no direct flights.

But Liberal Party legislator Peter Shiu, who represents the retail sector, said businesses here would get a greater boost if there are direct flights from all eight cities.

"If tourists fly to Hong Kong directly, they would spend the night here during their trip. But if they fly to Shenzhen first and then come to Hong Kong, will they spend some time in Shenzhen before visiting us, or come to Hong Kong during the day and spend the night in Shenzhen?" he said.

"We have to think about this because usually tourists who stay the night here spend more money than those who don't."]]>
